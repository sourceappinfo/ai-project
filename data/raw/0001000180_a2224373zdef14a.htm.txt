"Board" and each member thereof, a "Director") of SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company," "SanDisk," "we," "us," or "our"), of proxies to be voted at the Company's 2015 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on June 18, 2015, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, for the purposes described herein. Stockholders of record at the close
of business on April 20, 2015 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The Annual Meeting will be held at 8:00 a.m., local time, on June 18, 2015, at
the Company's headquarters, 951 SanDisk Drive, Milpitas, CA 95035. These
materials will be made available to stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting on or about April 27, 2015. Important Notice Regarding Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and Annual Report Pursuant to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Company is furnishing its proxy materials and
Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Proxy Materials") primarily via the Internet. Accordingly, the Company will send a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to its
stockholders of record and beneficial owners on or about May 1, 2015. All stockholders will have the ability to access the Proxy Materials on the website referred to in the Notice or to request
a printed set of the Proxy Materials. Instructions on how to access the Proxy Materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy of the Proxy Materials may be found in the Notice. In addition,
stockholders may request to receive the Proxy Materials in printed form by mail, or electronically by e-mail, on an ongoing basis. Choosing
to receive future Proxy Materials electronically saves the Company the cost of printing and mailing documents to its stockholders, expedites receipt of the materials and
conserves natural resources. If a stockholder chooses to receive future Proxy Materials electronically, the stockholder will receive an e-mail for each future proxy material distribution with
instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Any stockholder's election to receive the Proxy Materials electronically will remain in effect until such
stockholder terminates the request. The
Proxy Materials are also available at the Company's website at www.sandisk.com/IR. In addition, the Company will provide copies of any of the Proxy Materials free of charge to any
stockholder who
requests copies by calling 1-800-579-1639 or by sending an e-mail with the 12-Digit Control Number found on the Notice or proxy card in the subject line to sendmaterial@proxyvote.com. Voting Rights On the Record Date, approximately 207,919,199 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock") were outstanding and entitled
to vote at the Annual Meeting. The presence in person or by proxy of a majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual
Meeting. 1 Table of Contents In
addition to voting in person at the Annual Meeting, stockholders may vote by proxy as follows: Internet. A stockholder can submit a proxy over the Internet by following the instructions provided in the Notice or on the separate
proxy card or
voting information form. Telephone. A stockholder can submit a proxy over the telephone by following the instructions provided in the proxy card or separate
voting
information form. Mail. A stockholder that received a printed set of the Proxy Materials can submit a proxy by mail by completing, signing and returning
the separate
proxy card in the prepaid and addressed envelope included with the Proxy Materials. Stockholders
are urged to specify their votes on the proxy they submit by Internet, telephone or mail. If you submit a proxy, but do not specify how you want to vote on a proposal, in
the absence of contrary instructions, the shares of Common Stock represented by such proxy will be voted as the Board
recommends on each proposal and the persons named as proxies will vote on any other matters properly presented at the Annual Meeting in accordance with their best judgment. Stockholder votes will be
tabulated by a representative of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Each
share of Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date is entitled to one vote on each of the eight Director nominees and one vote on each other matter. With respect to the election
of each of the eight Director nominees, you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN. To be elected, Directors must receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to such Director
( e.g., the number of shares voted FOR a Director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted AGAINST that nominee). Under the Company's
Corporate Governance Principles, each Director nominee submits, in advance of the Annual Meeting, an irrevocable resignation that will become effective if (i) a majority of the votes cast in
the election are voted AGAINST the Director nominee and (ii) the Board accepts the tendered resignation. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board (the "Nominating and Governance
Committee") considers any tendered resignation and makes a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation, or to take other action. The Board will consider and act on
the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation within 90 days from the date that the election results are certified and will disclose its action publicly within four business days of
its decision. With
respect to the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and the advisory resolution to
approve the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers (who are identified below in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis"), you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN with respect to each
proposal. In order to be approved, each of these proposals requires the affirmative FOR vote of a majority in voting power of the shares of Common Stock which are present in person or represented by
proxy and which are entitled to vote on the proposal. Any ABSTAIN vote will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the matter. If
your shares of Common Stock are held in "street name" ( i.e. , held for your benefit through a broker, bank, or other nominee), you have
the right to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote the shares in your account. Please contact your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a voting
information form for you to use to direct how your shares should be voted. If you are a "street name" stockholder, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting
unless you obtain a legal proxy from the bank, broker or other nominee that holds your shares of Common Stock, giving you the right to vote the shares instead of the bank, broker or other nominee
holding your shares. A broker or nominee is entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial holder on routine matters, such as the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as
the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, without instructions from the beneficial holder of those shares. On the other hand, absent instructions 2 Table of Contents from
the beneficial holder of such shares, a broker or nominee is not entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial holder on non-routine items considered at the Annual Meeting, such as the election
of Directors and the advisory resolution to approve the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers. Consequently, if you do not give your broker specific instructions, your shares may not
be voted on the non-routine matters and will not be counted in determining the number of shares necessary for approval. However, abstentions and broker non-votes
( i.e ., when a stockholder does not provide voting instructions to their broker or nominee) will count for purposes of determining whether a quorum
exists. Please instruct your broker or nominee so your vote can be counted on all proposals. Stockholders Sharing the Same Last Name and Address To reduce the expense of delivering duplicate proxy materials to stockholders who may have more than one account holding Common Stock
but who share the same address, the Company has adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, certain stockholders of record who have the same address and last
name, and who do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials, will receive only one copy of the Notice and the Proxy Materials that are delivered until such time as one or more of these
stockholders notifies the Company otherwise. Stockholders
who receive a single set of Proxy Materials as a result of householding and wish to have separate copies of the Notice or the Proxy Materials may submit a request to:
Investor Relations, c/o SanDisk Corporation, 951 SanDisk Drive, Milpitas, CA 95035, or call the Company's Investor Relations department at (408) 801-1000, and the Company will promptly
comply with such request. Stockholders may contact the Company's Investor Relations representative at the phone number above if it receives multiple copies of the Proxy Materials and would prefer to
receive a single copy in the future. Revocability of Proxies Any person giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before the close of voting. Stockholders of record may revoke their
proxy by filing with the Secretary of the Company an instrument of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. If your shares of
Common Stock are held in "street name" ( i.e. , held for your benefit through a broker, bank, or other nominee), contact your broker or nominee for
specific instructions on revoking your vote. Solicitation of Proxies The Board is soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting. The Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Copies of solicitation
materials will be furnished to brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians holding shares in their names that are beneficially owned by others to forward to such beneficial owners who have requested
to receive paper copies. The Company may reimburse such persons for the costs they incur to forward the solicitation material to such beneficial owners. The original solicitation of proxies may be
supplemented by solicitation by telephone, facsimile or other means by Directors, officers or employees of the Company. No additional compensation will be paid to these individuals for these services.
The Company may enlist the help of banks and brokerage firms in soliciting proxies from their customers and reimburse the banks and brokerage firms for related out-of-pocket expenses. 3 Table of Contents Annual Meeting Admission All stockholders entitled to vote as of the Record Date are entitled to attend the Annual Meeting. Such individuals should be prepared
to present government-issued photo identification, such as a valid driver's license or passport, and verification of ownership of Common Stock or proxy status as of the Record Date for admittance. For
stockholders of record as of the Record Date, proof of ownership as of the Record Date may be verified prior to admittance into the Annual Meeting. For stockholders who were not stockholders of record
but held shares through a bank, broker or other nominee holder as of the Record Date, proof of beneficial ownership as of the Record Date, such as an account statement or similar evidence of
ownership, may be verified prior to admittance into the Annual Meeting. For proxy holders, proof of valid proxy status may be verified prior to admittance into the Annual Meeting. Stockholders and
proxy holders will be admitted to the Annual Meeting if they comply with these procedures. Stockholder Proposals and Nominations to be Presented at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders Proposals of stockholders of the Company that are intended to be presented by such stockholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders must be received by the Company no later than December 29, 2015 in order that they may be considered for inclusion in the Company's Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to
that meeting. All such proposals must comply with Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which lists the requirements for the inclusion of
stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials. If the stockholder proposal is to be presented at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders but is not to be included in the Company's Proxy
Statement, including any stockholder-recommended Director nomination, the notice of proposal or nomination, as applicable, must be received no earlier than January 20, 2016 and no later than
February 19, 2016 and with such information required by the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws"). Further information regarding stockholder submission of Director nominations is
provided below in "Consideration of Director Nominees—Stockholder-Recommended Nominees." 4 Table of Contents PROPOSAL NO. 1 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS The Board currently consists of eight members. All current Directors have been recommended for nomination by the Nominating and
Governance Committee, have been nominated by the Board for re-election and are standing for re-election. Each of the eight nominees were elected to the Board by the stockholders at the 2014 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders. The Board has determined that each of the nominees listed below, other than Mr. Mehrotra and Dr. Hu, is independent as defined under SEC rules and the listing
standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market ("NASDAQ"). The Board determined that Dr. Hu is not independent because, as discussed below in "Certain Transactions and Relationships,"
Dr. Hu entered into Consulting Services Agreements with the Company in October 2013, January 2014 and May 2014. There are no family relationships between any executive officer, as defined in
Rule 3b-7 (an "executive officer") of the Exchange Act, and any Director nominee. Directors elected to the Board will serve for the ensuing year and until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified. In the event that any Director nominee is
unavailable to serve, which is not anticipated, the proxies will be voted for any nominee who is designated by the current Board to fill the resulting vacancy. Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy
holders will vote the proxies received by them "FOR" each of the eight nominees named below. In accordance with the procedures described above under "Voting Rights," a Director nominee must receive a
majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election to the Board. The proxies solicited by this Proxy Statement may not be voted for more than eight nominees. Set
forth below is additional information as of March 2, 2015 regarding the nominees to the Board. Name Position(s) with the Company Age First Elected/Appointed as a Director Michael E.

Board Governance Corporate Governance Principles and Committee Charters The Board has adopted a set of Corporate Governance Principles, which address important governance policies that assist the Board in
following corporate practices that serve the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, including establishing the Board's procedures for reviewing resignations submitted pursuant to the
Company's majority voting standard. Stockholders can access the Corporate Governance Principles by clicking on "Corporate Governance" at www.sandisk.com/IR. The Company will also provide copies of the
Corporate Governance Principles free of charge to any stockholder who sends a written request to: Investor Relations, c/o SanDisk Corporation, 951 SanDisk Drive, Milpitas, CA 95035. The
Board currently has three standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee. The charters for the Audit Committee, the
Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Governance Committee are available by clicking on "Corporate Governance" at www.sandisk.com/IR. The Company will also provide copies of any charter free
of charge to any stockholder who sends a written request to: Investor Relations, c/o SanDisk Corporation, 951 SanDisk Drive, Milpitas, CA 95035. Communications with the Board The Company encourages stockholder communications with its Board and has adopted a policy governing such communications. Under this
policy, individuals may communicate with the Board by sending an email to the Board's attention at: BOD@sandisk.com, or by writing to: Board of Directors, c/o Investor Relations, SanDisk Corporation,
951 SanDisk Drive, Milpitas, CA 95035. Communications that are intended specifically for non-management Directors should be sent to the attention of the Chair of the Nominating and Governance
Committee. The Company will deliver correspondence to the Board unless the communication is unrelated to the Board's duties, such as spam, junk mail, advertisements, mass mailings, solicitations, job
inquiries or the communication is otherwise irrelevant. 10 Table of Contents Board Meetings and Attendance The Board held seven meetings during fiscal year 2014. During fiscal year 2014, each member of the Board attended or participated in
75% or more of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the Board held during the period for which such person has been a Director and (ii) the total number of meetings held
by all committees of the Board on which such person served during the period for which such Director served on the Board. The Company encourages each incumbent Director and each nominee to the Board
to attend its Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All of the Director nominees attended that meeting. Audit Committee The Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") held ten meetings during fiscal year 2014. The Audit Committee, which during
fiscal year 2014 consisted of Ms. Lego (Chair), Mr. Federman, Mr. Gomo and Mr. Mercer, oversees on behalf of the Board the integrity of the Company's financial statements
and the appointment, compensation, qualifications, independence and performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements and the performance of the Company's internal accounting, audit and financial controls. As part of its oversight and review of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm,
the Audit Committee reviews, on an annual basis, the qualifications, independence and performance of the Company's audit engagement team, and monitors the rotation and selection of the
partner-in-charge on the Company's audit engagement team as required by law (including providing input and guidance on which partner to select), which occurs once every five years. In connection with
monitoring the rotation and selection of the partner-in-charge on the Company's audit engagement team, which rotation is set to occur after the completion of the fiscal year 2015 audit, the Audit
Committee will review the performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm beginning in 2015. The
Audit Committee also regularly reviews the Company's enterprise risk assessment and mitigation processes and assists the Board with its oversight and annual review of the Company's
enterprise risk management. The Audit Committee is authorized to conduct investigations, and to retain, at the expense of the Company, independent legal, accounting or other professional consultants
selected by the Audit Committee, for any matters relating to its purposes. The Board adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which was last reviewed and approved in March 2015. The Board
has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC. The Board has also determined that each member of the Audit Committee is an
"independent director" as defined by NASDAQ listing standards and also meets the additional criteria for independence of Audit Committee members set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange
Act. Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") held eleven meetings during fiscal year 2014. The Compensation
Committee during fiscal year 2014 consisted of Mr. Federman (Chair), Mr. Gomo, Mr. DeNuccio (through February 3, 2014), and, as of February 10, 2014 and
December 12, 2014, Mr. Mercer and Mr. Hartenstein, respectively. The Compensation Committee has authority for establishing the general compensation policies of the Company,
reviewing and setting the compensation of the Company's executive officers, as defined by NASDAQ listing standards and Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act (the "Section 16 Officers"),
evaluating the performance of the Company's Section 16 Officers, administering the Company's incentive and employee stock purchase plans, including the review and grant of incentive awards to
the Company's
Section 16 Officers, and recommending to the Board appropriate compensation programs for non-employee directors of the Company (including any equity award policies for non-employee directors).
The Board adopted a charter 11 Table of Contents for
the Compensation Committee, which was last reviewed and approved in March 2015. The charter requires, in part, that the Compensation Committee consist of no fewer than three Directors who satisfy
the independence requirements of NASDAQ and applicable law. The Board has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee satisfies such independence requirements. While
the Compensation Committee has primary authority for the administration of the Company's incentive plans for the Company's Section 16 Officers, the Board has delegated
concurrent authority to the Compensation Committee and a committee that may consist of one or more Directors (the "Secondary Board Committee") as well as a committee that may consist of one or more
executive officers of the Company (the "Secondary Executive Committee") for certain other types of share-based awards. The Secondary Board Committee may only grant share-based awards (including stock
options and restricted stock units ("RSUs")) to employees who are not Section 16 Officers. In fiscal year 2014, the Secondary Board Committee consisted of Mr. Mehrotra. The Secondary
Executive Committee may only grant stock options (but not RSUs or other share-based awards) to employees who are not Section 16 Officers. In fiscal year 2014, the Secondary Executive Committee
consisted of Judy Bruner, the Company's Executive Vice President, Administration and Chief Financial Officer and Donald Robertson, the Company's Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer.
Share-based awards to the Section 16 Officers are made exclusively by the Compensation Committee, and share-based awards to non-employee directors of the Company are recommended by the
Compensation Committee to the Board for approval. Processes and Procedures. For information on the responsibilities and activities of the Compensation Committee, including the
processes and
procedures for the consideration and determination of Director and executive compensation, see "Director Compensation" and "Executive Compensation-Compensation Discussion and Analysis." Independent Compensation Consultant. Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee has the power, in its discretion, to
retain at the expense
of the Company, independent counsel and other advisors as it deems necessary or appropriate to assist the Compensation Committee in carrying out its duties. Under its charter, the Compensation
Committee has the express authority to decide whether to retain a compensation consultant to assist in the evaluation of the Company's compensation programs. If the Compensation Committee decides, in
its discretion, to retain a compensation consultant, the
Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate such consultant engaged to assist in the evaluation of the compensation of the Company's Section 16 Officers (including all
of the Named Executive Officers, who are identified below in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis"). In fiscal year 2014, the Compensation Committee retained Farient Advisors ("Farient"), an outside
compensation consultant, to assist in analyzing the Company's peer companies for fiscal year 2015 compensation, and to provide information on compensation-related trends and developments in the
Company's industry and fiscal year 2015 peer companies, including equity award practices. Compensia, Inc. ("Compensia"), an outside compensation consultant that the Company had previously
engaged, evaluated the competitiveness of the Company's executive compensation programs relative to the Company's fiscal year 2014 peer companies and provided information on compensation-related
trends and developments in the Company's industry and fiscal year 2014 peer companies, including equity award practices. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation. The Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2014 consisted of
Mr. Federman
(Chair), Mr. Gomo, Mr. DeNuccio (through February 3, 2014), and, as of February 10, 2014 and December 12, 2014, Mr. Mercer and Mr. Hartenstein,
respectively. In fiscal year 2014, no member of the Compensation Committee was a current or former executive officer or employee of the Company. See "Certain Transactions and Relationships" for a
description of a transaction occurring during fiscal year 2014 involving Mr. Federman and transactions occurring during fiscal year 2014 involving Dr. Hu, each of which requires
disclosure by the Company under the SEC's rules requiring disclosure of certain relationships and related-party transactions. None of the Company's executive officers 12 Table of Contents served
as a director or a member of a compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, the executive officers of which served as a Director or member of
the Compensation Committee during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014. Analysis of Risk in Compensation Programs. In setting compensation, the Compensation Committee also considers the risks to the
Company's
stockholders, and the Company as a whole, arising out of the Company's compensation programs. In March 2015, the Company's management met to discuss and assess the risk profile of the Company's
compensation programs. Their review considered risk-influencing characteristics of the overall structure and individual components of the Company's compensation program, including the Company's base
salaries, incentive plans and equity plans. A report regarding management's findings was provided to the Compensation Committee for its review and consideration. Following this review and
consideration, the Compensation Committee concurred with management's conclusions that the Company's compensation policies were not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company
and included many features that mitigate the likelihood of excessive risk-taking, including those discussed below. Balance of Compensation. Individual elements of the Company's compensation program include base salaries, incentive compensation, and
for certain of
its employees, share-based awards. By providing a mix of different elements of compensation that reward both short-term and long-term performance, the Company's compensation programs as a whole
provide a balanced approach to incentivizing and retaining employees, without placing an inappropriate emphasis on any particular form of compensation. Company Results and Pre-established Performance Measures Dictate Annual Incentives. Under the Company's cash-based incentive plan,
payments are
subject to the satisfaction of specific annual performance objectives established by the Compensation Committee in advance and may be subject to reimbursement or forfeiture under the Company's
clawback policy. These performance objectives were directly and specifically tied to the Company's fiscal year 2014 diluted non-GAAP earnings per share, as well as the achievement of strategic
objectives for fiscal year 2014. Use of Long-Term Incentive Compensation. Share-based long-term incentive compensation that vests over a period of years is a key
component of the
total compensation of many of the Company's employees. This vesting period encourages the Company's executives and other employees to focus on sustaining and improving the Company's long-term
performance. These grants are generally made annually, so executives and other key employees always have unvested awards that could decrease significantly in value if the Company's business is not
managed for the long term. Internal Processes Further Restrict Risk. The Company has in place additional processes to limit risk to the Company from its
compensation programs.
Specifically, sales commission payments are subject to multiple internal controls regarding payout terms and payroll programs. Additionally, financial results upon which incentive compensation
payments are based are subject to regular review and audit. In addition, the Company from time to time engages an external compensation consulting firm to assist in the design and review of the
Company's compensation programs, as well as external legal counsel to assist with the periodic review of the Company's compensation plans to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Nominating and Governance Committee The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board held three meetings during fiscal year 2014. During fiscal year 2014, the
Nominating and Governance Committee consisted of Mr. Marks (Chair), Mr. Hartenstein, and Mr. DeNuccio (through February 3, 2014). The Nominating and Governance Committee
identifies, considers and recommends Director nominees to be selected by the 13 Table of Contents Board
for submission to vote at the Company's annual stockholder meetings and to fill vacancies occurring between annual stockholder meetings, implements the Board's criteria for selecting new
Directors, develops or reviews and recommends corporate governance policies for the Board, and oversees the annual board and committee evaluation process. The Nominating and Governance Committee is
also authorized to conduct investigations and to retain, at the expense of the Company, independent legal, accounting, financial, governance or other professional consultants selected by the
Nominating and Governance Committee, for any matters relating to its purposes. The Board adopted a charter for the Nominating and Governance Committee, which was last reviewed and approved in March
2015. The Board has determined that each of the members of the Nominating and Governance Committee is an "independent director" as defined by NASDAQ listing standards. Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight Board Leadership Structure Mr. Marks has served as the Chairman of the Board since January 1, 2011. Mr. Mehrotra has served as Chief
Executive Officer of the Company since January 1, 2011 and as a Director since July 2010. The Board believes that it is in the Company's best interests to maintain a separation of the Chairman
of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer roles because it allows the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company to focus on the Company's day-to-day business, while allowing the Chairman of the Board to lead the Board in its fundamental role of providing advice to and
independent oversight of management. Each
of the current Directors, other than Mr. Mehrotra and Dr. Hu, is independent and the independent Directors have regular executive sessions. Following an executive
session of independent Directors, one or more of the attending Directors may: (1) act as a liaison between the independent Directors and management regarding any specific feedback or issues;
(2) provide management with input regarding agenda items for Board and Committee meetings; and (3) coordinate with management regarding information to be provided to the independent
Directors in performing their duties. The Board believes that this approach appropriately and effectively complements the Company's current leadership structure. Under
its charter, the Nominating and Governance Committee periodically reviews the performance of the Board and its Committees, including the functionality and effectiveness of the
Board's leadership structure. Board Role in Risk Oversight The Board is actively involved in the oversight of risks that could affect the Company. This oversight is conducted at the Board level
and, where relevant to a committee's duties, through the committees of the Board. While the Board and its committees oversee risk management strategy, management is responsible for implementing and
supervising day-to-day risk management processes. In addition, the Audit Committee regularly reviews the Company's enterprise risk assessment and mitigation processes and assists the Board with its
oversight and annual review of the Company's enterprise risk management. The Company believes this division of risk management responsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks
that the Company faces. 14 Table of Contents Consideration of Director Nominees Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Directors The Nominating and Governance Committee initiates the director nomination process by preparing a slate of potential candidates who,
based on their qualifications and other information available to the Nominating and Governance Committee, appear to meet the criteria
specified below and/or who have specific desirable qualities, skills or experience (based on input from the full Board). The Nominating and Governance Committee may engage a third-party search firm or
other advisors to assist in identifying prospective nominees. The nomination of existing Directors is not automatic, but is based on continuing qualification under the criteria set forth below and the
Corporate Governance Principles of the Company. Under the Company's Corporate Governance Principles, at all times, a majority of the individuals serving as Directors must be "independent" under
applicable SEC and stock exchange rules. After
the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews a nominee's qualifications and characteristics, a new candidate will be interviewed by at least one member of the Nominating and
Governance Committee and by the Chief Executive Officer. Upon completion of the evaluation process, the Nominating and Governance Committee determines the list of potential candidates to be
recommended to the full Board for nomination at the annual meeting or to fill any vacancy on the Board. The Board will select the slate of nominees, including any nominee to fill a vacancy, only from
candidates screened and approved by the Nominating and Governance Committee. Stockholder-Recommended Nominees The Nominating and Governance Committee considers recommendations for Director nominees that are properly submitted by stockholders. In
evaluating a recommended nominee ("Recommended Candidate"), the Nominating and Governance Committee seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board and considers the
membership criteria set forth under "Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Directors" and "Director Qualifications." In
order to be submitted properly, recommendations of a Recommended Candidate must be timely delivered to: Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee, c/o SanDisk Corporation, 951
SanDisk Drive, Milpitas, CA 95035. The recommendation must include the following written materials: (1) all information relating to the Recommended Candidate that is required to be disclosed
pursuant to applicable Exchange Act rules and regulations, NASDAQ listing standards and the Company's Bylaws (including, with respect to the Recommended Candidate, such person's written consent to
being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and, such person's written consent to serving as a Director if elected); (2) the name(s) and address(es) of the recommending stockholder(s) and
the amount of the Company's securities owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder(s); (3) appropriate biographical information (including a business address and a telephone number)
and a statement as to the Recommended Candidate's qualifications, with a focus on the criteria described below under "Director Qualifications;" (4) a representation that each recommending
stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote on the date of submission of such written materials; and (5) any material interest of the recommending stockholder in
the recommended nomination. If
the Recommended Candidate is intended to be considered by the Nominating and Governance Committee for recommendation to the Board for the slate of Director nominees to be voted on at
an
annual meeting of the Company's stockholders, the written materials must be submitted within the time permitted for submission of a stockholder proposal for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement
for the subject annual meeting and must also comply with Exchange Act rules and regulations, NASDAQ listing standards, and the provisions for stockholder proposals set forth in the Company's Bylaws. 15 Table of Contents Director Qualifications The Nominating and Governance Committee has established the following minimum criteria for evaluating prospective Board

Other Factors for Potential Consideration. The Nominating and Governance Committee will also consider the following factors in
connection with its
evaluation of each prospective nominee: • Whether the prospective nominee will contribute to the Board's overall diversity of backgrounds, skills, perspectives and experiences; • Whether the nominee possesses the requisite education, training and experience to qualify as "financially literate" or as an "audit
committee financial expert" under applicable SEC and stock exchange rules; • The composition of the Board and whether the prospective nominee will add to or complement the Board's existing strengths; • For incumbent Directors standing for re-election, the incumbent Director's performance during his or her term, including the number of

The Compensation Committee, consisting solely of independent directors, has the primary responsibility for reviewing and considering any revisions to Non-Employee Director compensation, and
recommending any such revisions to the Board for review. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews Non-Employee Director compensation. In such review, the Compensation Committee may review and
consider data regarding the competitiveness of the Company's Non-Employee Director compensation program relative to the Company's peer companies and general industry trends, which data may be compiled
by the Company's management and/or with the assistance of a compensation consultant. The Board reviews the Compensation Committee's recommendations and determines the amount of director compensation. Annual Retainers The Company policy regarding Non-Employee Director compensation in place during fiscal year 2014 was as follows: Type of Fee Fiscal Year 2014 Annual Board Retainer $ 60,000 Additional Annual Retainer to Chairman of the Board $ 75,000 Additional Annual Retainer to Chair of Audit Committee $ 30,000 Additional Annual Retainer to Chairs of Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee $ 15,000 Additional Annual Retainer to non-Chair Members of Audit Committee $ 20,000 Additional Annual Retainer to non-Chair Members of Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee $ 7,500 18 Table of Contents All
Non-Employee Directors are also reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses they incur serving as Directors and as committee members. Share-Based Awards Under the Company's Non-Employee Director compensation policy, as currently in effect, a Non-Employee Director who first takes office
and who has not been employed by the Company in the preceding twelve (12) months receives (i) an initial option grant (the "Initial Option Grant") to purchase that number of shares of
Common Stock that results from multiplying the shares subject to the Annual Option (as defined below) by the Initial Service Term (as defined below) and (ii) an initial RSU grant for a number
of units determined by multiplying the shares subject to the Annual RSU (as defined below) by the Initial Service Term (the "Initial Unit Grant"). The "Initial Service Term" means a fraction with the
numerator being the number of days from the date of appointment to the Board until the next scheduled Annual Meeting of Stockholders or, if no Annual Meeting of Stockholders has been scheduled, the
one-year anniversary of the previous Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and the denominator being 365. In addition, on the date of each Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each Non-Employee Director who has
been elected or re-elected at such Annual Meeting of Stockholders also receives (i) the Annual Option Grant, and (ii) an RSU grant for a number of units determined by dividing $125,000
by the average closing price per share of Common Stock on NASDAQ for the five (5) trading days ended on, and including, the grant date (the "Annual Unit Grant"). The initial and annual awards
described in this paragraph are granted under, and are subject to, the Company's 2013 Incentive Plan (the "2013 Plan"). Initial and Annual Stock Option Grants. The Initial and Annual Option Grants are granted with a per share exercise price equal
to the fair market
value of a share of Common Stock on the grant date. For these purposes, and in accordance with the terms of the 2013 Plan and the Company's share-based award grant practices, the fair market value is
equal to the closing price of a share of the Common Stock on NASDAQ on the grant date. The
stock options granted to Non-Employee Directors are immediately exercisable. However, upon a Non-Employee Director's cessation of service with the Company, any shares purchased upon
exercise of the option that have not vested (as described below) are subject to repurchase by the Company at the lower of (i) the exercise price paid for the shares or (ii) the fair
market value of the shares at the time of repurchase (as determined under the 2013 Plan). This type of stock option is generally referred to as an "early exercise" stock option because the holder is
permitted to exercise the option prior to the time that the underlying shares vest. Subject to the Non-Employee Director's continued service, the shares subject to the Initial Option Grant and the
Annual Option Grant vest, and the Company's repurchase right lapses, in one installment on the earlier of (i) first anniversary of the grant date or (ii) the day immediately preceding
the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the grant date. Once
vested, each option will generally remain exercisable for fully vested shares of Common Stock ( i.e. , shares which are not subject to
the Company's repurchase right) until its normal expiration date. Each of the options granted to the Company's Non-Employee Directors, under the 2013 Plan, has a term of seven (7) years.
However, vested stock options may terminate earlier in connection with a
change in control of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the 2013 Plan, stock options granted to the Company's Non-Employee Directors will vest on an accelerated basis in connection with a change in
control of the Company. Shares subject to the option that have not vested will immediately terminate (or be subject to the Company's repurchase right to the extent already purchased under the option)
upon the cessation of the Non-Employee Director's service. However, the shares subject to options vest, and the Company's repurchase right lapses, in full if the Non-Employee Director's cessation of
service is as a result of the Director's death or permanent disability. Non-Employee Directors generally have twelve (12) months to exercise the vested portion of the option following a
cessation of service. 19 Table of Contents The
options granted to Non-Employee Directors do not include any dividend or dividend equivalent rights. However, Non-Employee Directors are entitled to dividends with respect to shares
purchased upon the exercise of options, whether or not such shares have vested under the option, at the same rate as the Company's other stockholders. Initial and Annual RSU Grants. Each RSU awarded to the Company's Non-Employee Directors represents a contractual right to receive
one share of the
Common Stock if the time-based vesting requirements described below are satisfied. Subject
to the Non-Employee Director's continued service, the units subject to the Initial Unit Grant and the Annual Unit Grant vest in one installment on the earlier of (i) the
first anniversary of the grant date or (ii) the day immediately preceding the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the grant date. Pursuant to the terms of the 2013 Plan, RSUs granted
to the Company's Non-Employee Directors will vest on an accelerated basis in connection with a change in control of the Company. Upon the cessation of the Non-Employee Director's service, any unvested
RSUs will generally terminate. However, RSUs granted to a Non-Employee Director vest in full if the Non-Employee Director's cessation of service is as a result of the Director's death or permanent
disability. RSUs
will generally be paid in an equivalent number of shares of the Common Stock as they vest. Non-Employee Directors are not entitled to voting or dividend rights with respect to the
RSUs, and the RSUs generally may not be transferred, except to the Company or to a beneficiary of the Non-Employee Director upon his or her death. However, non-Employee Directors are entitled to the
following dividend equivalent rights with respect to the RSUs. If the Company pays a cash dividend on its Common Stock and the dividend record date occurs after the grant date and before all of the
RSUs have either been paid or terminated, then the Company will credit the Non-Employee Director's bookkeeping account with an amount equal to (i) the per-share cash dividend paid by the
Company on its Common Stock with respect to the dividend record date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of outstanding and unpaid RSUs (including any unvested RSUs) as of the dividend record
date. These
dividend equivalents will be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms and conditions as the original RSUs to which they relate (except that the dividend equivalents may be paid in cash or
such other form as the plan administrator may deem appropriate). The
Board administers the 2013 Plan as to Non-Employee Director awards and has the ability to interpret and make all required determinations under the plan, subject to plan limits. This
authority includes making required proportionate adjustments to outstanding awards to reflect any impact resulting from various corporate events such as reorganizations, mergers and stock splits. Required Vote The required vote for the election of each Director is as described above under "Voting Rights." Recommendation of the Board of Directors The Board believes that Proposal No. 1 is in the Company's best interests and the best interests of its
stockholders' and unanimously recommends a vote FOR the election of each of the Director nominees. 20 Table of Contents PROPOSAL NO. 2 RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for

Scott Mercer 23 Table of Contents PROPOSAL NO. 3 ADVISORY RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF SANDISK CORPORATION At the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company's stockholders voted in favor of holding an advisory vote to approve
the compensation of the Company's named executive officers every year. The Board considered the voting results on that proposal and determined to adopt a policy providing for an annual advisory
stockholder vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. In
accordance with that policy and pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Company is asking stockholders to pass an advisory resolution commonly known as a "say-on-pay"
proposal to approve the Company's compensation of its Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2014 (who are identified below
in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis") as reported in this Proxy Statement. As described below in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" of this Proxy Statement, the Compensation Committee
has designed the Company's compensation of its Named Executive Officers to align each Named Executive Officer's compensation with the Company's near-, medium- and long-term performance and to provide
the compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate and retain the executive officers who are crucial to the Company's long-term success. You are urged to read the "Compensation Discussion and
Analysis," which describes in more detail the Company's executive compensation policies, particularly as they relate to the Named Executive Officers, as well as the Summary Compensation Table and
other related compensation tables and narrative, which provide detailed information on the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers. The
advisory resolution gives stockholders the opportunity to express their approval of the Company's Named Executive Officer compensation program. This vote is not intended to address
any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement.
Accordingly, you are being asked to vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: "RESOLVED,
that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2015
Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation
Table and the other related tables and disclosure." The
say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions
of the Company's stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the "say-on-pay" proposal, the Compensation Committee will consider the Company's stockholders' concerns and will
evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. Unless
the Board modifies its policy on the frequency of say-on-pay votes, the next say-on-pay vote will be held at the Company's 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Recommendation of the Board of Directors The Board believes that approval of Proposal No. 3 is in the Company's best interests and the best
interests of its stockholders and unanimously recommends a vote FOR the advisory resolution to approve the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this Proxy
Statement. 24 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS This section contains a discussion of the material elements of compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to the following executive
officers of the Company: the principal executive officer; the principal financial officer; and the three other most highly compensated individuals who were serving as executive officers as of the last
day of fiscal year 2014. These individuals are referred to as the "Named Executive Officers" in this Proxy Statement and include: • Sanjay Mehrotra—President and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer); • Judy Bruner—Executive Vice President, Administration and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer); • Sumit Sadana—Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy Officer and, since April 2015, General Manager, Enterprise
Solutions; • Mark Brazeal—Chief Legal Officer and Senior Vice President, IP Licensing; and • Shuki Nir—Senior Vice President, Corporate Marketing, and General Manager, Retail. The
Company's current executive compensation programs are determined and approved by the Compensation Committee. None of the Named Executive Officers is a member of the Compensation
Committee. Executive Summary Business Overview and Performance. SanDisk is a global leader in flash storage solutions with a strong history of innovative
products. Flash storage
technology allows digital information to be stored in a durable, compact format that retains the data even without power. The Company's flash-based products enable businesses and consumers to
efficiently and effectively capture, share and preserve digital content. The Company's products include flash storage solutions for enterprise data centers and client
computing platforms, as well as removable and embedded flash products for mobile devices, cameras, automotive, connected home electronics and other applications. The Company's products are used in a
variety of large markets, and the Company distributes its products globally through commercial and retail channels. Fiscal Year 2014 Business Highlights. • Achieved record revenue of $6.63 billion, up 7% compared to fiscal year 2013. • Delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 28%, resulting in record diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis of $5.60 per share, up
5% from the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal year 2013. • Generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion, and returned 103% of free cash flow to stockholders through $1.3 billion of
stock repurchases and $234 million of dividends. • Increased sales of solid state drive ("SSD") solutions by 61% on a year-over-year basis, with SSD solutions revenue representing 29%
of fiscal year 2014 revenue, up from 19% of fiscal year 2013 revenue. 25 Table of Contents • Completed the strategic acquisition of Fusion-io, a leading developer of flash-based PCIe hardware and software solutions, enhancing
the Company's portfolio addressing enterprise and hyperscale data centers. • Began the volume ramp of the Company's 15-nanometer memory technology, the industry's most advanced NAND flash manufacturing node. Non-GAAP
operating margin differs from what is reported under GAAP. See Annex A for information on the rationale for the use of non-GAAP financial measures and for a
reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the Company's results as reported under GAAP. The
Company measures free cash flow as cash flow from operations less investments in property and equipment and net cash flows related to investments in, and loans to, the Company's
manufacturing ventures with Toshiba. The
Company uses non-GAAP measures to establish financial and strategic goals and to measure performance for executive officer compensation because the Company believes that non-GAAP
measures allow management to better evaluate the core operating performance of the Company especially when comparing to the results of previous periods and to the Company's business model objectives.
For reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial
Measures," of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014. Fiscal Year 2014 Named Executive Officer Compensation Highlights. During fiscal year 2014, a significant percentage of each
Named Executive Officer's
total compensation (as reported in the Summary Compensation Table) was at-risk, having included (1) annual performance-based cash bonus opportunities, which become payable only upon the
achievement of certain financial and strategic objectives established by the Compensation Committee, which advance the Company's near-, medium-and long-term business objectives and are designed to
create sustainable long-term stockholder value, (2) RSUs, the value of which is directly tied to the value of the Company's Common Stock over time, and (3) stock options, with exercise
prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the grant date, which become valuable only upon realized share appreciation after the grant date. Information regarding the
compensation mix for the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the other Named Executive Officers, as a group, for fiscal year 2014 is set forth below. 26 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2014 Named Executive Officer Compensation Mix. (1) (1) Excludes
amounts reflected in the "All Other Compensation" column of the table labeled "Summary Compensation Table—Fiscal Years
2012-2014" below. (2) Excludes
Mr. Mehrotra, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Brazeal, who was hired in December 2014. (3) Consists
of amounts reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column for fiscal year 2014 in the table labeled "Summary
Compensation Table—Fiscal Years 2012-2014" below. (4) Consists
of amounts reflected in the "Stock Awards" and "Option Awards" columns for fiscal year 2014 in the table labeled "Summary
Compensation Table—Fiscal Years 2012-2014" below. A
meaningful portion of the compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2014, with the exception of Mr. Brazeal who was hired in December 2014, was
based on a performance-based cash incentive program (the "2014 bonus program"), which is tied to the achievement of certain financial and strategic objectives established by the Compensation Committee
at the beginning of the year. The financial objective for the 2014 bonus program was tied to the Company's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ("EPS"). The Company's EPS for fiscal year 2014 was $5.60
per share, which was below the EPS target that drove the financial objectives portion of the 2014 bonus program, but was above the minimum EPS target whereby bonus payouts are made. In aggregate, the
Company exceeded the target performance for its strategic objectives. Consistent
with the Company's compensation philosophy described in more detail below, equity awards increase each Named Executive Officer's stake in the Company, thereby reinforcing the
incentive to manage the Company's business as owners and subjecting a significant portion of the executive officer's total compensation to fluctuations in the market price of Common Stock. Executive Compensation Program Overview Executive Compensation Philosophy. SanDisk has a long-standing commitment to a compensation program guided by three basic
philosophies:
(1) alignment of compensation with stockholder interests, (2) pay-for-performance, and (3) compensation opportunities that are competitive so that the Company can attract, retain
and motivate top-tier talent. The Compensation Committee sets a significant portion of the compensation of the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, based on their ability to
achieve annual financial and strategic objectives that advance the Company's long-term business objectives and that are designed to create sustainable long-term stockholder value. 27 Table of Contents Elements of Compensation Program. As described in more detail below, the material elements of the Company's current executive
compensation program
for the executive officers include the following: a base salary, an annual cash bonus opportunity, a long-term share-based incentive opportunity, 401(k) retirement benefits and severance protection
for certain terminations of employment. These individual compensation elements are intended to create a total compensation package for the executive officers that the Company believes achieves its
compensation objectives and provides competitive compensation opportunities. Furthermore, with the exception of the severance protection, the elements of the executive officers' compensation are the
same as those of the Company's broader employee population, which the Company believes also aligns the interests of the executive officers with the Company as a whole. Objectives of Compensation Program The table below lists each material element of the Company's executive compensation program and the
compensation
objectives that it is designed to achieve: Compensation Element Compensation Objectives Designed to be Achieved Base Salary • Attract and retain top-tier talent Annual Cash Bonus Opportunity • Pay-for-performance • Align executive officers' interests with those of stockholders • Attract, retain and motivate top-tier
talent Long-term Share-Based Incentives • Pay-for-performance • Align executive officers' interests with those of stockholders • Attract, retain and motivate top-tier
talent 401(k) Retirement Benefits • Attract and retain top-tier talent Severance and Other Benefits Upon Termination of Employment in Certain Circumstances • Attract and retain top-tier talent The
material elements described above include both fixed amounts and variable amounts, which serve distinct purposes. The Company believes that in order to attract and retain top-caliber
executive officers, it needs to provide them with fixed, predictable benefit amounts that reward their continued service, and the Company provides its executive officers with base salaries, 401(k)
retirement benefits and severance and other termination benefits, which are generally fixed or predictable. The
variable elements, including the Company's annual bonus opportunity, are primarily intended to hold the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, accountable for
their performance, although the Company believes the bonus also aligns the interests of the executive officers with those of the Company's stockholders and helps the Company attract, retain and
motivate the executive officers. The Company's long-term share-based incentives are primarily intended to align the interests of the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, with
those of the Company's stockholders, although the Company believes the share-based incentives also help hold executive officers accountable for their performance and help the Company attract, retain
and motivate executive officers. The annual bonus opportunity and the long-term share-based incentives are designed to reward performance and the creation of stockholder value, and therefore the value
of these benefits is dependent on performance. The annual bonus opportunity is paid out on an annual basis to the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, and is designed to reward
performance for that period. The long-term equity incentives are generally designed to reward performance over one or more years. Continued Commitment to Good Compensation Governance. The Company endeavors to maintain good governance standards with respect
to its executive
compensation program. The Company has instituted the 28 Table of Contents following
policies, which remained in effect in fiscal year 2014, to ensure that its executive compensation program is consistent with good governance
standards: • In general, the executive officers are not entitled to guaranteed, non-performance based bonuses or salary increases. • The executive officers are not entitled to tax reimbursement or tax gross-up payments in respect of perquisites or other compensation. • The Company maintains a clawback policy pursuant to which each Section 16 Officer, including each Named Executive Officer, may
be required to reimburse or forfeit all or a portion of any cash-based incentive compensation received if the Company's financial statements are required to be restated as a result of material
non-compliance with any financial reporting requirements. • To align the interests of the Company's executive officers with the interests of the Company's stockholders, the Company maintains
stock ownership guidelines (set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Principles, which are available on the Company's website) that require that each executive officer retain a minimum equity
ownership interest in the Company. The Company revised its stock ownership guidelines in March 2014 to, among other things, require certain levels of outright equity ownership, as discussed in more
detail under "Stock Ownership Guidelines" below. • The Company's insider trading policy prohibits the Company's executive officers from short-selling the Company's Common Stock, trading
in derivative securities related to the Company's securities, including the Company's Common Stock, or otherwise engaging in activities designed to hedge against the Company's Common Stock. • Perquisites and other personal benefits do not constitute a significant portion of the compensation for the executive officers. The
Company's executive officers participate in broad-based Company-sponsored health and welfare benefits programs on the same basis as other regular employees. • The Company does not currently offer, nor does the Company have plans to provide, defined benefit pension arrangements or nonqualified
deferred compensation plans or arrangements to its executive officers. Comparison to Peer Companies. Consistent with the compensation philosophies described above, the goal of the Company is to
provide its executive
officers, including the Named Executive Officers, with a compensation program that is competitive relative to its industry peers. To that end, the Compensation Committee evaluates executive
compensation relative to compensation paid to similarly situated executive officers at companies determined to be peer companies of the Company. The Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the
following selected peer companies for fiscal year 2014: • Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. • LSI Corporation • Analog Devices, Inc. • Marvell Technology Group Ltd. • Applied Materials, Inc. • Micron Technology, Inc. • Broadcom Corporation • NetApp, Inc. • Freescale Semiconductor, Ltd. • NVIDIA Corporation • Juniper Networks, Inc. • Seagate Technology PLC • Lam Research Corporation • Texas Instruments Incorporated • Western Digital Corporation 29 Table of Contents These
peer companies were selected using criteria intended to identify companies that: (i) operate in a similar industry as the Company, (ii) compete with the Company for
executive talent, and (iii) are comparable to the Company in size and growth patterns. In addition, the peer selection process targets companies that fall within an approximately 0.5x to 2x
range of the Company's revenue and an approximately 0.3x to 3x multiple of the Company's market capitalization. Companies that fall outside of these parameters may be included based on relevance as
product and/or labor market competitors. With
the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, the Company adjusted its peer group to be utilized for fiscal year 2015. The 2015 peer companies were generally selected
with an objective that they meet a majority of the following criteria: (i) operate in a similar industry as the Company, (ii) have at least a 5% growth in revenue, (iii) have at
least 45% of revenue from non-U.S. markets, (iv) have approximately 0.4x to 2.5x range of the Company's revenue, (v) have research and development expenditures of at least 8% of revenue,
(vi) have at least 35% gross margin, (vii) own and operate fabrication plants, and (viii) have multiple selling channels, including retail and commercial. Companies that fall
outside of these parameters may be included based on relevance as product and/or labor market competitors. The 2015 peer companies are as follows: • Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. • NetApp, Inc. • Analog Devices, Inc. • NVIDIA Corporation • Broadcom Corporation • Seagate Technology PLC • Freescale Semiconductor, Ltd. • Symantec Corporation • Juniper Networks, Inc. • Texas Instruments Incorporated • Marvell Technology Group Ltd. • VMware, Inc. • Micron Technology, Inc. • Western Digital Corporation In
evaluating competitive compensation levels, the Compensation Committee also refers to survey data, which is focused on technology-oriented companies and provided by Radford. While the
Compensation Committee evaluates executive officer compensation relative to the market data, the Compensation Committee does not use a formula for determining compensation for the executive officers,
including
the Named Executive Officers, and therefore does not benchmark compensation at any specific levels relative to the peer companies. In setting compensation for the Named Executive Officers, the
Compensation Committee reviews and considers a multitude of factors, including not only competitiveness, but also experience levels, performance achieved, specific skills or competencies, the desired
pay mix between near-, medium- and long-term incentives, the Company's budget, and the Chief Executive Officer's recommendation (with respect to executive officers other than himself). In determining
the appropriate levels of compensation to be paid to the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee also considers compensation previously realized by the
executive officer in his or her employment with the Company. However, amounts realized from prior compensation were not a material factor in determining the fiscal year 2014 compensation for the Named
Executive Officers. Processes and Procedures. The Company's President and Chief Executive Officer (the "Chief Executive Officer") recommends to the
Compensation
Committee for its approval the base salary, annual bonus and long-term equity compensation levels for the executive officers other than himself, in accordance with the Compensation Committee charter.
At Compensation Committee meetings pertaining to executive officer compensation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer presents compensation recommendations for the executive officers other than
himself and explains to the Compensation Committee the basis and rationale for his recommendations. With respect to his recommendations, the Company's Chief Executive Officer considers the scope and
responsibility of each executive officer's position, the individual performance of each executive officer and the contributions of each executive officer to the Company's performance. He also reviews
survey data on the compensation of similarly 30 Table of Contents situated
executive officers in comparable companies based on size, location and industry, including the Company's peer companies, to the extent that there is a similarly situated executive officer.
Except for the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the Company's executive officers do not have any role in determining or recommending the form or amount of compensation provided to the Named
Executive Officers other than providing financial or other information as the Compensation Committee may request from time to time. With
respect to compensation of each of the executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers the individual performance of the executive officer, the contributions of the
executive officer to the Company's performance and the desired pay mix between near-, medium- and long-term incentives and deliberates to determine an appropriate level of compensation for each
executive officer. With respect to the compensation of each of the executive officers other than the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee also considers the Chief Executive
Officer's recommendations and the basis and rationale for such recommendations, as well as the scope and responsibility of each executive officer's position. The performance of each executive officer
is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee based on whether various performance objectives were met during the preceding review period and, with respect to executive officers other than the
Company's Chief
Executive Officer, based on the Chief Executive Officer's feedback regarding the performance of each executive officer. Each executive officer is given a performance rating based on the Compensation
Committee's review, which is then used in the Compensation Committee's review and analysis of such executive officer's overall compensation. During the course of its deliberations, the Compensation
Committee may also review data pertaining to executive officer compensation data from the Company's peer companies, which data may be prepared and presented by the Company's management and/or a
compensation consulting firm. The
Company's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mehrotra, does not participate in the Compensation Committee deliberations that relate to his personal compensation and excuses himself
from portions of the Compensation Committee meetings during which such deliberations occur. During fiscal year 2014, Mr. Mehrotra attended the portions of the meetings of the Compensation
Committee relating to Company-wide compensation issues and the compensation of the executive officers other than himself. In
fiscal year 2014, the Compensation Committee retained Farient, an outside compensation consultant, to assist in analyzing the Company's peer companies for fiscal year 2015
compensation, and to provide information on compensation-related trends and developments in the Company's industry and fiscal year 2015 peer companies, including equity award practices. Compensia, an
outside compensation consultant that the Company had previously engaged, evaluated the competitiveness of the Company's executive compensation programs relative to the Company's fiscal year 2014 peer
companies and provided information on compensation-related trends and developments in the Company's industry and fiscal year 2014 peer companies, including equity award practices. The Company's Chief
Executive Officer has not met with Farient or Compensia with respect to his individual compensation. The Compensation Committee has reviewed its relationship with Compensia and Farient and determined
that the services provided to the Company do not create any conflicts of interest. Say-on-Pay Results The Board and management value the opinions of the Company's stockholders. At the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, more than 96% of
the votes cast on the say-on-pay advisory vote proposal were in favor of the Company's executive compensation program. The Board and the Compensation Committee reviewed the results of the say-on-pay
vote and in light of the approval of a substantial majority of the Company's stockholders of the executive compensation program, did not make any material changes to the executive compensation
program. At the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approximately 89% of the 31 Table of Contents votes
cast on the say-on-pay frequency vote proposal were in favor of holding a say-on-pay advisory vote every year and, consistent with those results, the Board has implemented an annual advisory
vote on the Company's executive compensation program. The Board and the Compensation Committee recognize that executive pay practices and notions of sound governance principles continue to evolve, and
will continue to evaluate and adapt the Company's executive compensation practices. Elements of the Current Executive Compensation Program Base Salaries The Compensation Committee generally reviews the base salaries of the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, in
the first quarter of each year. To assist with that review, Compensia provided the Compensation Committee with a summary of the base salary levels in effect for comparable executive officers based
upon industry surveys as well as the Company's peer companies (based on their published prior year's data). The Compensation Committee has typically considered such summaries, as well as internal
comparables, individual performance and the Company's financial performance, in reviewing the executive officers' base salary levels. The weighting of these factors by the Compensation Committee has
been subjective, and not formulaic. The Compensation Committee does not use a formula for determining the executive officers' base salaries and other forms of compensation and does not benchmark
compensation at any specific levels relative to the peer companies. Based
on the subjective factors described above, the Compensation Committee determined it was appropriate to set annual base salaries for fiscal year 2014 for Mr. Mehrotra,
Ms. Bruner, Mr. Sadana, and Mr. Nir, effective as of February 25, 2014, at $1,000,000, $620,000, $516,000 and $387,000, respectively. The salary for Mr. Brazeal for
fiscal year 2014 was set by the Company's Chief Executive Officer at $400,000 in connection with his appointment as Chief Legal Officer and Senior Vice President, IP Licensing in December 2014.
The total base salaries effective for fiscal year 2014 for each of the Named Executive Officers are as set forth in the "Salary" column of the Summary Compensation Table. Annual Bonus Awards Although none of the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers who are currently employees of the Company, has an
employment agreement or other contractual right to bonus awards for any given year (other than the change in control agreements entered into with the Named Executive Officers and the severance
benefits agreement entered into with the Company's Chief Executive Officer), in recent years, the Company has granted bonus awards to the Named Executive Officers. These bonus awards were determined
based on the achievement of specified performance goals, which were the same performance goals for the bonus awards provided to the Company's broader employee population. In February 2014, the
Compensation Committee approved the 2014 bonus program in which the employees, including the Named Executive Officers, were participants. Bonus awards provided to the Named Executive Officers under
the 2014 bonus program were designed so that they may qualify as "performance-based" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), with respect
to Messrs. Mehrotra, Sadana, and Nir. The Named Executive Officers' awards under the 2014 bonus program are based on a target bonus amount that is expressed as a percentage of base salary. Such
target bonus amounts for each of Mr. Mehrotra, Ms. Bruner, Mr. Sadana, and Mr. Nir were approved by the Compensation Committee based on its review of comparable bonus
opportunities at the Company's peer companies, internal comparability with percentage targets of other executive officers and the executive officer's level of responsibility, experience and knowledge.
Mr. Brazeal was not eligible for an annual performance-based cash award for fiscal year 2014 as a result of his appointment to his position in December 2014. The target bonus amounts generally
increase as an executive officer's responsibilities 32 Table of Contents increase,
reflecting the Company's compensation philosophy that as an executive officer's level of responsibility increases, a greater portion of that executive officer's total compensation should be
dependent on the Company's performance. In
February 2014, the Compensation Committee set the target bonus percentages for certain Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2014 as follows: 150% of base salary for
Mr. Mehrotra; 100% of base salary for Ms. Bruner; 90% of base salary for Mr. Sadana; and 65% of base salary for Mr. Nir. The 2014 target bonus percentages were consistent
with the target bonus percentages for fiscal year 2013 with the exception of Mr. Nir's target bonus percentage, which was 5% higher than in fiscal year 2013. In accordance with
Section 162(m) of the Code, the Compensation Committee established a maximum bonus amount payable to each of Mr. Mehrotra, Mr. Sadana and Mr. Nir under the 2014 bonus
program of 300% of his target bonus amount in connection with the achievement of the business objectives described below. The Compensation Committee also established a maximum bonus amount payable to
Ms. Bruner under the 2014 bonus program of 300% of her target bonus amount in connection with the achievement of the business objectives described below, although the compensation of the
principal financial officer is not subject to Section 162(m) of the Code. Subject to the maximum target bonus
amount, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to vary the individual bonuses based on the performance of the Company and the individual. The
amount of bonuses payable under the 2014 bonus program was based on the following: (1) the Company's performance during fiscal year 2014 relative to a non-GAAP EPS target,
which constituted 60% of the 2014 bonus program, and (2) the Company's performance relative to strategic objectives, which collectively constituted 40% of the 2014 bonus program. The strategic
objectives approved by the Compensation Committee related to (1) memory technology in 2D NAND, (2) memory technology in 3D NAND, (3) system technology and product platform
competitiveness, (4) strategic OEM customer ratings on quality and metrics related to sample approvals by strategic OEM customers, (5) diversifying client SSD business, and
(6) growing and diversifying enterprise SSD business. In
the aggregate, the Company exceeded the target performance for the strategic objectives. The Company's EPS for fiscal year 2014 was $5.60 per share, which was below the EPS target
that drove the financial objectives portion of the 2014 bonus program, but was above the minimum EPS target whereby bonus payouts are made. Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures," of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 includes a
discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company. The table within the non-GAAP financial measures discussion reconciles the Company's non-GAAP net income to the Company's GAAP-basis
net income and shows how the corresponding per-share amounts were derived. The discussion following that table also includes a description of the adjustments shown in the table, including income tax
adjustments. After
the completion of fiscal year 2014, the Compensation Committee evaluated the fiscal year 2014 performance of the Company and the individual performance of each Named Executive
Officer who was currently an employee of the Company. As a result of the Company's achievement against the financial and strategic objectives described above, each of the Named Executive Officers,
with the exception of Mr. Brazeal, became eligible for the maximum bonus amount of 300% of his or her target bonus amount. The Compensation Committee also considered the individual performance
of the Named Executive Officers eligible for a bonus award, as follows: • Mr. Mehrotra—The Compensation Committee considered Mr. Mehrotra's contributions to the Company's fiscal year
2014 financial performance and the overachievement of its 2014 strategic objectives, as well as his leadership in key decisions about future strategy. 33 Table of Contents • Ms. Bruner—The Compensation Committee considered Ms. Bruner's contributions to the Company's financial
matters, investor relations and other administrative and infrastructure functions and corporate management of the Company, including with respect to her leadership on the integration of Fusion-io. • Mr. Sadana—The Compensation Committee considered Mr. Sadana's contributions to the Company's overall
strategy, and in particular the negotiation and closing of the acquisition of Fusion-io and its subsequent integration. The Compensation Committee also considered Mr. Sadana's leadership in
expanding the Company's venture investments initiative. • Mr. Nir—The Compensation Committee considered Mr. Nir's leadership of the Company's retail strategy and
business, which continued its strong profit profile, market share leadership in key markets, and introduction of new products. The Compensation Committee also considered Mr. Nir's leadership in
the Company's corporate marketing strategy and achievements. Upon
consideration of each of the foregoing company-wide and individual factors, the Compensation Committee determined that the actual bonus awards for fiscal year 2014 for the Named
Executive Officers eligible for such awards should be as follows: $1,875,000 for Mr. Mehrotra (125% of his target bonus); $775,500 for Ms. Bruner (125% of her target bonus); $581,000 for
Mr. Sadana (125% of his target bonus); and $315,000 for Mr. Nir (125% of his target bonus). These annual bonuses earned by the Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2014 are also set
forth in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table. Clawback Policy on Bonus Awards The Section 16 Officers, including the Named Executive Officers, are subject to the Company's clawback policy. The Company's
clawback policy provides that the Board may require reimbursement or forfeiture of all or a portion of any bonus compensation paid to such individual to the extent that (i) the Company's
financial statements are required to be restated as a result of material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws (other than a restatement due to a
change in financial accounting rules), (ii) as a result of such restatement, a performance measure or specified performance target which was a material factor in determining the amount of bonus
compensation previously earned by the individual is restated, and (iii) upon a determination by the Board, a lesser payment of bonus compensation would have been made to the individual based
upon the restated financial results. The Board intends to revisit the Company's clawback policy once the SEC adopts final rules implementing the requirements of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank
Act. Long-Term Share-Based Incentive Awards The Company's policy is that the long-term compensation of the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, should be
directly linked to the value provided to the Company's stockholders. Therefore, 100% of the Named Executive Officers' long-term compensation is
currently awarded in the form of share-based instruments that are in, or valued by reference to, the Company's Common Stock. The Company's share-based awards have been made in the form of a
combination of stock options and RSUs, although the majority of the share-based awards have historically been stock options. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to each annual award is
intended to create a meaningful opportunity for stock ownership in light of the Named Executive Officer's current position with the Company, the economic value of comparable awards to comparable
executive officers at the Company's peer companies, the individual's potential for increased responsibility and promotion over the award term, and the individual's performance in recent periods. The
Compensation Committee also takes into consideration the number of unvested share-based incentive awards held by each Named Executive Officer, in order to 34 Table of Contents maintain
an appropriate level of equity incentive for that individual. However, the Compensation Committee does not adhere to any specific guidelines as to the relative equity award holdings of the
Company's executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers. Furthermore, similar to the setting of base salaries, the weighting of the above factors is subjective, and the Compensation
Committee does not use a formula to determine the number or value of share-based incentive awards granted to any executive officer, including the Named Executive Officers. Timing. The Compensation Committee typically grants long-term share-based incentive awards in the first quarter of the fiscal year,
except for awards
to new hires and awards related to the promotion and retention of current employees. However, there is no formal program, plan or policy in place at the Company or in the Compensation Committee's
charter with respect to the timing of long-term share-based incentive award grants, except as set forth below with respect to grants to new employees and related to promotions and retention. The
Compensation Committee has complete discretion as to when it awards long-term share-based incentive awards. There is also no program, plan or policy related to the timing of grants to the executive
officers in coordination with the release of material nonpublic information. Long-term share-based incentive awards granted to new hires or to promoted employees occur after the new hire has joined
the Company or, in the case of a promoted employee, after the promotion has been approved. For a newly hired or promoted executive officer, the associated stock award is granted at the next meeting of
the Compensation Committee. For a newly hired or promoted employee who is not an executive officer, the associated stock award is granted by the Company's Special Option Committee or Secondary
Executive Committee which generally takes actions at least once per month. Stock Options. The Compensation Committee grants a portion of the long-term share-based incentive awards to the executive officers,
including the
Named Executive Officers, in the form of stock options with an exercise price that is equal to the fair market value of the closing price of the Common Stock on the grant date. Thus, the Named
Executive Officers will only realize value on their stock options if
the Company's stockholders realize value on their shares. The stock options also function as a retention incentive for the Company's executive officers as they generally vest and become exercisable
over a four (4) year period following the grant date. In fiscal year 2014, the Compensation Committee granted stock options to each of the Named Executive Officers. The material terms of these
stock options granted in fiscal year 2014 to the Named Executive Officers are described below under "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2014." RSUs. The Compensation Committee grants a portion of the long-term share-based incentive awards to the executive officers, including
the Named
Executive Officers, in the form of RSUs. An RSU represents a contractual right to receive one share of Common Stock if the applicable vesting requirements are satisfied. The Company has determined
that it is advisable to grant RSUs in addition to stock options (and in lieu of larger stock option grants) in order to minimize stock expense to the Company and dilution to stockholders as well as to
attract and retain the executive officers. RSUs granted in fiscal year 2014 function as a retention incentive as they generally vest and result in the annual issuance of stock over a four
(4) year period following the grant date. In fiscal year 2014, the Compensation Committee granted RSUs subject to such time-based vesting to each of the Named Executive Officers. The material
terms of these RSUs granted in fiscal year 2014 to the Named Executive Officers are described below under "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2014." In
February 2014, the Compensation Committee granted RSUs and stock options to each of Mr. Mehrotra, Ms. Bruner, Mr. Sadana and Mr. Nir, as described under
"Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2014." In December 2014, in connection with his hire, Mr. Brazeal was granted stock options by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, prior to
Mr. Brazeal's appointment as an executive officer, and RSUs by the Compensation Committee upon his appointment as an executive officer. In determining such grants, 35 Table of Contents the
Compensation Committee and the Company's Chief Executive Officer, as applicable, considered the following general factors: • The economic value of the share-based awards granted to comparable executive officers at the Company's peer companies; • The proportional amount and value of the Named Executive Officer's unvested share-based incentive awards in comparison to the other
Named Executive Officers; • The Company's financial performance in fiscal year 2013 (other than for Mr. Brazeal); and • The Named Executive Officer's expected future contributions to the Company. The
Compensation Committee and the Company's Chief Executive Officer, as applicable, also considered the following individual-specific factors: • Mr. Mehrotra—The Compensation Committee considered Mr. Mehrotra's individual performance in the recent
period related to the Company's financial, operational and strategic performance and his continued leadership of the Company. • Ms. Bruner—The Compensation Committee considered Ms. Bruner's position and responsibilities as Executive
Vice President, Administration and Chief Financial Officer and individual performance in the recent period related to the Company's financial matters, investor relations and other administrative and
infrastructure functions, as well as corporate management of the Company. • Mr. Sadana—The Compensation Committee considered Mr. Sadana's position and responsibilities in his then
current role as Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer and individual performance related to the Company's overall strategy and mergers and acquisitions, as well as corporate management
of the Company. • Mr. Brazeal—The Compensation Committee and the Company's Chief Executive Officer considered Mr. Brazeal's
position and responsibilities as Chief Legal Officer and Senior Vice President, IP Licensing. • Mr. Nir—The Compensation Committee considered Mr. Nir's position and responsibilities as Senior Vice
President, Corporate Marketing, and General Manager, Retail, and individual performance related to the Company's corporate marketing activities, retail strategy, as well as the performance of the
Company's retail business. Severance and Other Benefits Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control In order to achieve the Company's compensation objective of attracting, retaining and motivating qualified executive officers, the
Company believes that it needs to provide the executive officers with severance protections that are consistent with the severance protections offered by its peer companies. The Company's philosophy
is that a contractual right to severance pay should exist for certain executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, only upon certain terminations of employment in connection with a
change in control of the Company, and for the Company's Chief Executive Officer, upon certain other terminations of employment. 36 Table of Contents Severance Benefits Agreement Upon Termination of Employment. In connection with his promotion to Chief Executive Officer in January 2011,

Mr. Mehrotra and the Company entered into a separate severance agreement not related to a change in control of the Company, pursuant to which Mr. Mehrotra is entitled to severance
benefits upon his termination without "cause" or voluntary resignation for "good reason" (as those terms are defined in the severance agreement) without regard to whether a change in control has
occurred. The benefits payable to Mr. Mehrotra under his severance agreement are generally the same as provided for under his change in control agreement, which is discussed below, with the
exception that the severance payment is two times his base salary without a
multiple of bonus and he is still entitled to a pro-rata cash incentive bonus for the year in which his termination of employment has occurred. Only the equity awards which would vest over the
twenty-four (24) months following Mr. Mehrotra's termination of employment would accelerate upon his termination of employment (instead of all of Mr. Mehrotra's then outstanding
equity awards as provided for under his change in control agreement). In the event that Mr. Mehrotra is eligible to receive severance benefits under both his severance agreement and his change
in control agreement, he will be entitled only to the severance benefits provided under his change in control agreement. Executive Severance Benefits Agreement Upon a Change in Control. Uncertainty regarding the continued employment of the executive
officers upon the
occurrence or potential occurrence of a change in control transaction results from the fact that many change in control transactions result in significant organizational changes, particularly at the
senior executive level. However, the Company generally does not believe that the executive officers should be entitled to cash severance benefits merely because a change in control transaction occurs.
In order to encourage the executive officers to remain employed with the Company during an important time when their prospects for continued employment following the transaction are often uncertain,
the Company provides executive officers with severance benefits pursuant to a change in control agreement, if their employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by the executive officer
for "good reason" (as those terms are defined in the agreements) within three (3) months before or eighteen (18) months following a change in control (a "Qualifying Termination"). The
Company believes that a protected period of three (3) months before and eighteen (18) months following a change in control is in line with the severance protections provided to
comparable executive officers at the Company's peer companies. Given that none of the Named Executive Officers has an employment agreement that provides for a fixed position or duties, or for a fixed
base salary or fixed annual bonus, absent some form of severance trigger upon "good reason," potential acquirers could constructively terminate a Named Executive Officer's employment and avoid paying
severance. For example, following a change in control, an acquirer could materially demote a Named Executive Officer, reduce significantly his or her salary and/or eliminate his or her annual bonus
opportunity to force the Named Executive Officer to terminate his or her own employment and thereby avoid paying severance. The Company believes that constructive terminations in connection with a
change in control are conceptually the same as actual terminations, and that acquirers would otherwise have an incentive to constructively terminate Named Executive Officers to avoid paying severance.
As a result, the change in control agreements the Company has entered into with its Named Executive Officers permit the Named Executive Officers to terminate their employment in connection with a
change in control for certain "good reasons" that the Company believes result in the constructive termination of the Named Executive Officers' employment. None
of the change in control agreements of the Named Executive Officers provide for a tax "gross-up" obligation by the Company in the event of any excise tax payable as a result of
Section 280G of the Code. Instead, the change in control agreements provide for a "Best Results" methodology (which means that if a Named Executive Officer would be subject to such excise tax,
any payments and benefits must be reduced to avoid triggering the excise tax if the reduction would result in a greater after-tax amount to the executive officer compared to the amount the executive
officer would receive net of the excise tax if no reduction were made). The change in control agreements are for a term of four (4) years 37 Table of Contents and,
with the exception of Mr. Mehrotra's agreement, provide for a severance payment of one and one-half times the annual base salary and target bonus, as well as eighteen (18) months of
Company-paid medical insurance, in the event of a Qualifying Termination. Under Mr. Mehrotra's change in control agreement in effect through December 31, 2014, in the event of a
Qualifying Termination, the severance payment is two times his annual base salary and target bonus and his entitlement to Company-paid medical insurance is for twenty-four (24) months. On
December 21, 2014, the Company entered into a new change in control agreement with Mr. Mehrotra, effective as of January 1, 2015, pursuant to which, in the event of a Qualifying
Termination, the severance payment is three times his annual base salary and target bonus and his entitlement to Company-paid medical insurance is for twenty-four (24) months. As
discussed under "Annual Bonus Awards" and "Subsequent Committee Actions," the Compensation Committee has established a target bonus percentage for each Named Executive Officer.
Severance payments under the change in control agreements are based on these target bonus percentages as in effect for the calendar year in which the change in control occurs, regardless of actual
performance and regardless of whether the Compensation Committee had the discretion to award a lower bonus or no bonus. The Company believes that the use of target bonuses for this purpose is
appropriate to provide certainty to the executive officers and to avoid disputes concerning the calculation of severance payments. The
change in control agreements with the Named Executive Officers also provide certain other severance protections, such as (i) accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards
(with accelerated options to remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following termination, subject to the maximum term of the option); and (ii) executive outplacement benefits for
twelve (12) months following termination (including resume assistance, career evaluation and assessment, individual career counseling, access to one or more on-line employment databases, and
administrative support). Similar to cash severance benefits, the Company believes these other severance benefits are consistent with the severance arrangements of the Company's peer companies and
provide the Named Executive Officers with financial and personal security during a period of time when they are likely to be unemployed. Please
see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below for a description of the potential payments that may be made to the Named Executive Officers in connection
with their termination of employment or a change in control. 401(k) Retirement Benefits The Company provides a retirement benefit opportunity to its executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, under the
terms of its tax-qualified 401(k) plan. In fiscal year 2014, the Company made a discretionary matching contribution on behalf of each participant equal to one-half of the first 6% of compensation
contributed to the plan by the participant. The Named Executive Officers participate in the plan on the same terms as the Company's other participating employees. The Company does not maintain any
other deferred compensation (including nonqualified deferred compensation), defined benefit or supplemental retirement plans for its Named Executive Officers. Subsequent Committee Actions In February 2015, the Compensation Committee established performance targets and a maximum individual bonus payout amount in connection
with the Company's fiscal year 2015 annual cash incentive program (the "2015 bonus program") for the executive officers including the Named Executive Officers. The performance targets under the 2015
bonus program relate to a non-GAAP EPS goal and certain strategic objectives, the attainment of which the Compensation Committee will evaluate following the end of fiscal year 2015. For fiscal year
2015, based on the factors discussed above under "Base Salaries," the Compensation Committee set the fiscal year 2015 base salaries of the Named Executive Officers, with the 38 Table of Contents exception
that there were no changes to the base salary of Mr. Brazeal which was determined in connection with his hire in December 2014, as follows: Mr. Mehrotra, $1,050,000;
Ms. Bruner, $651,000; Mr. Sadana, $542,000; and Mr. Nir, $420,000. These base salary adjustments, effective as of February 23, 2015, reflect increases from the most recent
salaries for each of these Named Executive Officers of 5.0%, 5.0%, 5.0% and 8.5%, respectively. The target bonus percentages remained the same for each of the Named Executive Officers.
Mr. Brazeal's target bonus percentage for fiscal year 2015 is 70% of his annual base salary, which was established in connection with his hire in December 2014. In
February 2015, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of long-term share-based incentive awards to each of the Named Executive Officers, except for Mr. Brazeal who
received a grant in
connection with his hire in December 2014. The awards were in the form of RSUs and stock options. The stock options vest and become exercisable over a four (4) year period following the grant
date. The RSUs vest and result in the annual issuance of stock over a four (4) year period following the grant date. Stock Ownership Guidelines Each Director and executive officer is required to beneficially own Common Stock (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act), with a minimum stock ownership requirement, if any, as determined by the Board from time to time. In 2014, the Company revised its stock ownership guidelines, as set forth in the
Company's Corporate Governance Principles, to establish required minimum equity stakes (calculated by including shares of Company Common Stock owned outright and half a share for each Company unvested
RSU) and outright equity ownership (defined as shares of Company Common Stock owned outright) for Directors and executive officers. The revised stock ownership guidelines provide for a phase-in period
of five years from appointment as a Director or executive officer or from modification of the stock ownership guidelines, provided that if a Director or executive officer achieves compliance with
either (or both, as the case may be) of the required equity stake and the required outright equity ownership prior to expiration of the applicable phase-in period, then the Director or executive
officer must continue to comply with such holding requirement(s) as if the applicable phase-in period had expired. The revised stock ownership guidelines contain the following required minimum equity
stakes and outright equity ownership: Company Position Required Equity Stake Required Outright Equity Ownership Director 5,000 3,000 Chief Executive Officer 65,000 16,250 Executive Vice President 25,000 6,250 Senior Vice President 15,000 3,750 The
Company's Directors and executive officers complied with the stock ownership guidelines in effect in fiscal year 2014. The
Company's stock ownership guidelines are set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Principles, which are available on the Company's website. Insider Trading Policy The Company's insider trading policy prohibits the Company's employees, including executive officers, from short-selling the Company's
Common Stock, trading in derivative securities related to the Company's securities, including the Company's Common Stock, or otherwise engaging in activities designed to hedge against the Company's
Common Stock. 39 Table of Contents Section 162(m) Policy Section 162(m) of the Code disallows a tax deduction to publicly-held companies for compensation paid to certain executive
officers, to the extent that compensation exceeds $1 million per officer in any year. The limitation applies only to compensation which is not considered to be performance-based, either because
it is not tied to the attainment of performance milestones or because it is not paid pursuant to a stockholder-approved plan. The Compensation Committee believes that in establishing the cash and
equity incentive compensation programs for the Company's executive officers, the potential deductibility of the compensation payable under those programs should be only one of a number of relevant
factors taken into consideration, and not the sole governing factor. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee may provide one or more executive officers with the opportunity to earn incentive
compensation, whether through cash bonus programs tied to the Company's financial performance or share-based awards in the form of restricted stock, RSUs or other forms of equity compensation, which
may be in excess of the amount deductible by reason of Section 162(m) or other provisions of the Code. The Compensation Committee believes it is important to maintain incentive compensation at
the requisite level to attract and retain the executive officers essential to the Company's financial success, even if all or part of that compensation may not be deductible by reason of the
Section 162(m) limitation. Accounting for Share-based Compensation The Compensation Committee takes accounting considerations into account in designing compensation plans and arrangements for the
Company's executive officers, other employees, and Directors. Chief among these is ASC 718, the standard which governs the accounting treatment of share-based compensation awards. ASC
718 requires the Company to measure and record in the Company's consolidated statement of operations all share-based payments to executive officers, employees, and Directors based on
their grant date fair values. The application of ASC 718 involves judgment in the determination of inputs into the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model that the Company uses to determine the fair
value of stock options. These inputs are based upon assumptions as to the volatility of the underlying stock, risk free interest rates, dividend yields, and the expected term of the options. As
required under GAAP, the Company reviews its valuation assumptions periodically, and, as a result, the Company's valuation assumptions used to value stock options granted in future periods may vary
from the valuation assumptions the Company has used previously. ASC
718 also requires the Company to recognize the compensation cost of share-based payments based upon the grant date fair value of the award in the Company's consolidated statement of
operations over the period that an employee or Director is required to render service in exchange for the award
(which, generally, will correspond to the award's vesting schedule). This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below for the Company's executive
officers and Directors, even though the Company's executive officers and Directors may never realize any value from their awards. 40 Table of Contents COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with

amounts shown represent the full grant date fair value of the stock awards and option awards granted to the Named Executive Officers
during the fiscal year as computed in accordance with ASC 718. For a discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the valuations of the stock awards and option awards, please see
the discussion of stock awards and option awards contained in Note 10, "Stockholders' Equity and Share-Based Compensation," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 filed with the SEC on February 10, 2015. Under U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), compensation expense with respect to stock awards and option awards granted to the Company's employees is generally recognized over the vesting periods
applicable to the awards. (2) As
described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" under "Elements of the Current Executive Compensation Program—Annual
Bonus Awards," the Named Executive Officers received bonus awards in fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014, in the amounts disclosed. Mr. Brazeal was not eligible for a bonus award for fiscal year
2014 as a result of his appointment to his position in December 2014. (3) The
amounts shown include matching contributions to the Company's 401(k) Plan on behalf of certain Named Executive Officers, imputed income
from term life insurance coverage, and dividends accrued on unvested RSUs. (4) As
an employee-Director, Mr. Mehrotra did not receive additional compensation for his services as a Director in fiscal years 2012, 2013
or 2014. (5) Salary
earned in fiscal year 2012 reflects an increased annual base salary of $475,000 per year, effective as of September 13, 2012, in
connection with Mr. Sadana's promotion to Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. (6) Amounts
shown for Mr. Brazeal are for less than a full year as Mr. Brazeal joined the Company on December 1, 2014.
Mr. Brazeal was appointed as an executive officer of the Company on December 12, 2014. (7) The
amount shown reflects a sign-on bonus, which was paid in January 2015. 42 Table of Contents Compensation of Named Executive Officers The Summary Compensation Table above quantifies the value of the different forms of compensation earned by or awarded to the Named
Executive Officers in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012. The primary elements of each Named Executive Officer's total compensation reported in the table are base salary, an annual cash incentive award
in the form of either a bonus or a non-equity incentive plan compensation award and long-term equity incentives consisting of stock options and RSUs. The Named Executive Officers also earned or were
paid the other benefits listed in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table, as further described in footnotes to the table. The
Summary Compensation Table should be read in conjunction with the tables and narrative descriptions that follow. A description of the material terms of each Named Executive Officer's
base salary and annual bonus is provided immediately following this paragraph. The Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2014 table, and the description of the material terms of the RSUs and
stock options granted in fiscal year 2014 that follows the table, provides information regarding the long-term equity incentives awarded to the Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2014. The
Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2014 Year-End table and the Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal Year 2014 table provide further information on the Named Executive Officers' potential
realizable value and actual value realized with respect to their equity awards. The discussion of the potential payments due upon a termination of employment or change in control that follows in
"Change of Control Benefits Agreements with Named Executive Officers" is intended to further explain the potential future payments that are, or may become, payable to the Named Executive Officers
under certain circumstances. Description of Employment Agreements, Salary and Bonus Amounts As indicated above, none of the Named Executive Officers is employed pursuant to an employment agreement. As a result, their base
salary and bonus opportunities are not fixed by contract. Instead, generally in the first quarter of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee establishes the base salary level for each of the
Named Executive Officers. In making its determination, the Compensation Committee considers the factors discussed above under "Elements of the Current Executive Compensation Program—Base
Salaries." After the completion of fiscal year 2014, the Compensation Committee evaluated the performance of the Company and the individual performance of each Named Executive Officer during the year,
and made bonus payments in March 2015 to each of the Named Executive Officers with respect to fiscal year 2014. The material terms of the bonuses paid with respect to fiscal year 2014 are described
above under "Elements of the Current Executive Compensation Program—Annual Bonus Awards." Consistent
with the Company's philosophy that a substantial portion of compensation should be contingent on the Company's performance, equity and non-equity incentive compensation,
including bonus amounts, for Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2014, the value of which, as described below under "Description of Plan-Based Awards," is significantly dependent upon Company
performance, comprised a large percentage of total compensation. The Company believes this allocation of base salary and incentive compensation in proportion to total compensation is appropriate to
balance the Company's dual goals of aligning the interests of executives and stockholders and providing predictable benefit amounts that reward an executive's continued service. 43 Table of Contents Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2014 The following table presents information regarding the equity incentive awards granted to the Named Executive Officers during fiscal
year 2014 under the 2013 Plan. The material terms of each grant are described below under "Description of Plan-Based Awards." Estimated Possible Payouts under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards All Stock Awards: Number of Shares of Stock or Units (#) All Option Awards: Number of Securities Underlying Options (#) Grant Date Fair Value of Stock and Option Awards ($) (2) Exercise or Base Price of Option Awards ($/Sh) Name Grant Date Threshold ($) (1) Target ($) (1) Maximum ($) (1) Sanjay Mehrotra 2/18/2014 187,500 74.59 3,748,988 2/18/2014 62,500 4,661,875 2/18/2014 — 1,500,000 4,500,000 Judy Bruner 2/18/2014 52,500 74.59 954,634 2/18/2014 17,500 1,305,325 2/18/2014 620,000 1,860,000 Sumit Sadana 2/18/2014 37,500 74.59 681,881 2/18/2014 12,500 932,375 2/18/2014 — 464,400 1,393,200 Mark Brazeal 12/5/2014 25,000 104.47 605,223 12/12/2014 15,000 1,481,850 Shuki Nir 2/18/2014 31,500 74.59 572,780 2/18/2014 10,500 783,195 2/18/2014 — 251,550 754,650 (1) Under
the 2014 bonus program, each Named Executive Officer is eligible for a maximum bonus amount equal to 300% of his or her target bonus
upon the achievement of any one of the objectives established under the 2014 bonus program. However, the Compensation Committee has the ability to exercise its discretion to adjust the actual payout
to a lesser amount or to eliminate the bonus payout entirely. As a matter of practice, the Compensation Committee generally exercises discretion to pay each executive officer a lesser amount upon
consideration of the actual achievement of the financial and strategic objectives in the fiscal year, the relative weightings assigned to the financial and strategic objectives by the Compensation
Committee, the individual performance of the executive officer, and other factors as described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Elements of the Current Executive Compensation
Program—Annual Bonus Awards." Amounts under "Threshold" reflect that no payouts would have been payable under the 2014 bonus program if the Compensation Committee determined that actual
achievement was sufficiently low compared against the established objectives under the 2014 bonus program and exercised its discretion to eliminate the bonus payout entirely. Amounts under "Target"
reflect the target bonus amount, which would have been paid to the executive officer if each of the objectives had been achieved at 100% and the individual performance of each executive officer met
his or her specified target levels, and the Compensation Committee had exercised its discretion accordingly, which, for each executive officer, would have been 100% of his or her target bonus. Actual
bonuses paid under the 2014 bonus program are reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the table labeled "Summary Compensation Table" above. Mr. Brazeal was not
eligible for a bonus award for fiscal year 2014 as a result of his appointment to his position in December 2014. (2) The
amounts represent the full grant date fair value of the stock awards and option awards granted in fiscal year 2014 as computed in
accordance with ASC 718. For a discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the valuations of the stock awards and option awards, please see the discussion of stock awards and
option awards contained in Note 10, "Stockholders' Equity and Share-Based Compensation," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data," of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 filed with the SEC on February 10, 2015. Under GAAP, compensation expense with respect
to stock awards and option awards granted to the Company's employees is generally recognized over the vesting periods applicable to the awards. 44 Table of Contents Description of Plan-Based Awards All actual non-equity incentive plan payouts were made under the 2014 bonus program and are disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table
in the column entitled "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." During
fiscal year 2014, each Named Executive Officer was awarded time-based RSU and stock option awards. Each of these awards was granted under, and is subject to the terms of, the 2013
Plan. The 2013 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has authority to interpret the provisions and make all required determinations under the 2013 Plan. This
authority includes making required proportionate adjustments to outstanding awards upon the occurrence of certain corporate events such as reorganizations, mergers and stock splits and making
provision to ensure that any tax withholding obligations incurred in respect of awards are satisfied.
Awards granted under the 2013 Plan are generally transferable only to a beneficiary of a Named Executive Officer upon his or her death. However, the Compensation Committee may establish procedures for
the transfer of awards to other persons or entities, provided that such transfers comply with applicable securities laws and, with limited exceptions set forth in the plan document, are not made for
value. Under
the terms of the 2013 Plan, if there is a change in control of the Company, each Named Executive Officer's outstanding share-based awards granted under the plan will generally
become fully vested and, in the case of options, exercisable, to the extent such outstanding awards are not substituted or assumed in connection with the transaction. Any options that would vest in
connection with a change in control generally must be exercised prior to the change in control, or they will be canceled in exchange for the right to receive a cash payment in connection with the
change in control transaction. In addition, if there is a change in control of the Company, the Compensation Committee may terminate the performance period applicable to the cash incentive award and
pro-rate (based on the number of days during the performance period prior to the transaction) the bonus and performance objectives based on year-to-date performance. Restricted Stock Units Each RSU reported in the table above and granted to the Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2014 represents a contractual right to
receive one share of the Company's Common Stock if the vesting requirements described below are satisfied. RSUs are credited to a bookkeeping account established by the Company on behalf of each Named
Executive Officer receiving such an award. The RSUs are subject to a four (4) year vesting schedule, with 25% of the units vesting annually from the vesting commencement date. Outstanding RSUs,
however, may terminate earlier in connection with a change in control transaction or a termination of the Named Executive Officer's employment. Subject to any accelerated vesting that may apply, the
unvested portion of the RSU will immediately terminate upon a termination of the Named Executive Officer's employment. RSUs
will generally be paid in an equivalent number of shares of the Company's Common Stock as they vest. The Named Executive Officers are not entitled to voting rights with respect to
the RSUs. However, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to the following dividend equivalent rights with respect to the RSUs. If the Company pays a cash dividend on its Common Stock and the
dividend record date occurs after the grant date and before all of the RSUs have either been paid or terminated, then the Company will credit the Named Executive Officer's bookkeeping account with an
amount equal to (i) the per-share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Common Stock with respect to the dividend record date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of outstanding and
unpaid RSUs (including any unvested RSUs) as of the dividend record date. These dividend equivalents will be subject to the same vesting, payment and 45 Table of Contents other
terms and conditions as the original RSUs to which they relate (except that the dividend equivalents may be paid in cash or such other form as the plan administrator may deem appropriate). Stock Options Each stock option reported in the table above was granted with a per-share exercise price equal to the fair market value of a share of
Common Stock on the grant date. For these purposes, and in accordance with the terms of the 2013 Plan and the Company's option grant practices, the fair market value is equal to the closing price of a
share of Common Stock on NASDAQ on the applicable grant date. Each
stock option granted to the Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2014 is subject to a four (4) year vesting schedule, with 25% of the option vesting on first anniversary
of the vesting commencement date, and the remaining 75% of the option vesting in twelve (12) substantially equal installments on each successive three (3) month anniversary thereafter.
Once vested, each stock option will generally remain exercisable until its normal expiration date. Each of the stock options granted to the Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2014 has a term of
seven (7) years. Outstanding options, however, may terminate earlier in connection with a change in control transaction or a termination of the Named Executive Officer's employment. Subject to
any accelerated vesting that may apply, the unvested portion of the stock option will immediately terminate upon a termination of the Named Executive Officer's employment. The Named Executive Officer
will generally have three (3) months to exercise the vested portion of the stock option following a termination of employment. This period is extended to twelve (12) months if the
termination is on account of the Named Executive Officer's death or permanent disability. However, if a Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated by the Company for "misconduct" (as
determined under the plan), outstanding stock options (whether vested or unvested) will immediately terminate. The
stock options granted to the Named Executive Officers during fiscal year 2014 do not include any dividend or dividend equivalent rights. 46 Table of Contents Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2014 Year-End The following table presents information regarding the outstanding share-based awards held by each Named Executive Officer as of
December 28, 2014, including the vesting dates for the portions of these awards that had not vested as of that date. Additional information regarding these awards is presented in the footnotes

stock option reported in the table above with a grant date on or after June 13, 2013 was granted under, and is subject to, the
2013 Plan. The stock option expiration date shown in column (f) above is the latest date that the stock options may be exercised; however, the stock options may terminate earlier in certain
circumstances described below. For each Named Executive Officer, the unexercisable stock options shown in column (d) above are unvested and will generally terminate if the Named Executive
Officer's employment terminates. 47 Table of Contents The
exercisable stock options shown in column (c) above, and any unexercisable stock options shown in column (d) above that subsequently become exercisable, will generally expire earlier
than the normal expiration date upon the termination of the Named Executive Officer's employment. Unless exercised, exercisable stock options will generally terminate within three (3) months
after the date of termination of employment. However, if a Named Executive Officer dies or becomes totally disabled while employed with the Company, or if their employment is terminated by the Company
without cause or by the executive for good reason within three (3) months prior to or eighteen (18) months following a change in control, exercisable stock options will generally remain
exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Named Executive Officer's death, disability or termination of employment. In addition, the stock options (whether exercisable or not) will
immediately terminate if a Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated by the Company for "misconduct" (as determined under the plan). The stock options may become fully vested and may
terminate earlier than the normal expiration date if there is a change in control of the Company and the stock options are not assumed or replaced by an acquirer. (2) The
shares underlying the RSUs held by the Named Executive Officers are subject to accelerated vesting in connection with certain changes in
control of the Company if not assumed or replaced by an acquirer and upon certain terminations of employment in connection with a change in control of the Company, as described in more detail above
under "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" and below under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." Except as otherwise indicated in those sections, unvested shares underlying the RSUs
will generally be forfeited upon the termination of the Named Executive Officer's employment. (3) The
market value of stock awards reported is computed by multiplying the number of shares or units of stock reported by $101.31, the closing
market price of Common Stock on December 26, 2014, the last trading day in fiscal year 2014. (4) The
unvested portions of these stock options vested on January 3, 2015. (5) The
unvested portions of these stock options vested on February 22, 2015. (6) The
unvested portions of these stock options vest in five (5) substantially equal installments, beginning on February 17, 2015
and at the end of each three (3) month period thereafter. (7) The
unvested portions of these stock options vest in nine (9) substantially equal installments, beginning on February 15, 2015
and at the end of each three (3) month period thereafter. (8) Of
the unvested portions of these stock options, 25% of the stock options vested on February 18, 2015, and the remaining 75% of the
stock options vest in twelve (12) substantially equal installments at the end of each three (3) month period thereafter. (9) Of
the unvested portions of these stock options, 25% of the stock options will vest on December 5, 2015, and the remaining 75% of the
stock options vest in twelve (12) substantially equal installments at the end of each three (3) month period thereafter. (10) The
unvested portions of these stock awards vested on January 3, 2015. (11) The
unvested portions of these stock awards vested on February 22, 2015. (12) The
unvested portions of these stock awards vest in two (2) substantially equal annual installments, beginning on February 17,
2015 and on the anniversary thereafter. (13) The
unvested portions of these stock awards vest in two (2) substantially equal annual installments, beginning on
September 13, 2015 and on the anniversary thereafter. (14) The
unvested portions of these stock awards vest in three (3) substantially equal annual installments, beginning on
February 15, 2015 and on each anniversary thereafter. (15) The
unvested portions of these stock awards vest in four (4) substantially equal annual installments, beginning on
February 18, 2015 and on each anniversary thereafter. (16) The
unvested portions of these stock awards vest in four (4) substantially equal annual installments, beginning on
December 12, 2015 and on each anniversary thereafter. 48 Table of Contents Options Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal Year 2014 The following table presents information regarding the exercise of stock options by the Named Executive Officers during fiscal year
2014 and the vesting during fiscal year 2014 of stock awards previously granted to the Named Executive Officers. Option Awards Stock Awards Name Number of Shares Acquired on Exercise (#) Value Realized on Exercise ($) (1) Number of Shares Acquired on Vesting (#) Value Realized on Vesting ($) (2) Sanjay Mehrotra 470,531 20,157,426 53,125 3,885,477 Judy Bruner 142,912 6,631,351 15,134 1,133,606 Sumit Sadana 44,157 1,807,894 16,934 1,450,320 Mark Brazeal — — — — Shuki Nir 28,705 1,143,758 6,559 491,094 (1) The
dollar amounts shown for option awards are determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Common Stock to which the exercise
of the option related, by (ii) the difference between the per-share sales price of Common Stock at exercise and the exercise price of the options. (2) The
dollar amounts shown for stock awards are determined by multiplying the number of shares or units, as applicable, that vested by the
per-share closing price of Common Stock on the vesting date. Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control The following section describes the benefits that may become payable to Named Executive Officers in connection with certain
terminations of their employment with the Company and/or a change in control of the Company. As prescribed by the SEC's disclosure rules, in calculating the amount of any potential payments to these
Named Executive Officers, the Company has assumed that the applicable triggering event ( i.e. , termination of employment or change in control) occurred
on December 28, 2014 and that the price per share of Common Stock is equal to $101.31, the closing price per share on December 26, 2014 (the last trading day in fiscal year 2014). In
addition to the change in control and termination benefits described below, outstanding share-based awards held by the Company's Named Executive Officers may also be subject to
accelerated vesting in connection with certain changes in control of the Company under the terms of the Company's equity incentive plans as noted under "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year
2014" and "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2014 Year-End" above. The estimated value of accelerated vesting under the Company's equity incentive plans is covered below under the description of
these Named Executive Officers' severance arrangements. The
Company has calculated the value of any option award or stock award that may be accelerated in connection with a change in control of the Company to be the full value of such award
( i.e. , the full "spread" value for option awards and the full price per share of Common Stock for stock awards). Change of Control Benefits Agreements with Named Executive Officers The Company has entered into a change of control agreement with each Named Executive Officer. The agreements are substantially
identical (except as noted below with respect to Mr. Mehrotra) and provide for certain benefits to be paid to the Named Executive Officer in connection with a change of control and/or
termination of employment with the Company under the circumstances described below. 49 Table of Contents Change of Control Benefits. Upon a "Change of Control" (as defined in the change of control agreement) of the Company, for purposes of
the Named
Executive Officer's vesting in then outstanding and unvested performance-based equity awards, the Named Executive Officer will be deemed to have met the performance objectives as of the end of the
specified performance measuring period if the Named Executive Officer remains an employee as of the end of such period. Any performance-based awards that do not vest solely by meeting the performance
objectives shall continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement by assuming the performance objective is met. Severance Benefits—Termination of Employment in Connection with Change in Control. In the event a Named Executive Officer's
employment is
terminated by the Company (or a successor) without "Cause" (and not on account of the Named Executive Officer's death or disability) or by the Named Executive Officer for "Good Reason" (as those terms
are defined in the change of control agreement) within three (3) months before or eighteen (18) months following a Change of Control of the Company (a "Qualifying Termination"), the
Named Executive Officer will be entitled to severance pay that includes: (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to one and one-half times (two times for Mr. Mehrotra) the sum of
(A) the Named Executive Officer's annual base salary as of the Change of Control or termination of employment, whichever is greater, plus (B) the Named Executive Officer's annual target
bonus for the calendar year of termination; (ii) for a period of eighteen (18) months (plus six (6) additional months for Mr. Mehrotra) following the termination date (or,
if earlier, until the date
the Named Executive Officer becomes eligible for coverage under the health plan of a future employer), premiums for 18 months' (24 months' in the case of Mr. Mehrotra)
continuation of the same or equivalent health insurance coverage for the Named Executive Officer and his or her eligible dependents (if applicable) as the Named Executive Officer was receiving
immediately prior to the termination; (iii) accelerated vesting of the Named Executive Officer's equity awards to the extent outstanding on the termination date and not otherwise vested, with
accelerated options to remain exercisable for one (1) year following the termination (subject to the maximum term of the option and to any right that the Company may have to terminate options
in connection with the Change of Control); and (iv) if requested, for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination, executive-level outplacement benefits (which shall include
at least resume assistance, career evaluation and assessment, individual career counseling, access to one or more on-line employment databases (with research assistance provided), and administrative
support). On December 21, 2014, the Company entered into a new change of control agreement with Mr. Mehrotra, effective as of January 1, 2015, pursuant to which, in the event of a
Qualifying Termination, the severance payment is three times his annual base salary and target bonus and his entitlement to Company-paid medical insurance is for twenty-four (24) months. If
following a Change of Control, an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code would apply to any payments or benefits received by a Named Executive Officer, then his or her benefits shall be
either (a) paid in full or (b) delivered to a lesser extent such that no portion would be subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the greatest after-tax benefit to the Named
Executive Officer. 50 Table of Contents The
following table lists the Named Executive Officers and the estimated amounts they would have become entitled to under their change of control agreement had their employment with the
Company terminated on December 28, 2014 under the circumstances described above. Name Estimated Total Value of Cash Payment ($) Estimated Total Value of Insurance Coverage Continuation ($) (1) Estimated Total Value of Equity Acceleration ($) (2) Estimated Value of Outplacement Benefits ($) Total ($) Sanjay Mehrotra 5,000,000 45,594 29,262,637 25,000 34,333,231 Judy Bruner 1,860,000 34,196 8,163,021 25,000 10,082,217 Sumit Sadana 1,470,600 34,196 6,967,569 25,000 8,497,365 Mark Brazeal 1,020,000 33,859 1,519,650 25,000 2,598,509 Shuki Nir 957,825 32,226 4,363,480 25,000 5,378,531 (1) This
amount includes estimated health insurance premiums. (2) This
amount includes option awards and stock awards. The amount for option awards is calculated based on the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been subject to acceleration multiplied by the difference between the closing price of the Common Stock on December 26, 2014 (the last trading day in fiscal year 2014) of
$101.31 per share and the exercise price of the stock option. The amount for stock awards is calculated based on the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to acceleration
multiplied by the closing price of the Common Stock on December 26, 2014 of $101.31 per share. Severance Benefits—Termination of Employment Not in Connection with Change in Control. In connection with his promotion to Chief
Executive Officer in January 2011, Mr. Mehrotra and the Company entered into a severance agreement pursuant to which Mr. Mehrotra is entitled to severance benefits upon his termination
without cause or voluntary resignation for good reason (as those terms are defined in the severance agreement) without regard to whether a change of control has occurred. The benefits payable to
Mr. Mehrotra under his severance agreement are generally the same as provided for under his change of control agreement with the exception that the bonus component of the severance is comprised
of Mr. Mehrotra's pro-rata cash incentive bonus for the year in which his termination of employment occurs instead of a multiple of his target bonus, and only those equity awards which would
have vested over the twenty-four (24) months following Mr. Mehrotra's termination of employment would have accelerated upon his termination of employment, instead of all of
Mr. Mehrotra's then outstanding equity awards as provided for under the change of control agreement. In the event that Mr. Mehrotra is eligible to receive severance benefits under both
his severance agreement and his change of control agreement, he will be entitled only to the severance benefits provided under his change of control agreement. Assuming Mr. Mehrotra's
employment was terminated without "cause" or he resigned for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the severance
agreement) and not in connection with a "Change of Control" (as defined in his change of control agreement) on the last day of fiscal year 2014, the estimated total cash values of
Mr. Mehrotra's cash payment, insurance coverage continuation, equity acceleration and outplacement assistance under his severance agreement would have been the following: $3,500,000, $45,594,
$16,393,681 and $25,000, respectively, for a total amount of $19,964,275. 51 Table of Contents SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT The following table sets forth certain information known to the Company regarding the ownership of Common Stock as of March 2,

subsidiaries and related persons. Under SEC rules, a related person is a Director, officer, nominee for Director, or 5% stockholder of the Company since the beginning of the last fiscal year and their
immediate family members. The Company has adopted a written related person transaction policy and procedures that apply to any transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or a
subsidiary is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. The Audit Committee has determined that, barring additional facts or
circumstances, a related person does not have a direct or indirect material interest in the following categories of transactions: • Any transaction with another company for which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive
officer), director, or beneficial owner of less than 5% of that company's shares, if the amount involved does not exceed the greater of $200,000, or 2% of that company's total annual revenue; • Compensation to executive officers determined by the Compensation Committee; • Compensation to Directors determined by the Board; • Transactions in which all security holders receive proportional benefits; and • Banking-related services involving a bank depository of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee under a trust indenture, or similar
service. In
accordance with the adopted policy and procedures, transactions involving related persons that are not included in one of the above categories are generally reviewed by the Company's
legal department. The legal department determines whether a related person could have a material interest in such a transaction, and any such transaction is submitted to the Audit Committee for
review. The Audit Committee has delegated authority to the chair of the Audit Committee to review any such transactions involving an amount less than $1,000,000. The Audit Committee or its chair, as
applicable, determines whether the related person has a material interest in a transaction and may approve, ratify, rescind, or take other action with respect to the transaction in its discretion. The
son of Irwin Federman, one of the Company's directors, is a Senior Manager in the business development department of the Company's Retail group. Mr. Federman's son's
compensation is consistent with that of others who hold similar roles at the Company. Mr. Federman plays no personal role in determining his son's compensation or reviewing his son's
performance. Mr. Federman does not receive a direct or indirect benefit from his son's position with the Company. In accordance with the related-person transaction approval policy described
above, Mr. Federman's son's employment with the Company was reviewed by the legal department of the Company and submitted for review to the chair of the Audit Committee, who ratified the
transaction. Dr. Chenming
Hu, one of the Company's directors, entered into Consulting Services Agreements with the Company on October 10, 2013, January 13, 2014 and May 7,
2014 (the 'Consulting Agreements"), pursuant to which Dr. Hu provided the Company with advanced memory technology consulting services through July 14, 2014. Dr. Hu earned $237,500
in consulting fees pursuant to the Consulting Agreements in 2014. The Consulting Agreements contain substantially similar terms and include confidentiality provisions in favor of the Company. In
addition to consulting fees, the Consulting Agreements provide for reimbursement, subject to the Company's written approval, of expenses incurred in the performance of 56 Table of Contents work
under the Consulting Agreements. The Consulting Agreement entered into on October 10, 2013 is filed as Exhibit 10.50 to the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 29, 2013, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2014. The Consulting Agreement entered into on January 13, 2014 is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2014, filed with the SEC on May 1, 2015. The Consulting Agreement entered into on May 7, 2014 is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to
the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 29, 2014, filed with the SEC on July 31, 2014. In accordance with the related-person transaction approval policy described
above, the Consulting Agreements were reviewed by the legal department of the Company and submitted for review to the Audit Committee, which ratified the transactions. The
Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), authorizes the Company to provide indemnification of the Company's
Directors and officers, and the Company's Bylaws require the Company to indemnify its Directors and officers, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL"). In addition, each of the Company's current Directors and executive officers has entered into a separate indemnification agreement with the Company. Finally, the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws limit the liability of Directors to the Company or its stockholders to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. The
Company intends that all future transactions between the Company and its officers, Directors, principal stockholders and their affiliates be approved by the Audit Committee or the
chair of the Audit Committee, and be on terms no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties. 57 Table of Contents OTHER BUSINESS The Board knows of no other business that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If other matters are properly
brought before the Annual Meeting; however, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote the shares represented thereby on such matters in accordance with their best

Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors the ability to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods
or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business excluding these items. The Company also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish
operational goals and for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, and not as a
replacement for, data presented in accordance with GAAP. The
Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, provides important supplemental information to
management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the Company's operating results. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides
consistency and comparability with the Company's past financial reports. The
Company has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below
provides an additional measure of the Company's core operating results and facilitates comparisons of the Company's core operating performance against prior periods and the Company's business model
objectives. The Company has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means
to A-1 Table of Contents evaluate
the Company's ongoing core operations. Externally, the Company believes that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of the Company's operating
performance and their valuation of the Company. Internally,
these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by the Company for purposes of: • evaluating the Company's core operating performance; • establishing internal budgets; • setting and determining variable compensation levels; • calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives; • comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models; • strategic planning; and • benchmarking performance externally against the Company's competitors. The
Company excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures: • Share-based Compensation Expense. These expenses consist
primarily of expenses for share-based compensation, such as stock options, RSUs and the Company's employee stock purchase plan. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the
compensation of the Company's employees, the Company excludes share-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. Further, share-based
compensation expenses are based on valuations with many underlying assumptions not in the Company's control that vary over time and may include modifications that may not occur on a predictable cycle,
neither of which is necessarily indicative of the Company's ongoing business performance. In addition, the share-based compensation expenses recorded are often unrelated to the actual compensation an
employee realizes. The Company believes that it is useful to exclude share-based compensation expense for investors to better understand the long-term performance of the Company's core operations and
to facilitate comparison of the Company's results to the Company's prior periods and to the Company's peer companies. • Inventory Step-up. Acquired inventory in a business
combination is generally recognized at fair value less costs to sell, which is generally higher than the historical cost value of the inventory. The Company excludes these increased or "stepped-up"
values of inventory when sold to provide a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods as these costs are not representative of ongoing future costs. • Amortization and Impairment of Acquisition-related Intangible
Assets. The Company incurs amortization, and, occasionally, impairs intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. Since the Company
does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, the Company excludes these items in order to provide investors and others with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. From
time-to-time in the future, there may be other items that the Company may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to
investors and management. A-2 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow. Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2014 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,698 Acquisition of property and equipment, net (233 ) Investment in Flash Ventures (24 ) Notes receivable proceeds from Flash Ventures, net 50 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Free cash flow $ 1,491 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Limitations of Relying on Non-GAAP Financial Measures. The Company has incurred and will incur in the future, many of the costs
that the Company
excludes from the non-GAAP measures, including share-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets
and other acquisition-related costs, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Company's convertible debt and income tax adjustments. These measures should be considered in addition to
results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other
companies. A-3 Signature
