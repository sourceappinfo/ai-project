toward endemic status, widespread inflation and supply chain disruptions and economic slowdowns across many major geographies,
Danaher remained focused on growing its business in the near-term while continuing to invest in long-term growth. Specifically,
in 2022 Danaher: • Continued to evolve its portfolio by announcing the intention to separate
    its Environmental & Applied Solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2023 to create a separate, publicly traded company (to
    be known as Veralto Corporation), which will further advance Danaher’s science and technology transformation. • Invested aggressively in future growth, including investments of approximately
    $1.7 billion in research and development, $1.2 billion in acquisitions and strategic investments and $1.2 billion in capital expenditures. • Returned approximately $700 million to common shareholders through cash dividends
    (marking the 30 th year in a row Danaher has paid a dividend on its common shares) • Grew our business and generated strong financial returns as illustrated below: 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 06 Back to Contents Long-Term Performance We believe a long-term performance period most accurately compares
relative performance within our peer group. Over shorter periods, performance comparisons may be skewed by the easier performance
baselines of peer companies that have experienced periods of underperformance. Danaher has not experienced a sustained period of underperformance
over the last twenty-five years (i.e., 1998 - 2022). We believe the consistency of our performance over that period is unmatched
within our peer group. Danaher is the only company in its peer group whose total shareholder return (“TSR”) outperformed
the S&P 500 Index: • over every rolling 3-year period from and including 1998 - 2022; and • by more than 600 basis points over every rolling 3-year period from and including 2002-2022. Danaher’s compounded average annual shareholder return
has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over each of the last two, three, five-, ten-, fifteen-, twenty- and twenty-five year periods: 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 07 Back to Contents Corporate Governance Highlights Our Board of Directors recognizes that Danaher’s success
over the long-term requires a robust framework of corporate governance that serves the best interests of all our shareholders
and promotes robust risk oversight. Below are highlights of our corporate governance framework. Board refreshment remains a key area of focus for us. We have added five new directors over the
    past four years, reducing Danaher’s average director tenure by more than 16% over that period. Our Bylaws provide for proxy access by shareholders. Our Chairman and CEO positions are separate. Our Board has established a Lead Independent Director position. All of our directors are elected annually. In uncontested elections, our directors must be elected by a majority of the votes cast , and we have a director
    resignation policy that applies to any incumbent director who fails to receive such a majority. Our shareholders have the right to act by written consent. Shareholders owning 25% or more of our outstanding shares may call a special meeting of shareholders. We have never had a shareholder rights plan. We have no supermajority voting requirements in our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. All members of our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees are independent as defined by the
    New York Stock Exchange listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Danaher (including its subsidiaries during the period we have owned them) has made no political contributions in the
    last decade, has no intention of contributing any Danaher funds for political purposes, and discloses its political expenditures
    policy on its public website. The 2022 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability ranked Danaher
    as a First Tier company. Shareholder Engagement Program We actively seek and highly value feedback from our shareholders.
During 2022, in addition to our traditional Investor Relations outreach efforts, we engaged with shareholders representing
approximately 25% of our outstanding shares on topics including our business strategy and financial performance, governance
and executive compensation programs and sustainability initiatives. Attendees included members of our senior management and, in
some cases, members of our Board of Directors. We shared feedback received during these meetings with our Nominating and Governance
Committee and Compensation Committee, informing their decision-making. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 08 Back to Contents Board of Directors Below is an overview of each of the director nominees you are

and Analysis,” with the goal of building long-term value for our shareholders, we have developed an executive compensation
program designed to: • attract and retain executives with the leadership skills, attributes and experience
necessary to succeed in an enterprise with Danaher’s size, diversity and global footprint; • motivate executives to demonstrate exceptional personal performance and perform consistently
at or above the levels that we expect, over the long-term and through a range of economic cycles; and • link compensation to the achievement of corporate goals that we believe best correlate
with the creation of long-term shareholder value. To achieve these objectives our compensation program combines
annual and long-term components, cash and equity, and fixed and variable elements, with a bias toward long-term, performance-based
equity awards tied closely to shareholder returns and subject to significant vesting and/or holding periods. Our executive compensation
program rewards our executive officers when they help increase long-term shareholder value, achieve annual business goals and
build long-term careers with Danaher. Compensation Governance Our Compensation Committee also recognizes that the success of
our executive compensation program over the long-term requires a robust framework of compensation governance. As a result, the
Committee regularly reviews external executive compensation practices and trends and incorporated best practices into our 2022
executive compensation program: WHAT WE DO WHAT WE DON’T DO Four-year vesting requirement for stock options; three-year performance
    period plus further two-year holding period for PSUs No tax gross-up provisions (except as applicable to management
    employees generally such as relocation policy) Incentive compensation programs feature multiple, different performance
    measures aligned with the Company’s strategic performance metrics No dividend/dividend equivalents paid on unvested equity awards Short-term and long-term performance metrics that balance our absolute performance and our relative performance versus peer companies No “single trigger” change of control benefits Rigorous, no-fault clawback policy that is triggered even in
    the absence of wrongdoing No active defined benefit pension program since 2003 Minimum one-year vesting requirement for 95% of shares granted
    under the Company’s stock plan No hedging of Danaher securities permitted Stock ownership requirements for all executive officers No long-term incentive compensation is denominated or paid
    in cash (other than PSU dividend accruals) Limited perquisites and a cap on CEO/CFO personal aircraft usage No above-market returns on deferred compensation plans Independent compensation consultant that performs no other services
    for the Company No overlapping performance metrics between short-term and
    long-term incentive compensation programs 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 12 Back to Contents Named Executive Officers’ 2022 Compensation The following table sets forth the 2022 compensation of our named

    BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR EACH
    OF THE FOREGOING NOMINEES. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 18 Back to Contents Board Selection and Refreshment Director Selection The Board and its Nominating and Governance Committee believe that
it is important that our directors demonstrate: • personal and professional integrity and character; • prominence and reputation in the director’s profession; • skills, expertise and background (including business or other relevant experience) that in aggregate are useful and appropriate
    in overseeing and providing strategic direction with respect to Danaher’s business and serving the long-term interests
    of Danaher’s shareholders; • the capacity and desire to represent the interests of the shareholders as a whole; and • availability to devote sufficient time to the affairs of Danaher. The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for recommending
to the Board a slate of nominees for election at each annual meeting of shareholders. Nominees may be suggested by directors, members
of management, shareholders or by a third-party search firm engaged by the Committee. The Committee considers a wide range of factors
when assessing potential director nominees. This includes consideration of the current composition of the Board, any perceived
need for one or more particular areas of expertise, the balance of management and independent directors, the need for committee-specific
expertise, evaluations of other prospective nominees and the qualifications of each potential nominee relative to the attributes,
skills and experience described above. When Danaher recruits a director candidate, either a search firm engaged
by the Committee or a member of the Board contacts the prospect to assess interest and availability. The candidate will then meet
with members of the Board and at the same time, the Committee with the support of the search firm will conduct such further inquiries
as the Committee deems appropriate. A background check is completed before a final recommendation is made to appoint a candidate
to the Board. A shareholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee for the
Board should notify the Nominating and Governance Committee in writing using the procedures described below under “Other
Information – Communications with the Board of Directors” with whatever supporting material the shareholder considers
appropriate. If a prospective nominee has been identified other than in connection with a director search process initiated by
the Committee, an initial determination is made as to whether to conduct a full evaluation of the candidate based primarily on
whether a new or additional Board member is necessary or appropriate at such time, the likelihood that the prospective nominee
can satisfy the evaluation factors described above, any additional inquiries the Committee may, in its discretion, conduct and
any other factors the Committee may deem appropriate. Director Skills, Expertise, and Diversity Diversity is an important consideration in the Board’s decision-making
with respect to Board composition. The Board does not have a formal or informal policy with respect to diversity but believes that
the Board, taken as a whole, should embody a diverse set of skills, knowledge, experiences and backgrounds appropriate in light
of the Company’s needs, and in this regard also subjectively takes into consideration the diversity (including with respect
to age, race, gender, national origin and U.S. military veteran status) of the Board when considering director nominees. As of
the date of this Proxy Statement, half of the Company’s Board members are diverse from a gender and/or race/ethnicity perspective,
one Board member is a U.S. military veteran and our Board includes a broad range of ages and national origins. Recognizing how
this diversity has contributed to our Board and consistent with the DBS principle of continuous improvement, our Board is committed
to increasing to at or above 30% the percentage of gender-diverse directors by the time of the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 19 Back to Contents The chart that follows illustrates the diverse set of skills, expertise

Danaher management and familiarizes new directors with Danaher’s businesses, strategies, policies and the Danaher Business
System; assists them in developing company and industry knowledge to optimize their Board service; and educates them with respect
to their fiduciary duties and legal responsibilities and Danaher’s sustainability framework. Board Refreshment and Succession Planning Our Board actively considers Board refreshment. Using our Board skills
matrix as a guide as well as the results of our annual Board and committee self-assessment process (discussed below), the Nominating
and Governance Committee evaluates Board composition at least annually and identifies for Board consideration areas of expertise
that would complement and enhance our current Board. Given the critical role of acquisitions in our overall strategy as well as
the diversity of our portfolio, it is essential that our Board include members with the experience of having led the Company through
a range of M&A and economic cycles. However, the Board also seeks to thoughtfully balance the knowledge and experience that
comes from longer-term Board service with the fresh perspectives and new domain expertise that can come from adding new directors. We have added five new directors over the past four years, reducing Danaher’s average director tenure by more than 16% over
that period . The Board addresses succession planning for key Board leadership roles
(such as Chairman of the Board, Lead Independent Director and Committee chairs) by seeking to ensure the depth of expertise on
the Board is sufficient to provide appropriate successors in the event of a succession event. Proxy Access Our Amended and Restated Bylaws (“Bylaws”) permit a shareholder,
or a group of up to twenty shareholders, owning three percent or more of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock
continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s annual meeting proxy materials a number of
director nominees up to the greater of (x) two, or (y) twenty percent of the Board (or, if such amount is not a whole number, the
closest whole number below twenty percent), provided that the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified
in the Bylaws. Majority Voting Standard General Our Bylaws provide for majority voting in uncontested director elections,
and our Board has adopted a director resignation policy. Under the policy, our Board will not appoint or nominate for election
to the Board any person who has not tendered in advance an irrevocable resignation effective in such circumstances where the individual
does not receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election and such resignation is accepted by the Board. If an incumbent
director is not elected by a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, our Nominating and Governance Committee will
submit for prompt consideration by the Board a recommendation whether to accept or reject the director’s resignation. The
Board expects the director whose resignation is under consideration to abstain from participating in any decision regarding that
resignation. Contested Elections At any meeting of shareholders for which the Secretary of the Company
receives a notice that a shareholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the Company’s
Bylaws and such nomination has not been withdrawn on or before the tenth day before the Company first mails its notice of meeting
to the Company’s shareholders, the directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. This means that the nominees
who receive the most affirmative votes would be elected to serve as directors. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 21 Back to Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Corporate Governance Overview Our Board of Directors recognizes that Danaher’s success over the long-term requires a robust framework of corporate governance that serves the best interests of all our shareholders. Below are highlights of our corporate governance framework, and additional details follow in the sections below. Board refreshment remains a key area of focus for us. We have added five new directors over the
        past four years, reducing Danaher’s average director tenure by more than 16% over that period. Our Bylaws provide for proxy access by shareholders. Our Chairman and CEO positions are separate. Our Board has established a Lead Independent Director position. All of our directors are elected annually. In uncontested elections, our directors must be elected by a majority of the votes cast, and we
        have a director resignation policy that applies to any incumbent director who fails to receive such a majority. Our shareholders have the right to act by written consent. Shareholders owning 25% or more of our outstanding shares may call a special meeting of shareholders. We have never had a shareholder rights plan. We have no supermajority voting requirements in our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. All members of our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees are independent
        as defined by the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Danaher (including its subsidiaries during the period we have owned them) has made no political
        contributions since at least 2012, has no intention of contributing any Danaher funds for political purposes, and discloses
        its political expenditures policy on its public website. The 2022 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure
        and Accountability ranked Danaher as a First Tier company. Board Leadership Structure, Oversight and CEO Succession
Planning Board Leadership Structure The Board has separated the positions of Chairman and CEO because
it believes that, at this time, this structure best enables the Board to ensure that Danaher’s business and affairs are managed
effectively and in the best interests of shareholders. This is particularly the case in light of the fact that the Company’s
Chairman is Steven Rales, a co-founder of the Company who owns approximately six percent of the Company’s outstanding shares,
served as CEO of the company from 1984 to 1990 and continues to serve as an executive officer of the company. As a result of his
substantial ownership stake in the Company, the Board believes that Mr. Rales is uniquely able to understand, articulate and advocate
for the rights and interests of the Company’s shareholders. Moreover, Mr. Rales uses his management experience with the Company
and Board tenure to help ensure that the non-management directors have a keen understanding of the Company’s business as
well as the strategic and other risks and opportunities that the Company faces. This enables the Board to more effectively provide
insight and direction to, and exercise oversight of, the Company’s President and CEO and the rest of the management team
responsible for the Company’s day-to-day business (including with respect to risk management). Because Mr. Rales is not independent within the meaning of the NYSE
listing standards, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the appointment of a “Lead Independent Director” and
our independent directors have appointed Ms. Filler as Lead Independent Director. As Lead Independent Director, Ms. Filler: • Presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Executive Committee are
    not present, including the executive sessions of non-management directors, which are typically held at the end of each regularly
    scheduled Board meeting. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 22 Back to Contents • Has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors. Ms. Filler has exercised this authority by typically
    requiring meetings of the non-management directors at the end of every regularly scheduled Board meeting. • Serves as a liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors. Ms. Filler engages frequently with Mr. Steven
    Rales on a range of topics relating to the Board and the Company’s governance program. • Approves information sent to the Board. • Approves meeting agendas for the Board. • Approves meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items. • Engages with major shareholders, including direct communication, as appropriate. Board Oversight Strategy One of the Board’s primary responsibilities is overseeing management’s
development and execution of the Company’s strategy. At least quarterly, the CEO, our executive leadership team and
other business leaders provide detailed business and strategy updates to the Board. The Board annually conducts an even more in-depth
review of the Company’s overall strategy. At these reviews, the Board engages with our executive leadership team and
other business leaders regarding business objectives and the application of DBS, the competitive landscape, economic trends and
other developments. On an annual basis the Board also reviews the Company’s human capital, risk assessment/risk management,
compliance and sustainability programs as well as the Company’s operating budget, and at meetings occurring throughout the
year the Board reviews acquisitions, strategic investments and other capital allocation topics as well as the Company’s operating
and financial performance, among other matters. The Board also looks to the expertise of its committees to inform strategic oversight
in their areas of focus. SPOTLIGHT:
    OVERSIGHT OF STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS The
    Board oversees Danaher’s strategic acquisition and integration process. Danaher views acquisitions as an important element
    of our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. Our Board includes ten members with extensive business combination experience.
    That depth of experience allows the Board to constructively engage with management and effectively evaluate acquisitions for alignment
    with our strategy, culture and financial goals. Management is charged with identifying potential acquisition targets, executing
    transactions and managing integration, and our Board’s oversight extends to each of these elements. Management and the Board
    regularly discuss potential acquisitions and their role in the Company’s overall business strategy. These discussions address
    acquisitions in process and potential future acquisitions, and cover a broad range of matters which may include valuation, due diligence,
    risk and anticipated synergies with Danaher’s businesses and strategy. With respect to more significant acquisitions, such
    as the Company’s 2020 acquisition of Cytiva and 2021 acquisition of Aldevron, the Board typically discusses and evaluates the
    proposed opportunity over multiple meetings. The Board’s acquisition oversight also extends across transactions and over
    time; at least annually the Board reviews and provides feedback regarding the operational and financial performance of our historical
    acquisitions. SPOTLIGHT:
    OVERSIGHT OF HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND CEO SUCCESSION PLANNING • The
                                            Board and Compensation Committee engage with our senior leadership team and human resources
                                            executives on a regular basis across a range of human capital management topics. As discussed
                                            above, Danaher is committed to attracting, developing, engaging and retaining the best people
                                            from around the world to sustain and grow our science and technology leadership. Working
                                            with management, the Board and Compensation Committee oversee matters including culture,
                                            succession planning and development, compensation, benefits, talent recruiting and retention,
                                            associate engagement and diversity, equity and inclusion. The Board reviews the Company’s
                                            human capital strategy annually and at other times during the year in connection with significant
                                            initiatives and acquisitions, supported by the Compensation Committee’s oversight of
                                            our executive and equity compensation programs. • With the support
        of our Nominating and Governance Committee, our Board also maintains and annually reviews both a long-term succession plan and
        emergency succession plan for the CEO position. The foundation of the long-term CEO succession planning process is a CEO
        development model consisting of three dimensions: critical experiences, leadership capabilities and personal characteristics/traits.
        The Board uses the development model as a guide in preparing candidates, and also in evaluating candidates for the CEO and other
        executive positions at the Board’s annual talent review and succession planning session. At the annual session, the Board
        evaluates and compares candidates using the development model, and reviews each candidate’s development actions, progress
        and performance over time. The candidate evaluations are supplemented with periodic 360-degree performance appraisals, and the
        Board also regularly interacts with candidates at Board dinners and lunches, through Board meeting presentations and at the Company’s
        annual leadership conference. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 23 Back to Contents Risk The Board’s role in risk oversight at the Company is consistent with
our leadership structure, with management having day-to-day responsibility for assessing and managing our risk exposure and the
Board and its committees overseeing those efforts, with particular emphasis on the most significant risks facing the Company. The
Board administers its risk oversight responsibilities both through active review and discussion of key risks facing the Company
and by delegating certain risk oversight responsibilities to the Board committees. Generally, the Board delegates risk oversight
responsibility to its committees where it believes the committee’s focused domain expertise will support efficient and effective
oversight, and each committee typically has responsibility with respect to risks that are associated with the purpose of, and responsibilities
delegated to, that committee. Each of the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Science and Technology Committees
reports to the full Board on a regular basis, including as appropriate with respect to the committee’s risk oversight activities.
The timeframe over which the Board and its committees evaluate risk typically varies depending on the nature of the risk. From
time to time, the Board and/or its committees may consider inputs from outside advisors with respect to certain risks and risk
trends. With respect to the manner in which the Board’s risk oversight function impacts the Board’s leadership structure,
as described above, our Board believes that Mr. Steven Rales’ management experience and tenure help the Board to more effectively
exercise its risk oversight function. The graphic below summarizes the primary areas of risk overseen by
the Board and by each of its committees. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 24 Back to Contents Danaher’s disclosure controls and procedures documentation specifically
references our annual enterprise risk assessment process as an element of our disclosure controls and procedures, and requires
membership overlap between Danaher’s Disclosure Committee and Danaher’s Risk Committee. SPOTLIGHT: OVERSIGHT
    OF CYBERSECURITY RISK Danaher’s goal is to maintain a secure environment for our products, data and systems that
        effectively supports our business objectives and customer needs. Our commitment to cybersecurity emphasizes cultivation
        of a security-minded culture through security education and training, and a programmatic and layered approach that reflects
        industry best practice. We have adopted a comprehensive Information Security Policy that clearly articulates Danaher’s
        expectations and requirements with respect to acceptable use, risk management, data privacy, education and awareness,
        security incident management and reporting, identity and access management, third-party management, security (with respect
        to physical assets, products, networks and systems), security monitoring and vulnerability identification. The policy
        sets forth a detailed security incident management and reporting protocol, with clear escalation timelines and responsibilities.
        We also maintain a global incident response plan and regularly conduct exercises to help ensure its effectiveness and
        our overall preparedness. We believe cybersecurity is the responsibility of every associate. We regularly educate and share
        best practices with our associates to raise awareness of cyber threats. Every year, all associates in administrative,
        business, technical, professional, management and executive career categories are required to take information security
        and protection training as part of the Danaher Annual Training Program, and (in most countries where we operate) are required
        to certify their awareness of and compliance with the Information Security Policy. We also conduct monthly education,
        training and cyber-event simulations for our associates to reinforce awareness of the cyber threat landscape. We take measures to regularly improve and update our cybersecurity program, including independent
        program assessments, penetration testing and scanning of our systems for vulnerabilities. The cybersecurity program is led by the Company’s Chief Information Security
        Officer, who along with Danaher’s Chief Information Officer, provide multiple updates each year to the Audit Committee
        regarding this program, including information about cyber-risk management governance and the status of projects to strengthen
        cybersecurity effectiveness. The Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these matters, and the full Board
        also receives periodic briefings from management on our cybersecurity program. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 25 Back to Contents Board of Directors and Committees of the Board General The Board met six times in 2022. All directors attended at least
90% (and twelve of the directors attended 100%) of the total number of meetings of the Board and of the committees of the Board
on which they served held during the period they served. Danaher typically schedules a Board meeting in conjunction with each annual
meeting of shareholders and as a general matter expects that the members of the Board will attend the annual meeting. Thirteen
of our directors (which constituted the entire Board as of such time) attended the Company’s annual meeting in May 2022. The membership of each of the Board’s committees as of March
10, 2023 is set forth below. While each of the committees is authorized to delegate its powers to sub-committees, none of the committees
did so during 2022. The Audit, Compensation, Nominating & Governance and Science & Technology Committees report
to the Board on their actions and recommendations at each regularly scheduled Board meeting. Each such committee typically meets
in executive session, without the presence of management, at its regularly scheduled meetings. Name

        COMMITTEE: Members of our senior management generally attend
        the Compensation Committee meetings. In addition, our CEO: • provides
        background regarding the interrelationship between our business objectives and executive compensation matters and advises on the
        alignment of incentive plan performance measures with our overall strategy; • participates
        in the Committee’s discussions regarding the performance and compensation of the other executive officers and provides recommendations
        to the Committee regarding all significant elements of compensation paid to such officers, their annual, personal performance objectives
        and his evaluation of their performance (the Committee gives considerable weight to our CEO’s evaluation of and recommendations
        with respect to the other executive officers because of his direct knowledge of each such officer’s performance and contributions);
        and • provides
        feedback regarding the companies that he believes Danaher competes with in the marketplace and for executive talent. Our human resources and legal departments also
        assist the Committee Chair in scheduling and setting the agendas for the Committee’s meetings, preparing meeting materials
        and providing the Committee with data relating to executive compensation as requested by the Committee. INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT ROLE
        IN SUPPORTING THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE: Under the terms of its charter, the Committee
        has the authority to engage the services of outside advisors and experts. The Committee has engaged Frederic W. Cook &
        Co., Inc. (“FW Cook”) as its independent compensation consultant since 2008. The Committee engages FW Cook because
        it is considered one of the premier independent compensation consulting firms and has never provided any services to the Company
        other than the compensation-related services provided to or at the direction of the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and
        Governance Committee. FW Cook takes its direction solely from the Committee (and with respect to matters relating to the non-management
        director compensation program, the Nominating and Governance Committee). In addition to the director compensation advice provided
        to the Nominating and Governance Committee, FW Cook’s primary responsibilities in 2022 were to: • provide
        advice and data in connection with the structuring of the executive and equity compensation programs and the compensation levels
        for the Company’s executive officers compared to their peers; • assess
        the Company’s executive compensation program in the context of compensation governance best practices; • update
        the Committee regarding legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as emerging trends and investor views in the area of executive
        compensation; • provide
        data regarding the share dilution costs attributable to the Company’s aggregate equity compensation program; • assist
        in the review of the Company’s executive compensation public disclosures; and • provide
        advice and data in connection with the structuring of the executive and equity compensation programs of Danaher’s EAS business
        (which Danaher intends to separate into a publicly-traded company, to be known as Veralto Corporation, in 2023), and the compensation
        levels for the executive officers thereof compared to their anticipated peers, as well as general advice relating to executive
        and equity compensation matters related to the separation of the EAS business. The Committee does not place any material limitations
        on the scope of the feedback provided by FW Cook. In the course of discharging its responsibilities, FW Cook may from time to time
        and with the Committee’s consent, request from management information regarding compensation amounts and practices, the interrelationship
        between our business objectives and executive compensation matters, the nature of the Company’s executive officer responsibilities
        and other business information. The Committee has considered whether the work performed for or at the direction of the Compensation
        Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee raises any conflict of interest, taking into account the factors listed in
        Exchange Act Rule 10C-1(b)(4), and has concluded that such work does not create any conflict of interest. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 27 Back to Contents NOMINATING &

process consists of the following components: Shareholder Engagement and Alignment Shareholder Engagement Program We actively seek and highly value feedback from our shareholders.
During 2022, in addition to our traditional Investor Relations outreach efforts, we engaged with shareholders representing approximately
25% of our outstanding shares on topics including our business strategy and financial performance, governance and executive
compensation programs and sustainability initiatives. Attendees included members of our senior management and, in some cases, members
of our Board of Directors. We shared feedback received during these meetings with our Nominating and Governance Committee and Compensation
Committee, informing their decision-making. Key Policies Aligning Company and Shareholder
Interests • Director and Executive Officer Stock Ownership Requirements. Our
    Board has adopted stock ownership requirements for non-management directors. Under the requirements, each non-management
    director (within five years of their initial election or appointment) is required to beneficially own Danaher shares with
    a market value of at least five times their annual cash retainer (excluding the additional cash retainers paid to the
    committee chairs and the Lead Independent Director). Once a director has acquired a number of shares that satisfies such ownership
    multiple, such number of shares then becomes such director’s minimum ownership requirement (even if their retainer increases
    or the fair market value of such shares subsequently declines). Under the policy, beneficial ownership includes RSUs held
    by the director, shares in which the director or their spouse or child has a direct or indirect interest and phantom shares
    of Danaher Common Stock in the Non-Employee Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan, but does not include shares subject
    to unexercised stock options or pledged shares. Each Danaher director is in compliance with the policy. We have also adopted
    stock ownership requirements for our executive officers; please see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis –
    Stock Ownership-Related Policies.” • Recoupment Policy. We have a rigorous, “no-fault” compensation
    recoupment policy that applies to executive officers and other senior leaders. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 29 Back to Contents • Anti-Pledging/Hedging Policy. In 2013 Danaher’s Board adopted a policy that prohibits
    any director or executive officer from pledging as security under any obligation any shares of Danaher Common Stock that the
    director or officer directly or indirectly owns and controls, except for any shares that were pledged as of the date the policy
    was adopted. Certain shares of Common Stock owned by Steven Rales and by Mitchell Rales were exempted from the policy
    because such shares had been pledged for decades, to secure lines of credit that reduce the need to sell shares for liquidity
    purposes. Messrs. Steven and Mitchell Rales acquired these pledged shares in cash purchase transactions between 1983 and 1988
    and did not receive them as compensation or purchase them from Danaher. These pledged shares do not count toward the Company’s
    stock ownership requirements. Notwithstanding that these shares are exempted from Danaher’s
policy, as part of its risk oversight function the Audit Committee of Danaher’s Board reviews these share pledges on a quarterly
basis to assess whether such pledging poses an undue risk to the Company. The Committee has concluded that such pledge arrangements
do not pose an undue risk to the Company, based in particular on its consideration of the following factors: • the amount by which the market value of the shares pledged as collateral exceeds the amount of secured
    indebtedness, which the Committee believes is a key factor in assessing the degree of risk posed by the pledging arrangements.
    At December 31, 2022, the maximum amount of secured indebtedness permitted under the lines of credit would not exceed 25%
    of the market value of the shares pledged as collateral; • the number of shares and percentage of total outstanding shares pledged; and • the more than 15% reduction since 2013 in the aggregate number of shares pledged by Messrs. Steven Rales and Mitchell Rales. During 2021 and 2022, we engaged with shareholders regarding the pledge arrangements, representing approximately 25% of
    Danaher’s outstanding common shares, and at Danaher’s 2022 Annual Meeting a significant majority of these shares were voted
    in favor of our Audit Committee members. During these discussions with investors, we answered questions posed by investors
    and using the detail set forth above explained the reasons why the Audit Committee believes it is in the best interest of
    Danaher and its shareholders to allow such pledging arrangements subject to rigorous Audit Committee oversight. Additionally,
    we have incorporated input received from these investor engagements into our public disclosures. Danaher policy also prohibits Danaher directors and employees (including executive officers) from engaging in short sales
    of Danaher Common Stock, transactions in any derivative of a Danaher security (including, but not limited to, buying or selling
    puts, calls or other options (except for instruments granted under a Danaher equity compensation plan)) or any other forms
    of hedging transactions with respect to Danaher securities. • Shareholder Right to Call Special Meeting . Shareholders owning 25% or more of Danaher’s outstanding shares may require the Company to call a special meeting of shareholders. At Danaher’s 2022 Annual Meeting, a minority of the shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote supported a shareholder proposal requesting that Danaher amend its governing documents to reduce the percentage of shares required for shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders from 25% to 10%. Danaher’s Nominating and Governance Committee and Company management annually review Danaher’s governing documents, and the proposal, investor feedback thereon and the voting results (in 2022 and in the prior years when a similar proposal has been brought) were taken into account in considering whether a modification to Danaher’s special meeting threshold is warranted. It was determined that the existing 25% threshold continues to strike an appropriate balance between avoiding waste of Danaher and shareholder resources on addressing narrow or special interests, while at the same time ensuring that shareholders holding a significant minority of our outstanding shares have an appropriate mechanism to call a special meeting if they deem it appropriate. Sustainability For an overview of Danaher’s sustainability program, please
see “Proxy Statement Summary – Sustainability.” Corporate Governance Guidelines, Committee Charters
and Code of Conduct As part of its ongoing commitment to good corporate governance,
our Board of Directors has codified its corporate governance practices into a set of Corporate Governance Guidelines and has also
adopted written charters for each of the committees of the Board. Danaher has also adopted a code of business conduct and ethics
for directors, officers (including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer)
and employees, known as the Code of Conduct. The Corporate Governance Guidelines, charters of each of the Audit, Compensation and
Nominating and Governance Committees and Code of Conduct are available in the “Investors – Corporate Governance”
section of our website at http://www.danaher.com. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 30 Back to Contents DIRECTOR COMPENSATION Non-Management Director Compensation Program Non-Management Director Compensation Philosophy We use a combination of cash and equity-based compensation to
attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on the Board. In setting director compensation, the Board and the Nominating and
Governance Committee are guided by the following principles: • compensation should fairly pay directors for work required in a company of our size
and scope, and differentiate among directors where appropriate to reflect different levels of responsibilities; • a significant portion of the total compensation should be paid in stock-based awards
to align directors’ interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders; and • the structure of the compensation program should be simple and transparent. Process for Setting Non-Management Director Compensation The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing
and making recommendations to the Board regarding non-management director compensation (although the Board makes the final determination
regarding the amounts and type of non-management director compensation). The Committee engages FW Cook, the Board’s independent
compensation consultant, to prepare regular reports on market non-management director compensation practices and evaluate our program
in light of the results of such reports. The Committee typically reviews, and seeks advice from FW Cook regarding, the Company’s
non-management director compensation on an annual basis. Danaher’s 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”
or the “Omnibus Plan”) limits the amount of cash and equity compensation that we may pay to a non-management director
each year. Under the plan terms, an annual limit of $800,000 per calendar year applies to the sum of all cash and equity-based
awards (calculated based on the grant date fair value of such awards for financial reporting purposes) granted to each non-management
director for services as a member of the Board (plus an additional limit of $500,000 per calendar year with respect to any non-executive
Board chair or vice chair). 2023 Non-Management Director Compensation Structure Director cash retainers are paid quarterly in arrears. Director
annual equity awards are divided equally (based on target award value) between options and RSUs. The options are fully vested as
of the grant date. The RSUs vest upon the earlier of (1) the first anniversary of the grant date, or (2) the date of, and
immediately prior to, the next annual meeting of Danaher’s shareholders following the grant date, but the underlying shares
are not issued until the earlier of the director’s death or the first day of the seventh month following the director’s
retirement from the Board. Danaher also reimburses directors for Danaher-related out-of-pocket expenses, including travel expenses. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 31 Back to Contents Non-Management Directors’ Deferred Compensation
Plan Each non-management director can elect to defer all or part of
the cash director fees that the director earns with respect to a particular year under the Non-Employee Directors’ Deferred
Compensation Plan, which is a sub-plan under the Omnibus Plan. Amounts deferred under the plan are converted into a particular
number of phantom shares of Danaher Common Stock, calculated based on the closing price of Danaher’s Common Stock on the
date that such quarterly fees would otherwise have been paid, and are maintained in bookkeeping accounts. Dividends accrued on
phantom shares are also deemed invested in phantom shares of Danaher Common Stock. A director may elect to have their plan balance
distributed upon cessation of Board service, or one, two, three, four or five years after cessation of Board service. All distributions
from the plan are in the form of shares of Danaher Common Stock. Director Summary Compensation Table The table below summarizes the compensation paid by Danaher to
the non-management directors for the year ended December 31, 2022. Each of Steven Rales, Mitchell Rales and Rainer M. Blair serves
as a director and executive officer of Danaher but they have not received and do not receive any additional compensation for services
provided as a director. Neither Steven Rales nor Mitchell Rales is a named executive officer. Details regarding the 2022 executive

    represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the applicable award computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. With
    respect to stock awards, the grant date fair value under FASB ASC Topic 718 is calculated based on the number of shares of
    Common Stock underlying the award, times the closing price of the Danaher Common Stock on the date of grant (but discounted
    to account for the fact that RSUs do not accrue dividend rights prior to vesting and distribution). With respect to stock
    options, the grant date fair value under FASB ASC Topic 718 has been calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
    based on the following assumptions (and assuming no forfeitures): for the 2022 stock option grants to all directors above
    other than Mr. Dewan, a 7.5 year option life; a risk-free interest rate of 2.86%; a stock price volatility rate of 32.83%;
    and a dividend yield of 0.40% per share; for the 2022 stock option grant to Mr. Dewan, a 7.5 year option life, a risk-free
    interest rate of 3.04%; a stock price volatility rate of 30.48%; and a dividend yield of 0.39% per year. (2) The table below sets forth as to each non-management
    director the aggregate number of unvested RSUs and aggregate number of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2022.

Zerhouni, MD. 549 (4) Mr. Dewan was appointed to the Board in June 2022. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 33 Back to Contents DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS Director Independence At least a majority of the Board must qualify as independent within
the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE. The Board has affirmatively determined that Mss. Filler and List, Messrs. Dewan,
Lohr, Sanders, Schwieters and Spoon, Professor Stevens and Drs. Mega and Zerhouni are independent within the meaning of the listing
standards of the NYSE. The Board concluded that none of these directors possesses any of the bright-line relationships set forth
in the listing standards of the NYSE that prevent independence, or except as discussed below, any other relationship with Danaher
other than Board membership. In making its determination with respect to the independence of the
directors identified above as independent, the Board considered that in 2022, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries sold
products and/or services to and purchased products and/ or services from organizations with whom certain of the independent directors
are or were employed. In each such case, the amount of sales and the amount of purchases were less than 1.0% of the annual revenues
of such other organization and of Danaher’s 2022 revenues. The Board also considered that all of the transactions referenced
in the prior sentence were conducted in the ordinary course of business and on an arms’-length basis. Danaher’s non-management directors meet in executive session
following the Board’s regularly-scheduled meetings. The sessions are chaired by the Lead Independent Director. In addition,
at least once each year Danaher’s independent directors meet in executive session following a regularly-scheduled Board meeting,
and the Lead Independent Director chairs such sessions as well. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Policy Under Danaher’s written Related Person Transactions Policy,
the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board is required to review and if appropriate approve all related person transactions
prior to consummation. The Committee is required to review and consider all relevant information available to it about each related
person transaction, and a transaction is considered approved under the policy if the Committee authorizes it according to the terms
of the policy after full disclosure of the related person’s interests in the transaction. Related person transactions of
an ongoing nature are reviewed annually by the Committee. The definition of “related person transactions” for purposes
of the policy covers the transactions that are required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act. Relationships and Transactions For their service as executive officers, in 2022 each of Steven Rales
and Mitchell Rales received a salary of $419,000 and was entitled to participate in all of the benefits made generally available
to salaried employees as well as all perquisites made generally available to Danaher’s executive officers. Steven Rales also
received a 401(k) plan contribution of $21,244 and Mitchell Rales received a 401(k) plan contribution of $3,771 and a non-elective
contribution of $19,406 into his ECP account. The Rales’ do not receive cash incentive compensation or equity awards. In
2022, Danaher provided to the Rales’ tax and accounting services at a cost to Danaher of approximately $330,319 in the form
of one full-time employee (plus health and welfare benefits for such employee), allowed the Rales’ to make personal use of
designated Danaher office space at a cost to Danaher of approximately $301,105 and provided Mr. Steven Rales with a personal car
and parking at a cost to Danaher of approximately $3,865. The incremental cost to the Company of the perquisites set forth above
is based on the Company’s out-of-pocket costs. Danaher also provided a full-time executive assistant to each of the Rales’
to support them in their roles as Danaher executive officers. In each case, their use of a minority of their assistant’s
time for non-Danaher matters resulted in no incremental cost to Danaher. Separately, in 2022, Steven Rales and Mitchell Rales paid
Danaher approximately $145,000 for providing benefits for, and as reimbursement for paying a portion of the salaries of, persons
who provide services to the Rales’. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 34 Back to Contents FJ900, Inc. (“FJ900”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary
of Danaher, is party to an airplane management agreement with Joust Capital II, LLC (“Joust II”) and a substantially
identical agreement with Joust Capital III, LLC (“Joust III” and together with Joust II, the “Joust entities”).
Joust II is controlled by Mitchell Rales and Joust III is controlled by Steven Rales. Under the management agreements, FJ900 performs
management services for the respective aircraft owned by each of the Joust entities in like manner to the management services provided
by FJ900 for Danaher’s aircraft. The management services provided by FJ900 include the provision of aircraft management,
pilot services, maintenance, record-keeping, aircraft procurement and disposition and other aviation services. FJ900 receives no
compensation for its services under the agreements. Having FJ900 perform management services for all of these aircraft enables
Danaher and the Joust entities to share certain fixed expenses relating to the use, maintenance, storage, operation and supervision
of their respective aircraft and utilize joint purchasing or joint bargaining arrangements where applicable and appropriate, allowing
each party to benefit from efficiencies of scale and cost savings. We believe that this cost-sharing arrangement results in lower
costs to Danaher than if we incurred these fixed costs on a stand-alone basis. Under the agreement, FJ900 prorates all shared expenses
annually among the Joust entities and Danaher based primarily on each party’s flight hours logged for the year. The Joust
entities pre-pay FJ900 on a quarterly basis for their estimated, prorated portion of such shared expenses, and the amounts are
trued up at the end of the year. With respect to the year ended December 31, 2022, the Joust entities together paid FJ900 approximately
$3.6 million for the Joust entities’ share of the fixed airplane management expenses shared with Danaher. Each Joust entity
pays directly all expenses attributable to its aircraft that are not shared. Under the management agreements, each party is also
required to maintain a prescribed amount of comprehensive aviation liability insurance and name the other party and its affiliates
as additional named insureds, while the Joust entities must also maintain all-risk hull insurance for their aircraft. If either
party suffers any losses in connection with the arrangements set forth in the management agreement, and such losses are due to
the fault, negligence, breach or strict liability of the other party, the sole recourse of the party incurring the loss against
the other party is to the available insurance proceeds. Each management agreement may be terminated by any party upon 30 days’
notice. In addition, Danaher is party to substantially identical airplane
interchange agreements with each of the Joust entities with respect to each respective aircraft owned by Danaher and by each of
the Joust entities. Under each interchange agreement, the Joust entity has agreed to lease its aircraft to Danaher and Danaher
has agreed to lease the respective Danaher aircraft to the Joust entity, in each case on a non-exclusive basis. Neither party is
charged for its use of the other party’s aircraft, the intent being that over the life of the contract each party’s
usage of the other party’s aircraft will be generally equal. With respect to the year ended December 31, 2022, the incremental
value of the use of the Joust aircraft by Danaher, net of the incremental value of the use of the Danaher aircraft by the Joust
entities, was approximately $45,000. The owner of each aircraft, as operator of the aircraft, is responsible for providing a flight
crew for all flights operated under the interchange agreement. Each owner/operator is required to maintain standard insurance,
including all-risk hull insurance and a prescribed amount of comprehensive aviation liability insurance, and to name the other
party and its affiliates as additional named insureds. With respect to any losses suffered by the party using the owner/operator’s
plane, the using party’s recourse against the owner/ operator is limited to the amount of available insurance proceeds. To
the extent the using party and/or any third party suffers losses in connection with the using party’s use of the owner/operator’s
aircraft, and recovers from the owner/operator an amount in excess of the available insurance proceeds, the using party will indemnify
the owner/operator for all such excess amounts. The interchange agreements may be terminated by either party upon 10 days’
notice. Following market close on July 22, 2022, Walter G. Lohr, Jr., a member
of the Board, exercised a stock option to purchase 3,906 shares of Danaher common stock and sold the resulting shares (net of 642
shares Danaher withheld to account for the exercise price) to Danaher at a per-share sale price equal to the closing price of Danaher’s
common stock on such date, for an aggregate sale price of $1,069,689. Structuring the option exercise in this way obviated any
filing requirement by Mr. Lohr under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, resulting in significant cost savings
to Danaher. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 35 Back to Contents BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF DANAHER COMMON STOCK BY DIRECTORS,

Firm The Audit Committee on behalf of Danaher has selected Ernst &
Young LLP, an international accounting firm of independent certified public accountants, to act as the independent registered public
accounting firm for Danaher and its consolidated subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2023. Representatives of Ernst &
Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do
so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. Although shareholder approval of the selection of Ernst & Young
LLP is not required by law, Danaher’s Board believes that it is advisable to give shareholders an opportunity to ratify this
selection. If this proposal is not approved by Danaher’s shareholders at the 2023 Annual Meeting, the Audit Committee will
reconsider its selection of Ernst & Young LLP. Even if the selection of Ernst & Young LLP is ratified, the Audit Committee
in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines
that such a change would be in the best interests of Danaher and its shareholders. THE
    BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION
    OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP TO SERVE AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR DANAHER FOR 2023. Audit Fees and All Other Fees The following table sets forth the fees for audit, audit-related,

firm’s independence and has concluded that such services do not impair such firm’s independence. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 38 Back to Contents Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible
Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditors Under its charter, the Audit Committee must pre-approve all auditing
services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for Danaher by the independent registered public accounting firm. Each
year, the Committee approves the independent registered public accounting firm’s retention to audit Danaher’s financial
statements and internal control over financial reporting before the filing of the preceding year’s annual report on Form
10-K. The Committee also establishes detailed pre-approved categories of non-audit services that may be performed by the independent
auditor during the year, subject to certain monetary limits. With respect to additional non-audit services by the independent auditors
that either are not covered by the pre-approved categories, or exceed the pre-approved monetary limits, the Committee approves
or rejects each engagement. In each case, the Committee takes into account whether the services are permissible under applicable
law and the possible impact of each non-audit service on the independent registered public accounting firm’s independence
from management. The Committee may delegate to a subcommittee of one or more members the authority to grant preapprovals of audit
and permitted non-audit services, and the decisions of such subcommittee to grant preapprovals must be presented to the full Committee
at its next scheduled meeting. The Committee has not made any such delegation as of the date of this Proxy Statement. Audit Committee Report This report is not deemed to be “soliciting material”
or to be “filed” with the SEC or subject to the SEC’s proxy rules or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the
Exchange Act of 1934, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any prior or subsequent filing by Danaher under
the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent Danaher specifically incorporates this report by reference
therein. The Audit Committee assists the Board in overseeing the quality and
integrity of Danaher’s financial statements, the effectiveness of Danaher’s internal control over financial reporting,
the qualifications, independence and performance of Danaher’s independent registered public accounting firm, the performance
of Danaher’s internal audit function, Danaher’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, Danaher’s
major financial risk exposures, significant legal, compliance, reputational, cybersecurity and privacy risks and overall risk assessment
and risk management policies, and Danaher’s swaps and derivatives transactions and related policies and procedures. The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation
and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit Danaher’s financial statements and has
appointed Ernst & Young LLP as Danaher’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2023. The Audit Committee
evaluates Ernst & Young’s performance at least annually. In evaluating Ernst & Young and determining whether to reappoint
the firm as Danaher’s independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee took into consideration a number
of factors, including the firm’s tenure, independence, global capability and expertise and performance. Ernst & Young
has been retained as Danaher’s independent registered public accounting firm continuously since 2002. The Audit Committee
periodically considers the advisability and impact of rotating our independent registered public accountants. In conjunction with
the mandated rotation of Ernst & Young’s lead engagement partner every five years, the Audit Committee (including its
chair) are directly involved in the selection of Ernst & Young’s new lead engagement partner. The Audit Committee is
also responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with Danaher’s retention of Ernst & Young. Danaher’s
Board of Directors and Audit Committee believe they have undertaken appropriate steps with respect to oversight of Ernst &
Young’s independence and that the continued retention of Ernst & Young to serve as Danaher’s independent registered
public accounting firm is in the best interests of Danaher and its shareholders. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee has reviewed
and discussed with Danaher’s management and Ernst & Young Danaher’s audited consolidated financial statements and
internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed with Ernst & Young those matters
required to be discussed under the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”)
and the SEC. In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young required
by the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning
independence, and has discussed with Ernst & Young its independence. The Audit Committee has concluded that Ernst & Young’s
provision of non-audit services as described in the table above is compatible with Ernst & Young’s independence. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit
Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements for Danaher for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2022 be included in Danaher’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for filing with the SEC. Audit Committee of the Board of Directors John T.

toward endemic status, widespread inflation and supply chain disruptions and economic slowdowns across many major geographies,
Danaher remained focused on growing its business in the near-term while continuing to invest in long-term growth. Specifically,
in 2022 Danaher: • Continued to evolve its portfolio by announcing
    the intention to separate its Environmental & Applied Solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2023 to create a
    separate, publicly traded company (to be known as Veralto Corporation), which will further advance Danaher’s science and technology
    transformation. • Invested aggressively in future growth, including investments of
    approximately $1.7 billion in research and development, $1.2 billion in acquisitions and strategic investments and $1.2 billion
    in capital expenditures. • Returned approximately $700 million to common shareholders through
    cash dividends (marking the 30 th year in a row Danaher has paid a dividend on its common shares) • Increased revenues by 7% and net earnings attributable to common
    shareholders by 13.5% on a year-over-year basis, and generated more than $8 billion of operating cash flow. For a further discussion of Danaher’s business performance in
2022 and over the long term, please see “Proxy Statement Summary – Business Highlights.” 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 40 Back to Contents Executive Compensation Program Objectives With the goal of building long-term value for our shareholders, we
maintain an executive compensation program designed to: • attract and retain executives with the leadership
    skills, attributes and experience necessary to succeed in an enterprise with Danaher’s size, diversity and global footprint; • motivate executives to demonstrate exceptional personal performance
    and perform consistently at or above the levels that we expect, over the long-term and through a range of economic cycles;
    and • link compensation to the achievement of goals and objectives that
    we believe best correlate with the creation of long-term shareholder value, including financial and strategic as well as sustainability-related
    objectives. To achieve these objectives our compensation program combines annual
and long-term components, cash and equity, and fixed and variable elements, with a bias toward long-term equity awards tied closely
to shareholder returns and subject to significant vesting and/or holding periods. Our executive compensation program rewards our
executive officers when they help increase long-term shareholder value, achieve annual business goals and build long-term careers
with Danaher. The science and technology markets in which we operate are competitive,
with demand sometimes exceeding the supply of talent, resulting in significant increases in compensation paid by the companies
with whom we compete for this talent. The same conditions exist in the market for executive-level talent that can provide innovative
leadership while managing at a global scale across multiple complex businesses. These trends require us to regularly and proactively
assess our executive compensation program to ensure it remains competitive in light of market conditions. Key Recent Changes to Executive Compensation Program Danaher’s Compensation Committee regularly reviews our executive
compensation program with a view toward continuous improvement and consideration of investor feedback. As a result of this review,
effective in 2022 the Committee shortened the vesting period for the stock options granted to executive officers to four years.
The Committee concluded that a four-year vesting period for stock options most effectively balances (1) retention considerations
in an increasingly competitive market for executive talent, and (2) the traditional, long-term focus of our executive compensation
program. In recent years, the Committee has made other enhancements to the
program to reinforce the already-strong linkages (1) between pay and performance, (2) between the interests of our shareholders
and the interests of our executive officers, and (3) between the Company’s strategic plan and executive compensation program. These improvements have included the introduction of a core revenue growth performance metric in our executive short-term incentive
compensation program; and an executive long-term incentive compensation program that is entirely performance-based. The Committee has enhanced our executive compensation program over
the last several years to reinforce our performance-oriented culture and expects to continue to improve the program as appropriate,
but also believes that consistent use of best-practice designs is important in effectively communicating key messages to our executives.
As a result, the Committee does not revise the program to align with emerging trends unless it sees a clear business rationale
for Danaher. 2022 Say-On-Pay Vote We provide our shareholders the opportunity to cast an annual advisory
vote with respect to our NEO compensation as disclosed in our annual proxy statement (the “say on pay proposal”). At
our annual meeting of shareholders in May 2022, 94% of the votes cast on the say on pay proposal were voted in favor of the proposal. The Committee believes this result affirms shareholders’ support of the Company’s NEO compensation and did not
make changes to the Company’s executive compensation program as a result of such vote. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 41 Back to Contents 2022 Executive Compensation The chart below summarizes key information with respect to each pay
element represented in Danaher’s 2022 executive compensation program: Pay Element Primary Objectives Form Performance Requirement Key Committee Considerations in Determining 2022 Compensation Long-Term Incentive Compensation (Equity) • Attract, retain and
        motivate skilled executives • Align the interests
        of management and shareholders by ensuring that realized compensation is: • in the case of stock
        options, commensurate with long-term changes in share price; and • in the case of PSUs,
        tied to (1) long-term changes in share price at all performance levels, and (2) attainment of relative TSR and average
        ROIC performance goals. Stock options • 4-year, time-based
        vesting schedule • Options only have/increase
        in value if Danaher stock price increases • This pay element represented
        the most significant component of compensation for each NEO for 2022. • This pay element has
        the heaviest weighting of all our executive compensation program elements because it best supports our retention and motivation
        objectives and aligns the interests of our executives and shareholders. • From time to time,
        we also grant time-vested restricted stock units to executive officers, such as in connection with new hires or promotions
        or for retention purposes. A portion of the stock compensation granted to Dr. Gutierrez-Ramos in 2022 was granted in RSUs,
        constituting an installment of the sign-on equity award Danaher agreed to grant him in connection with his joining the
        Company in 2020. Performance stock units (PSUs) • 3-year relative TSR
        (and average ROIC performance as a modifier) • 2-year holding period
        (incremental to 3-year performance period) Annual Cash Incentive Compensation • Motivate executives
        to achieve near-term operational and financial goals that support our long-term business objectives and strategic priorities • Attract, retain and
        motivate skilled executives • Allow for meaningful
        pay differentiation tied to annual performance of individuals and groups Cash This pay element represented the second-most significant component of compensation
    for each NEO for 2022. Its focus on near-term performance and the cash nature of the award complements the longer-term, equity-
    based compensation elements of our program. Fixed Annual Compensation • Provide sufficient fixed compensation
    to (1) allow a reasonable standard of living relative to peers, and (2) mitigate incentive to pursue inappropriate risk-taking
    to maximize variable pay Cash N/A • Base salary should
        be sufficient to avoid competitive disadvantage while facilitating a sustainable fixed cost structure. • We also periodically
        use fixed cash bonuses for recruitment and retention purposes to attract and retain high-performing executives. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 42 Back to Contents 2022 Executive Compensation (cont.) Pay Element Primary Objectives Form Performance Requirement Key Committee Considerations in Determining 2022 Compensation Other Compensation • Make
        our total executive compensation plan competitive • Improve
        cost-effectiveness by delivering perceived value that exceeds our actual costs Employee benefit plans; limited perquisites; severance benefits N/A • We
        believe these elements of compensation make our total executive compensation plan competitive and are generally commensurate
        with the benefits offered by our peers. • We
        believe the limited perquisites we offer are cost-effective in that the perceived value is higher than our actual cost,
        and they help to maximize the amount of time that executives spend on Danaher business. (1) Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Free
    Cash Flow-to-Adjusted Net Income Ratio (which we also refer to as “Free Cash Flow Ratio”) and Core Revenue Growth
    are financial measures that do not
    comply with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Appendix A to this Proxy Statement quantifies
    and reconciles these measures to the comparable 2022 GAAP financial measures. “Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share”
    or “Adjusted EPS” means the Company’s “Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share” from
    continuing operations for the fiscal year ending
    December 31, 2022 as reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K furnished by the Company on January 24, 2023 (“Form 8-K”),
    but excluding: (1) the impact of any change in accounting principles that occurred
    during the performance period and the cumulative effect thereof, to the extent such change was not considered in establishing
    target performance levels (the Committee may either apply the changed accounting
    principle to the performance period, or exclude the impact of the change in accounting principle from the
    period); and (2)(i) all transaction and financing costs directly related to the acquisition of any whole or partial interest
    in a business, (ii) all restructuring charges directly related to or arising from
    any business as to which the Company acquired a whole or partial interest and incurred within two years of the acquisition
    date, (iii) all charges and gains arising from the resolution of contingent liabilities
    identified as of the acquisition date and related to any business as to which the Company acquired a whole or partial interest,
    (iv) all other charges directly related to the acquisition of any whole or partial
    interest in a business and incurred within two years of the acquisition date, and (v) all gains or charges associated with the operation of any business as to which the Company acquired a whole or partial interest
    on or after January 1, 2022; provided, that with respect to the gains and charges referred
    to in sections (2)(iii) and (2)(iv) above, only gains or charges that individually or as part of a series of related items
    exceeded $10 million during the performance period are excluded. “Core Revenue Growth” is defined as
    sales from continuing operations calculated according to GAAP but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses; and (2) the
    impact of currency translation.
    Sales attributable to acquired businesses refers to sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary
    of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to divested product lines
    not considered discontinued operations. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference
    between (i) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired
    businesses); and (ii) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying
    current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. “Adjusted Free Cash Flow-to-Adjusted Net
    Income Ratio” or “Free Cash Flow Ratio” is defined as (A) the Company’s GAAP operating cash flow from
    continuing operations for the year
    ended December 31, 2022, less 2022 purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing operations (net of proceeds
    from the sale of property, plant and equipment); but excluding the cash flow impact
    of any discrete tax item in excess of $10 million or any other item that is excluded from Adjusted EPS, divided by (B) the
    Company’s Adjusted Net Income. “Adjusted Net Income” means the
    Company’s net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 as determined pursuant to GAAP,
    but excluding the same adjustment items reflected in the calculation of Adjusted
    EPS. “Adjusted Net Income” means the Company’s net income from continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2022 as determined pursuant to GAAP, but excluding the same adjustment items reflected in the calculation of
    Adjusted EPS. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 43 Back to Contents Compensation Governance The Committee recognizes that the success of our executive compensation
program over the long-term requires a robust framework of compensation governance. As a result, the Committee regularly reviews
external executive compensation practices and trends and incorporates best practices into our executive compensation program. Below
are highlights of our 2022 executive compensation program: WHAT WE DO WHAT WE DON’T DO Four-year vesting requirement for stock options; three-year performance period plus further two-year holding
    period for PSUs No tax gross-up provisions (except as applicable to management employees generally such as relocation policy) Incentive compensation programs feature multiple, different performance measures aligned with the Company’s
    strategic performance metrics No dividend/dividend equivalents paid on unvested equity awards Short-term and long-term performance metrics that balance our absolute performance and our relative performance
    versus peer companies No “single trigger” change of control benefits Rigorous, no-fault clawback policy that is triggered even in the absence of wrongdoing No active defined benefit pension program since 2003 Minimum one-year vesting requirement for 95% of shares granted under the Company’s stock plan No hedging of Danaher securities permitted Stock ownership requirements for all executive officers No long-term incentive compensation is denominated or paid in cash (other than PSU dividend accruals) Limited perquisites and a cap on CEO/CFO personal aircraft usage No above-market returns on deferred compensation plans Independent compensation consultant that performs no other services for the Company No overlapping performance metrics between short-term and long-term incentive compensation programs Risk Considerations Risk-taking is a necessary part of growing a business, and prudent
risk management is necessary to deliver long-term, sustainable shareholder value. The Committee believes that the Company’s
executive compensation program supports the objectives described above without encouraging inappropriate or excessive risk-taking.
In reaching this conclusion, the Committee considered in particular the following risk-mitigation attributes of our 2022 executive
compensation program. ATTRIBUTE KEY
    RISK MITIGATING EFFECT • Emphasis
        on long-term, equity-based compensation • Four-year
        vesting requirement for stock options, and three-year performance period plus further two-year mandatory holding period
        for PSUs • Rigorous,
        no-fault clawback policy that is triggered even in the absence of wrongdoing • Discourages
        risk-taking that produces short-term results at the expense of building long-term shareholder value • Helps
        ensure executives realize their compensation over a time horizon consistent with achieving long-term shareholder value • Helps
        deter inappropriate actions and decisions that could harm Danaher and its key stakeholders • Incentive
    compensation programs feature multiple, complementary performance measures aligned with business strategy • Mitigates
    incentive to over-perform with respect to any particular metric at the expense of other metrics • Cap
    on annual cash incentive compensation plan payments and on number of shares that may be earned under equity awards • Mitigates
    incentive to over-perform with respect to any particular performance period at the expense of future periods • Stock
        ownership requirements for all executive officers • No
        hedging of Danaher securities permitted • Aligns
    executives’ economic interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders • Annual
    cash incentive compensation awards are subject to Compensation Committee discretion • Mitigates
        risks associated with a strictly formulaic program, which could unintentionally incentivize an undue focus on certain
        performance metrics or encourage imprudent risk taking • Provides
        Compensation Committee the opportunity as appropriate to adjust awards based on how results are achieved • Independent
    compensation consultant • Helps
    ensure advice will not be influenced by conflicts of interest 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 44 Back to Contents Analysis of 2022 Named Executive Officer Compensation Overview In determining the appropriate mix and amount of compensation elements
for each NEO for 2022, the Committee considered the factors referred to under “– Named Executive Officer Compensation
Framework” (without assigning any particular weight to any factor), exercised its judgment and adopted the compensation elements
described above under “Executive Summary –2022 Executive Compensation.” The graphics below illustrate, for Mr.
Blair and separately for the other NEOs in aggregate, the percentage of 2022 compensation that each element of compensation accounted
for (based on the amounts reported in the 2022 Summary Compensation Table): Amounts may not total 100% due to rounding Long-Term Incentive Awards Target Award Values In February 2022, the Committee subjectively determined the target
dollar value of annual equity compensation to be delivered to each NEO in 2022, taking into account the following factors (none
of which was assigned a particular weight by the Committee): • the relative complexity and importance of the
    officer’s position; • the officer’s performance record and potential to contribute
    to future Company performance and assume additional leadership responsibility; • the risk/reward ratio of the award amount compared to the length
    of the related vesting and holding provisions, including the fact that the combined vesting and holding periods applicable
    to our executive awards are longer than typical for our peer group; • the amount of equity compensation necessary to provide sufficient
    retention value and long-term performance incentives in light of (1) compensation levels within the Company’s peer group,
    and (2) the officer’s historical compensation; • the competitive demand for our executives; and • the lack of a defined benefit pension plan for Danaher executives,
    and therefore the significance of long-term incentive awards as a capital accumulation opportunity. In determining Mr. Blair’s annual equity compensation in February
2022, the Committee considered in particular Mr. Blair’s effective leadership during the pandemic; the Company’s strong
financial and operational performance during his tenure; and his progress in further refining and improving the Company’s strategy
planning and development processes. Equity Award Mix With respect to each of the NEO 2022 annual equity awards, one-half
of the target award value was delivered as stock options and one-half as PSUs (please see “Grants of Plan-Based Awards”
table for the grant date fair value of the awards granted to each NEO). The Committee believes that the combination of stock options
and PSUs effectively balances the goals of incentivizing and rewarding shareholder value creation while supporting our talent retention
objectives: • Stock options and PSUs inherently incentivize shareholder value creation,
    since option holders realize no value unless our stock price rises after the option grant date and the value of PSUs is tied
    directly to the Company’s relative TSR performance. • Our 2022 NEO stock options vest over four years and our 2022 NEO
    PSUs are subject to a three-year performance period and a further two-year holding period. In aggregate, these periods promote
    stability and encourage officers to take a long-term view of our performance. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 45 Back to Contents • Effective in 2022, the Committee shortened the
    vesting period for executive stock options to four years. The Committee continually assesses the effectiveness of our executive
    compensation program, and concluded that a four-year vesting period for stock options most effectively balances (1) retention
    considerations in an increasingly competitive market for executive talent, and (2) the traditional, long-term focus of our
    executive compensation program. • The Committee believes our stock option award
    program in particular has contributed significantly to our strong performance record, which in turn has generally made our
    stock option awards valuable over the long-term and highly effective in recruiting, motivating and retaining highly-skilled
    officers. PSU Performance Criteria The executive officer PSUs granted in 2022 are subject to two performance
criteria: RELATIVE TSR The number of shares of Common Stock that vest pursuant to the PSU
award is based primarily on the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) ranking relative to the S&P 500 Index over an
approximately three-year performance period. The Committee established threshold, target and maximum relative TSR performance levels
and established a payout percentage curve that relates each level of performance to a payout expressed as a percentage of the target
PSUs, as illustrated in the table below: Performance Level (Relative TSR Rank Within S&P 500 Index) Payout Percentage Below 35 th percentile 0% 35 th percentile 50% 55 th percentile 100% 75 th percentile or above 200% The payout percentages for performance between the performance levels
indicated above are determined by linear interpolation. The Committee selected the S&P 500 Index as the relative TSR comparator
group because the index consists of a broad and stable group of companies that represents investors’ alternative capital
investment opportunities, reinforcing the linkage between our executive compensation program and the long-term interests of our
shareholders. ROIC The Company’s three-year average ROIC performance beginning
with the year of grant, compared to the Company’s ROIC for the year immediately preceding the year of grant (the “baseline
year”), can increase or decrease the number of shares that would otherwise vest by 10% (but cannot cause the payout percentage
to exceed 200%), as illustrated in the table below: Three-Year Average ROIC Change (2) (Compared to Baseline Year ROIC) ROIC Modifier Factor At or above + 200 basis points 110% Below + 200 basis points and above zero basis points 100% At or below zero basis points 90% (2) “Three-Year Average
    ROIC Change” means (1) the quotient of (a) the Company’s Adjusted Net Income for the three-year ROIC performance
    period divided by three, divided by (b) the Company’s Adjusted Invested Capital for the ROIC performance period, less
    (2) the quotient of (x) the Company’s Adjusted Net Income for the year immediately preceding the date of grant (the
    “baseline year”), divided by (y) the Company’s Adjusted Invested Capital for the baseline year. “Adjusted
    Invested Capital” means the average of the quarter-end balances for each fiscal quarter of the ROIC performance period
    of (a) the sum of (i) the Company’s GAAP total stockholders’ equity and (ii) the Company’s GAAP total short-term
    and long-term debt; less (b) the Company’s GAAP cash and cash equivalents; but excluding in all cases the impact
    of (1) any business acquisition by the Company for a purchase price equal to or greater than $250 million and consummated
    during the ROIC performance period, (2) any business sale, divestiture or disposition by the Company during the ROIC performance
    period, and (3) all Company investments in marketable or non-marketable securities that are consummated during the ROIC performance
    period. “Adjusted Net Income” is calculated in a manner similar to the definition set forth in the preceding footnote,
    except that (i) only transaction costs and operating gains/charges associated with acquisitions consummated during the ROIC
    performance period with a purchase price equal to or greater than $250 million are excluded, (ii) gains/charges associated
    with discontinued operations are not excluded, and (iii) gains/ charges related to Company strategic investments as well as
    all after-tax interest expense are excluded. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company’s absolute TSR performance
for the period is negative no more than 100% of the target PSUs will vest (regardless of how strong the Company’s performance
is on a relative basis), and if the Company’s absolute TSR performance for the period is positive, a minimum of 25% of the
target PSUs will vest. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 46 Back to Contents VESTING AND HOLDING PERIOD With respect to the PSUs granted in 2022, any PSUs that vest following
the three-year performance period are subject to an additional two-year holding period and are paid out in shares of Company Common
Stock following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the performance period. Any dividends paid on the Company’s
Common Stock during the performance period are credited to PSU accounts, but are only paid out (in cash) to the extent the underlying
PSUs vest based on performance and are not paid until the shares underlying the vested PSUs are issued. PSUs Earned for 2020-2022 Performance Period PSUs for the 2020-2022 performance period, which ended December 31,
2022, were earned and certified in February 2023 based on an earned payout percentage of 200%, resulting from the Company’s
three-year absolute TSR of 64.58% ranking in the 84 th percentile relative to the TSRs of the companies in the S&P
500 Index as of the beginning of the performance period (February 24, 2020). The Company’s Three-Year Average ROIC Change
with respect to these PSUs was +469 basis points, but because the ROIC Modifier Factor cannot increase the earned payout percentage
above 200%, it had no impact on the earned payout percentage. These PSUs remain subject to a further mandatory holding period that
runs through 2024. Annual Incentive Awards Overview The diagram below illustrates the 2022 annual incentive award opportunities
the Committee determined for the Company’s NEOs in May 2022 under the Omnibus Plan, each element of which is further described
below. Target Bonus Percentage and Personal Payout Percentage In May 2022, the Committee established NEO target bonus percentages
(as a multiple of base salary) and the personal performance objectives described below, including quantitative and qualitative
objectives as well as objectives based on financial and non-financial measures. The Committee did not assign a particular weighting
to any of the objectives. The Committee set the quantitative objectives at levels that, while achievable, would in its opinion
require personal performance appreciably above the executive’s prior year performance level. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 47 Back to Contents Executive Officer Target Bonus Percentage 2022 Personal Performance Objectives Rainer M. Blair President and Chief Executive Officer 200% The personal performance objectives for Mr. Blair consisted of qualitative goals with respect to the Company’s associate
    diversity representation; CEO succession planning process; senior talent acquisition; strategy (overall and with respect to key businesses
    and functions); portfolio optimization; the Company’s science and technology capabilities and positioning; and capital allocation
    and deployment. Matthew R. McGrew Executive Vice President and CFO 125% Consisted of the degree of Danaher’s year-over-year core revenue growth, operating profit margin expansion, earnings per
    share growth and free cash flow growth; quantitative goals with respect to the finance organization’s associate engagement;
    and goals with respect to the Company’s associate diversity representation and inclusion; finance leader development and succession
    planning; strengthening talent management and development in the finance organization; strengthening finance department operational
    process and leverage of DBS; cultivation and execution of acquisition opportunities; and sustainability strategy. Jennifer Honeycutt Executive Vice President 125% Consisted of the degree of year-over-year improvement in core revenue, operating profit margin and working capital turnover for
    her business units; return-on-invested-capital performance achieved with respect to acquisitions by her business units; quantitative
    goals for her business units relating to turnover rate, internal fill rate, associate engagement, talent development and succession
    planning, diversity representation, on-time delivery, manufacturing quality and capital deployment; and qualitative goals relating
    to strategic initiatives and sustainability strategy. Joakim Weidemanis Executive Vice President 125% Consisted of the degree of year-over-year improvement in core revenue, operating profit margin and working capital turnover for
    his business units; return-on-invested-capital performance achieved with respect to acquisitions by his business units; quantitative
    goals for his business units relating to turnover rate, internal fill rate, associate engagement, talent development and succession
    planning, diversity representation, on-time delivery, manufacturing quality and capital deployment; and qualitative goals relating
    to strategic initiatives, innovation and science, technology and digital organization and capabilities. Jose-Carlos
Gutierrez-Ramos Senior Vice President and Chief Science Officer 115% Consisted of goals with respect to the Company’s science and technology strategy; the leadership of the Company’s
    Scientific Advisory Board and support for the Board’s Science and Technology Committee; the Company’s science and technology
    culture and community; science and technology talent recruitment; capital allocation; and innovation-driven collaboration. DETERMINING TARGET BONUS PERCENTAGE In determining the target bonus percentage for each NEO, the Committee considered the relative complexity and
importance of the executive’s position and the amount of annual cash incentive compensation that peer companies typically pay to
executives serving in comparable roles. With respect to Mr. Blair in particular, although the Committee did not target the performance-based
portion of the CEO’s annual cash compensation at any particular percentage of total annual cash compensation, the Committee strategically
set the base salary at a level lower, and target annual bonus opportunity at a level higher, than typical among the Company’s peer
companies to help ensure that the CEO’s annual cash compensation is highly performance-based. DETERMINING PERSONAL PAYOUT PERCENTAGE Following the end of 2022, the Committee used its judgment and determined for each NEO a Personal Payout Percentage
between 0% and 200%. The Committee believes that its ability to exercise discretion in connection with the annual executive cash incentive
compensation awards is an important element in reaching balanced compensation decisions that are consistent with our strategy, reward
both current year performance and sustained long-term value creation, and reward achievements that advance our sustainability strategy.
The Committee’s ability to exercise discretion: • helps mitigate the risks associated with a rigid and strictly formulaic compensation program, which could
    unintentionally create incentives for our executives to focus only on certain performance metrics or encourage imprudent risk taking; • gives the Committee flexibility to address changes in economic conditions and our operating environment that occur during the
    performance period; and • allows the Committee to adjust compensation based on factors that would not be appropriately reflected by a strictly formulaic
    approach focused solely on Company performance, such as advancing sustainability-related goals, championing Danaher’s culture
    and values and recognition of individual performance levels. Without assigning any particular weight to any individual factor, the Committee took into account the executive’s
execution against their personal performance objectives for the year, the executive’s performance with respect to each of the Company’s
five “Core Behaviors” (which are a set of standards and behaviors that Danaher associates are expected to aspire to and are
assessed against), the executive’s overall performance for the year, the size of the Company Payout Percentage for the year, 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 48 Back to Contents and the amount of annual cash incentive compensation that peer companies typically pay to executives serving
in comparable roles. Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to the executive officer team’s 2022 performance as a whole the
Committee considered in particular the Company’s 2022 financial performance; the Company’s progress toward separating its EAS business
to create a separate, publicly-traded company; and the Company’s proactiveness during the year in identifying and executing upon
opportunities to invest in the Company’s future financial and competitive positioning. The average Personal Payout Percentage of
the NEOs (other than Mr. Blair) was 154%. The Company awarded Mr. Blair a Personal Payout Percentage of 160% for 2022, based primarily on the Company’s
financial and operational performance; progress toward its DE+I representation objectives; progress toward separating its EAS business
to create a separate, publicly-traded company; and progress in further enhancing the Company’s innovation and strategy development
processes, strategic direction and science and technology organization and capabilities. Company Payout Percentage The Company Payout Percentage is formulaic, based on the Company’s 2022 performance against the Adjusted
EPS, Free Cash Flow Ratio and Core Revenue Growth metrics described above and below and in Appendix A (the “Metrics”). The
Committee weights Adjusted EPS most heavily in the formula because it believes Adjusted EPS correlates strongly with shareholder returns,
particularly since Adjusted EPS is calculated in a manner that focuses on gains and charges the Committee believes are most directly
related to Company operating performance during the period. The Committee also uses the Free Cash Flow Ratio to help validate the quality
of the Company’s earnings, and Core Revenue Growth to incentivize an appropriate balance between profitability and growth. For each of the Metrics, the Committee established threshold, target and maximum levels of Company performance,
as well as a payout percentage curve that related each level of performance to a payout expressed as a percentage of target bonus. The
payout percentage was 0% for below-threshold performance, 50% for threshold performance, 100% for target performance and 200% for performance
that equaled or exceeded the maximum. The payout percentages for performance between threshold and target, or between target and maximum,
respectively, were determined by linear interpolation. In determining the target performance level and payout percentage curve for the Metrics, the Committee considered
historical performance data for the Company and its peer group, analyst estimates for the Company’s peer group, the Company’s
annual budget and macroeconomic/end-market trends. For each Metric, the Committee set the performance target at a level it believed would
represent attractive financial performance within our industry and would require a high (but achievable) level of Company performance,
while requiring what it believed would be outstanding performance to achieve the maximum payout level. Following the end of 2022, the Company Payout Percentage was calculated as follows: 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 49 Back to Contents In evaluating the 2022 Company Payout Percentage, the Committee noted that the number of COVID-19 test cartridges
actually sold by the Company in 2022 exceeded the level the Committee assumed when it set the Adjusted EPS and Core Revenue Growth target
levels in May 2022. Taking this into consideration, the Committee exercised its negative discretion to reduce the 2022 Company Payout
Percentage from 1.78 to 1.64 (which is the Company Payout Percentage the Committee determined would have resulted if actual 2022 results
had matched the assumed levels of cartridge sales). Composite Payout Percentage The Company Payout Percentage and Personal Payout Percentage were calculated for each NEO, weighted accordingly
and added to yield the officer’s Composite Payout Percentage. The Composite Payout Percentage was multiplied by the NEO’s
target bonus amount to yield the executive’s award amount for the year. The 2022 annual cash incentive compensation awards for
each of the NEOs are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table. Base Salaries The Committee typically reviews base salaries for executive officers in February of each year and in connection
with promotions and new hires. In February 2022, the Committee subjectively determined 2022 base salaries for the NEOs. In each case
the Committee used the officer’s prior base salary as the initial basis of consideration and then considered the individual factors
described under “– Named Executive Officer Compensation Framework,” focusing on the relative complexity and importance
of the executive’s role within Danaher, the market value of the executive’s role and the executive’s performance in
the prior year (without giving specific weight to any particular factor). Given that base salary is one of the elements in the formula
for determining annual cash incentive compensation, the Committee also considered how changes in base salary would impact annual cash
incentive compensation. Other Compensation Severance Benefits We have entered into Proprietary Interest Agreements with each of our NEOs that include post-employment restrictive
covenant obligations. Danaher’s Senior Leader Severance Pay Plan, which each of the NEOs participates in, provides for severance
payments under certain circumstances. Mr. Blair’s Proprietary Interest Agreement entitles him to certain additional cash payments
if the Company terminates his employment without cause. We believe the post-employment restrictive covenant obligations included in these
agreements are critical in protecting our proprietary assets, and that the severance payments payable upon a termination without cause
are generally commensurate with the severance rights our peers offer executives in comparable roles. There is no change-in-control provision
in the Senior Leader Severance Pay Plan or in any NEO employment agreement. EDIP, ECP and DCP As discussed in more detail under “Summary of Employment Agreements and Plans – Supplemental Retirement
Program,” each NEO (1) participates in either the Amended and Restated Executive Deferred Incentive Program (“EDIP”),
or the Excess Contribution Program (“ECP”), and (2) is eligible to participate in the voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan
(“DCP”): • The EDIP and ECP are each non-qualified, unfunded excess contribution programs available to selected members
    of our management. We use these programs to tax-effectively contribute amounts to executives’ and other participants’
    retirement accounts and provide an opportunity to realize tax-deferred, market-based notional investment growth on these contributions. • The DCP allows each participant to voluntarily defer, on a pre-tax basis, up to 85% of their salary and/or up to 85% of their
    non-equity annual incentive compensation with respect to a given plan year. The DCP gives our executives and other participants an
    opportunity to defer taxes on cash compensation and realize tax-deferred, market-based notional investment growth on their deferrals. Other Benefits and Perquisites All of our executives are eligible to participate in our U.S. employee benefit plans, including our group medical,
dental, vision, disability, accidental death and dismemberment, life insurance, flexible spending and 401(k) plans. These plans are generally
available to all U.S. salaried employees and do not discriminate in favor of executive officers. In addition, the Committee makes certain
perquisites available to the NEOs; please see the footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table for additional details. The Committee has
also adopted a policy prohibiting any tax reimbursement or gross-up provisions in our executive compensation program (except under a
policy applicable to management employees generally such as a relocation policy). 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 50 Back to Contents Peer Group Compensation Analysis The Committee does not target a specific competitive position versus the market or peer companies in determining
the compensation of our executives because in light of the Company’s diverse mix of businesses, strict targeting of a specified
compensation posture would not appropriately reflect the unique nature of our business portfolio or the degree of difficulty in leading
the Company and key businesses and functions. However, the Committee believes it is important to clearly understand the relevant market
for executive talent to inform its decision-making and ensure that our executive compensation program supports our recruitment and retention
needs and is fair and efficient. As a result, the Committee has worked with FW Cook to develop a peer group for purposes of assessing
competitive compensation practices, and periodically reviews compensation data for the peer group derived from publicly filed proxy statements.
The Committee periodically reviews the companies included in the peer group to ensure that the peer group remains appropriate. Executive Compensation Peer Group Prior to September 2022 Prior to September 2022, the Company’s peer group (for purposes of all 2022 executive compensation decisions)
consisted of the companies set forth below: 3M Company Biogen Inc. Johnson & Johnson Abbott Laboratories Boston Scientific Corporation Medtronic Inc. Amgen Inc. Ecolab Inc. Roper Corporation Baxter International, Inc. Honeywell International Inc. Stryker Corporation Becton Dickinson & Co. Illinois Tool Works Inc. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. The Committee selected companies for inclusion in this peer group based on (1) the extent to which they compete
with us in one or more lines of business, for executive talent and for investors, and (2) comparability of revenues, market capitalization,
net income, total assets and number of employees. As of September 2021 and based on Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ database, Danaher’s
ranking within this peer group was 59 th percentile for revenue, 93 rd percentile for market capitalization, 68 th percentile for net income (from continuing operations excluding extraordinary items), 88 th percentile for total assets
and 56 th percentile for employees. Executive Compensation Peer Group as of September 2022 The Committee periodically reviews the companies included in the peer group to ensure that the peer group remains
appropriate. In September 2022, the Committee evaluated the existing peer group with the assistance of FW Cook (using the same selection
criteria described above) and replaced Biogen Inc., Illinois Tool Works Inc., and Roper Corporation with AbbVie Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb
Company, Eli Lilly and Company, and IQVIA Holdings Inc. The Committee made these updates to the peer group to better reflect the Company’s
current size and portfolio of businesses. Set forth below is the Company’s peer group as of September 2022: 3M Company Boston Scientific Corporation IQVIA Holdings Inc. Abbott Laboratories Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Johnson & Johnson AbbVie Inc. Ecolab Inc. Medtronic Inc. Amgen Inc. Eli Lilly and Company Stryker Corporation Baxter International, Inc.

    PERCENTILE RANK 52% 78% 64% 70% 60% The peer group compensation data that the Committee reviewed in 2022 in connection with its named executive
officer compensation decisions estimated the 25 th , median and 75 th percentile positions among our peers with respect
to base salary, annual cash incentive compensation (target and actual), total annual cash compensation (target and actual), long-term
incentive compensation, total direct compensation (target and actual), all other compensation, annual change in pension value and above-market
interest on non-qualified deferred compensation, and actual total compensation, in each case with respect to each respective NEO position. Named Executive Officer Compensation Framework Danaher’s compensation program is grounded on the principle that each executive must consistently demonstrate
exceptional personal performance in order to remain a Danaher executive. Within the framework of this principle and the other objectives
discussed above, the Committee exercises its judgment in making executive compensation decisions. The factors that generally shape particular
executive compensation decisions (none of which are assigned any particular weight by the Committee) are the following: • The relative complexity and importance of the executive’s position
    within Danaher. To ensure that the most senior executives are held most accountable for long-term operating results
    and changes in shareholder value, the Committee believes that both the amount and “at-risk” nature of compensation should
    increase with the relative complexity and significance of an executive’s position. • The executive’s record of performance, long-term leadership
potential and tenure. • Danaher’s performance. Our cash incentive compensation varies annually
    to reflect near-term changes in operating and financial results. Our long-term compensation is closely aligned with long-term shareholder
    value creation, both by tying the ultimate value of the awards to long-term shareholder returns and because of the length of time
    executives are required to hold the awards before realizing their value. • Our assessment of pay levels and practices in the competitive marketplace. The
    Committee considers market practice in determining pay levels and compensation design to ensure that our costs are sustainable relative
    to peers and compensation is appropriately positioned to attract and retain talented executives. As noted above, the market for executive-level
    talent is highly competitive. We also have a history of successfully applying the Danaher Business System, or DBS, to deliver strong
    operating performance and create shareholder value, and we devote significant resources to training our executives in DBS. As a result
    of these factors, we believe that our executives are particularly valued by other companies, which creates a high degree of retention
    risk. The philosophy and goals of our compensation program have remained consistent over time, although the Committee
considers the factors above within the context of the then-prevailing economic environment and may adjust the terms and/or amounts of
compensation accordingly so that they continue to support our objectives. For a description of the role of the Company’s executives and the Committee’s independent compensation
consultant in the executive compensation process, please see “Corporate Governance – Board of Directors and Committees of
the Board – Compensation Committee.” 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 52 Back to Contents Other Compensation Policies and Information Long-Term Incentive Compensation Grant Practices Equity awards are granted under Danaher’s Omnibus Plan, which is described in “Summary of Employment
Agreements and Plans – 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan.” Executive equity awards are typically granted as of one of the Company’s
four, standardized grant dates during the year, and may also be granted at the time of an executive hire or promotion or upon identification
of a specific retention concern. The grant date is either the date of grant approval or a specified date subsequent to the approval date.
The timing of equity awards has not been coordinated with the release of material non-public information. The Committee’s general
practice is to approve annual equity awards to executive officers at the Committee’s regularly scheduled meeting in February, when
the Committee reviews the performance of the executive officers and typically determines most or all of the other components of executive
compensation. The target dollar value attributable to PSUs and RSUs, as applicable, has been translated into a target number
of PSUs or RSUs, as applicable, based on fair market value. Prior to 2021, the target dollar value attributable to stock options was
translated into a number of stock options based on a modified Black Scholes calculation that utilized a multi-day average closing price
and an assumed ten-year term. Beginning with the equity awards granted in February 2021, the modified Black Scholes value was replaced
with the actual Black Scholes value used in the Company’s financial statements with respect to the particular grant. The exercise
price for stock option awards granted under the Omnibus Plan equals the closing price of Danaher’s Common Stock on the date of
grant (or on the immediately preceding trading day if the date of grant is not a trading day). Since the valuation methodologies used
in 2020 are not the same as the FASB ASC Topic 718 grant date fair value used for accounting purposes, in that year the equity award
target dollar values are not identical to the equity award grant date fair values reflected in the Summary Compensation Table and other
compensation tables. Stock Ownership-Related Policies Stock Ownership Requirements To further align management and shareholder interests and discourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking,
our stock ownership policy requires each executive officer to obtain a substantial equity stake in Danaher within five years of their
appointment to an executive position, as follows: Title Stock Ownership Multiple Chief Executive Officer 6 times base salary Executive Vice President 3 times base salary Senior Vice President 2 times base salary What Counts as Ownership: What Does Not Count as Ownership: • Shares in which the executive or their spouse or child
    has a direct or indirect interest • Notional shares of Danaher stock in the EDIP, ECP or
    DCP • Shares held in a 401(k) plan • Unvested RSUs • Vested PSUs • Unexercised stock options • Unvested PSUs Once an executive officer has acquired a number of Company shares that satisfies the applicable ownership multiple,
such number of shares then becomes the officer’s minimum ownership requirement (even if the officer’s salary increases or
the fair market value of such shares subsequently changes) until the officer is promoted to a higher level. Each NEO was in compliance
with the stock ownership requirements as of December 31, 2022. Pledging Policy Danaher’s Board has adopted a policy that prohibits any director or executive officer from pledging as
security under any obligation any shares of Danaher Common Stock that the director or officer directly or indirectly owns and controls
(other than shares pledged as of the date the policy was adopted), and provides that pledged shares of Danaher Common Stock do not count
toward Danaher’s stock ownership requirements. No NEO has pledged any shares of Danaher Common Stock. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 53 Back to Contents Hedging Policy Under our insider trading policy, Danaher directors and employees (including executive officers) are prohibited
from engaging in short sales of Danaher Common Stock, transactions in any derivative of a Danaher security (including, but not limited
to, buying or selling puts, calls or other options (except for instruments granted under a Danaher equity compensation plan)) or any
other forms of hedging transactions with respect to Danaher securities. Recoupment Policy To further discourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking, the Committee has adopted a rigorous, “no-fault”
recoupment (or clawback) policy applicable to Danaher’s executive officers, other individuals who serve on the Danaher Leadership
Team and certain other employees (the “covered persons”). Under the policy, in the event of a material restatement of Danaher’s
consolidated financial statements (other than any restatement required pursuant to a change in applicable accounting rules), Danaher’s
Board may, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent it determines that it is in Danaher’s best interests to do so, in addition
to all other remedies available to Danaher require reimbursement or payment to Danaher of: • the portion of any annual incentive compensation payment awarded to any covered person within the three year
    period prior to the date such material restatement is first publicly disclosed that would not have been awarded had the consolidated
    financial statements that are the subject of such restatement been correctly stated (except that the Board has the right to require
    reimbursement of the entire amount of any such annual incentive compensation payment from any covered person whose fraud or other
    intentional misconduct in the Board’s judgment alone or with others caused such restatement); and • all gains from equity awards realized by any covered person during the twelve-month period immediately following the original
    filing of the consolidated financial statements that are the subject of such restatement, if the covered person’s fraud or
    other intentional misconduct in the Board’s judgment alone or with others caused such restatement. In addition, the stock plans in which Danaher’s executive officers participate contain provisions for
recovering awards upon certain circumstances. Under the terms of the Company’s Omnibus Plan, if an employee is terminated for gross
misconduct, the administrator may terminate up to all of the participant’s unexercised or unvested equity awards. In addition,
under the terms of each of the EDIP and the ECP, if the administrator determines that the circumstances of a participant’s termination
constitute gross misconduct, the administrator may determine that the participant’s vesting percentage is as low as zero with respect
to all balances that were contributed by Danaher. Regulatory Considerations. Section 162(m) generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation in excess of $1 million
paid for any fiscal year to certain executive officers. We review the tax impact of our executive compensation on the Company as well
as on the executive officers. In addition, we review the impact of our compensation programs against other considerations, such as accounting
impact, shareholder alignment, market competitiveness, effectiveness and perceived value to employees. Because many different factors
influence a well-rounded, comprehensive and effective executive compensation program, some of the compensation we provide to our executive
officers is not deductible under Section 162(m). Compensation Committee Report This report is not deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC
or subject to the SEC’s proxy rules or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act of 1934, and shall not be deemed to

    in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for equity grants made in the applicable year: With respect to stock options, the grant date
    fair value under FASB ASC Topic 718 has been calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, based on the following assumptions
    (and assuming no forfeitures): Name of Officer Date of Grant Risk-Free Interest Rate Stock Price Volatility Rate Dividend Yield Option Life Blair, McGrew, Honeycutt, Weidemanis, Gutierrez-Ramos February 24, 2022 1.94% 30.23% 0.37% 7.5 years Blair, McGrew, Honeycutt, Weidemanis February 24, 2021 1.08% 31.39% 0.38% 7.5 years Blair, Weidemanis May 15, 2020 0.54% 30.49% 0.44% 8.0 years Blair, McGrew, Weidemanis February 24, 2020 1.33% 23.09% 0.46% 8.0 years All stock awards reflected in the table above were granted
in the form of performance stock units (PSUs), except that Mr. Weidemanis’ May 2020 incremental stock award was granted in the form
of time-vesting restricted stock units (RSUs) and a portion of Dr. Gutierrez-Ramos’ 2022 stock award was granted in the form of RSUs.
With respect to RSUs, the grant date fair value under FASB ASC Topic 718 was calculated based on the number of shares of Common Stock
underlying the RSU, times the closing price of the Common Stock on the date of grant (but discounted to account for the fact that RSUs
do not accrue dividend rights prior to vesting and distribution). With respect to PSUs, the grant date fair value under FASB ASC Topic
718 has been calculated based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions and a Monte Carlo simulation valuation
model modified to reflect an illiquidity discount (as a result of the mandatory two-year post-vesting holding period), using the following
significant assumptions (since the performance criteria applicable to the performance stock units are considered a “market condition,”
footnote disclosure of the award’s potential maximum value is not required): Monte Carlo Simulation Illiquidity discount Name of Officer Date of Grant Danaher’s expected volatility Average volatility of peer group Risk-free interest rate Dividend yield Danaher’s expected volatility Risk-free interest rate Dividend yield Blair, McGrew, Honeycutt,

    benefit under the Cash Balance Plan of the Danaher Corporation & Subsidiaries Pension Plan (“Pension Plan”) declined
    by $4,679. The material assumptions used in quantifying the present value of the accumulated benefit at each of December 31, 2021
    and December 31, 2022 are as follows: an interest crediting rate (applied from the plan measurement date until normal retirement
    age) of 2.9% for the plan measurement date of December 31, 2021 and 3.5% for the plan measurement date of December 31, 2022; a retirement
    age of 65, which is normal retirement age under the Cash Balance Plan; payment of the accrued obligations in a lump sum upon retirement;
    and the discount rates as set forth in Note 16 to Danaher’s consolidated financial statements included in Danaher’s Annual
    Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Ms. Honeycutt is the only named executive officer with a balance in the
    Cash Balance Plan. We do not provide any above-market or preferential earnings on compensation that is deferred by any NEO. (4) The following table describes the elements of compensation included in “All Other

    Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) ranking relative to the S&P 500 Index over an approximately three-year performance
    period. Payout at 100% of the target level requires that the Company achieve above-median performance and rank at the 55th percentile
    of the S&P 500 Index, while the PSUs pay out at 200% for performance that equals or exceeds the 75 th percentile, 50%
    for performance at the 35 th percentile and zero percent for performance below the 35 th percentile. The payout
    percentages for performance between the performance levels are determined by linear interpolation. The Company’s three-year
    average ROIC beginning with the year of grant, compared to the Company’s ROIC for the immediately preceding year (the “baseline
    year”), can increase or decrease the number of shares that would otherwise vest by 10% (but cannot cause the payout percentage
    to exceed 200%). Notwithstanding the above, if the Company’s absolute TSR performance for the period is negative a maximum
    of 100% of the target PSUs will vest (regardless of how strong the Company’s performance is on a relative basis), and if the
    Company’s absolute TSR performance for the period is positive a minimum of 25% of the target PSUs will vest. Any PSUs that
    vest following the three-year performance period are subject to an additional two-year holding period and are paid out in shares
    of Company Common Stock following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the performance period. For purposes of this table,
    the number of PSU shares and payout value reported in the table reflect maximum-level performance for PSUs granted in 2021 and target-level
    performance for PSUs granted in 2022; the 2020 PSUs are addressed separately in Footnote 6 below. (6) The number of shares and market value reported in the table reflect actual performance,
    since the three-year performance period for these PSU awards has concluded. These PSU awards were subject to the performance criteria
    set forth in Footnote 5, vested when the Company’s Compensation Committee certified the level of performance achieved, and remain
    subject to a holding period that concludes on the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the applicable performance period. (7) The RSU award was granted subject to both time-based and performance-based vesting conditions
    and prior to December 31, 2022, Danaher’s Compensation Committee certified that the performance-based vesting conditions applicable
    to the award have been satisfied. Pursuant to the time-based vesting conditions, one-half of the award vests or vested on each of
    the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. (8) The option award was granted subject to time-based vesting conditions such that one-fifth
    of the award became or becomes exercisable on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date. (9) The RSU award was granted subject to time-based vesting conditions such that one-fifth
    of the award vests or vested on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date. (10) The option award was granted subject to time-based vesting conditions such that one-third
    of the award became or becomes exercisable on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. (11) The RSU award was granted subject to time-based vesting conditions such that one-third
    of the award vests or vested on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. (12) The RSU award was granted subject to time-based vesting conditions such that one-third
    of the award vests or vested on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 60 Back to Contents Option Exercises and Stock Vested During Fiscal 2022 The following table summarizes stock option exercises and the vesting of

officer would be entitled to receive upon termination of employment or in connection with a change-of-control of Danaher. The amounts
set forth below assume that the triggering event occurred on December 31, 2022. Where benefits are based on the market value of Danaher’s
Common Stock, we have used the closing price of Danaher’s Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on December 31, 2022 ($265.42 per
share). In addition to the amounts set forth below, upon any termination of employment each officer would also be entitled to: • receive all payments generally provided to salaried employees on a non-discriminatory basis upon termination, such as accrued salary, life insurance proceeds (for any termination caused by death), unused vacation and 401(k) Plan distributions; • potentially receive an annual cash incentive compensation award pursuant to the Omnibus Plan, since under the terms of the award a participant who remains employed through the end of the annual performance period is eligible for an award under the plan; • receive accrued, vested balances under the EDIP, ECP, DCP and the Cash Balance Plan, if applicable (provided that under the EDIP and the ECP, if the administrator determines that the circumstances of a participant’s termination constitute gross misconduct, the administrator may determine that the participant’s vesting percentage is as low as zero with respect to all balances that were contributed by Danaher); and • exercise vested stock options (provided that under the terms of the Omnibus Plan, if an employee is terminated for gross misconduct, the administrator may terminate up to all of the participant’s unexercised or unvested equity awards).

    assumes that upon a change-of-control of Danaher (as defined in the Omnibus Plan), Danaher’s Board does not accelerate the
    vesting of any unvested RSUs, PSUs or stock options held by the named executive officers. If a change-of-control had occurred as
    of December 31, 2022 and Danaher’s Board had allowed all of the unvested RSUs, PSUs and stock options held by the named executive
    officers to accelerate (which would be entirely at the Board’s discretion), the intrinsic value of the stock options, RSUs
    and PSUs held by these officers that would have been accelerated would have been as follows (no tax reimbursement or gross-up payments

accumulated benefits payable to Ms. Honeycutt under the Cash Balance Plan of the Danaher Corporation & Subsidiaries Pension
Plan (the “Cash Balance Plan”), which is the only defined benefit pension plan in which any of the named executive
officers participates. The Cash Balance Plan is part of the Danaher Corporation & Subsidiaries Pension Plan, a funded pension
plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). Prior to the inception of the Cash Balance
Plan in 1997, Danaher made annual contributions to the defined contribution retirement plans of substantially all of its United
States salaried employees, in an amount equal to 3% of the employee’s annual, eligible base salary. From 1997 through 2003,
in lieu of these contributions, Danaher credited the same level of contributions to the Cash Balance Plan for each covered employee.
As of December 31, 2003, the plan was frozen with respect to substantially all participants under the plan (including Ms. Honeycutt)
and no further contributions will be made with respect to such participants under the plan. All accrued benefits under the plan
for these participants became 100% vested as of such date. All account balances under the plan with respect to these participants
(including Ms. Honeycutt) now increase each year at a rate equal to the annual rate of interest on 30-year Treasury securities
for the month of November immediately preceding the applicable plan year. Upon termination of employment, a participant receives
their vested accrued benefit in cash or as an annuity (based on the participant’s election). 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 65 Back to Contents The material assumptions used in quantifying the present value of
the accumulated benefit at December 31, 2022 are as follows: an interest crediting rate (applied from the plan measurement date

of the accrued obligations in a lump sum upon retirement; and the discount rates as set forth in Note 16 to Danaher’s consolidated

    DCP at distribution are converted into shares of Danaher Common Stock and distributed to the participant at no additional
    cost. Under the EDIP, if a participant receives their distribution in shares of Danaher Common Stock, the participant’s
    balance is converted into shares of Danaher Common Stock and distributed to the participant at no additional cost. As such,
    the weighted-average exercise price in column (b) does not take these awards into account. (3) Consists of the Omnibus Plan (including the Non-Employee Directors’ Deferred

    Common Stock (except that any portion of a participant’s account that is subject to the Danaher Common Stock earnings
    rate must be distributed in shares of Danaher Common Stock). For purposes of this table, we have assumed that all EDIP balances
    as of December 31, 2022 would be distributed in Danaher Common Stock. (5) Consists of 45,384,731 shares available for future issuance under the Omnibus Plan

    account that is subject to the Danaher Common Stock earnings rate must be distributed in shares of Danaher Common Stock (all
    other balances are distributed in cash). 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 66 Back to Contents Pay Versus Performance The disclosure in this section shall not be deemed to be incorporated
by reference into any prior or subsequent filing by Danaher under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act of 1934, except
to the extent Danaher specifically incorporates it by reference therein. Provided below is the Company’s “pay versus performance”
disclosure as required pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act. As required by Item 402(v),
we have included: • A list of the most important measures that our Compensation Committee used in 2022 to link a measure
    of pay calculated in accordance with Item 402(v) (referred to as “compensation actually paid”, or “CAP”)
    to Company performance; • A table that compares the total compensation of our named executive officers’ (also known as NEOs) as presented
    in the Summary Compensation Table (“SCT”) to CAP and that compares CAP to specified performance measures; and • Graphs that describe: • the relationships between CAP and our cumulative total shareholder return (“TSR”), GAAP Net Income, and our
    Company selected measure, non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations (“Adjusted
    EPS”); and • the relationship between our TSR and the TSR of the S&P 500 Health Care Index (“Peer Group TSR”). Salary, Bonus, Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation, Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Earnings and All Other Compensation are each calculated in the same manner for purposes of both CAP and SCT.
There are two primary differences between the calculation of CAP and SCT total compensation: SCT Total CAP Pension Year over year change in the actuarial present value of pension benefits Current year service cost and any prior year service cost (if a plan amendment occurred during the year) Stock and Option Awards Grant date fair value of stock and option awards granted during the year Year over year change in the fair value of stock and option awards that are unvested as of the end of the year, or vested
    or were forfeited during the year (1) (1) Includes any dividends paid on equity awards in the fiscal year
    prior to the vesting date that are not otherwise reflected in the fair value of such award. This disclosure has been prepared in accordance with Item 402(v) and
does not necessarily reflect value actually realized by the executives or how our Committee evaluates compensation decisions in
light of Company or individual performance. In particular, our Committee has not used CAP as a basis for making executive compensation
decisions, nor does it use GAAP Net Income or Peer Group TSR for purposes of determining executive incentive compensation. Please
refer to our Compensation Discussion and Analysis on pages 40 to 54 for a discussion of our executive compensation program objectives
and the ways in which we align executive compensation with performance. Our Most Important Metrics Used
for Linking Pay and Performance. As required by Item 402(v), below are the most important metrics our Committee
used to link executive pay to performance for 2022. Our stock price performance, as reflected by our absolute TSR, directly impacts
the value of the equity compensation awards we grant to executive officers. Each of the other metrics below are used for purposes
of determining payouts under either our executive annual cash incentive compensation program or our executive PSU program. • Absolute TSR • Relative TSR compared to S&P 500 TSR • Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) • Adjusted Free Cash Flow to Adjusted Net Income Ratio (non-GAAP) • Core Revenue Growth (non-GAAP) Adjusted EPS is the most heavily weighted metric used to determine
Company performance under our executive annual cash incentive compensation program. The Committee weights Adjusted EPS most heavily
in the Company performance formula because it believes Adjusted EPS correlates strongly with shareholder returns, particularly
since Adjusted EPS is calculated in a manner that focuses on gains and charges the Committee believes are most directly related
to Company operating performance during the period. Accordingly, Adjusted EPS is the Company-selected measure included in the table
and graphs that follow. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 67 Back to Contents Pay Versus PerformanceTable. In

total compensation of Rainer M. Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and the annual total compensation of the median
of our employees other than Mr. Blair. The pay ratio set forth below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent
with applicable SEC rules. In light of the numerous different methodologies, assumptions, adjustments and estimates that companies
may apply as permitted under the SEC rules, this information should not be used as a basis for comparison between different companies. For 2022, our last completed fiscal year: • the annual total compensation of Mr. Blair, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table presented
    elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, was $20,196,027; • the annual total compensation of the median of all Danaher employees (other than Mr. Blair) was $64,979; and • the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Blair to the annual total compensation of the median of all other Company
    employees was 311 to 1. For purposes of the 2022 CEO pay ratio set forth above, we used the
same median employee identified with respect to our 2021 CEO pay ratio, as there has been no change in our employee population
or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 72 Back to Contents SUMMARY OF EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND PLANS Following is a description of (1) named executive officer employment-related
agreements, and (2) the cash incentive compensation, equity compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation and severance pay
plans in which Danaher’s named executive officers participate. Each of these plans allows the plan administrator to exercise
certain discretion in the administration of the plan, and as a result the plan administrator may administer the plan in a different
manner from period to period, or in a different manner with respect to different plan participants, in each case to the extent
permitted under the applicable plan. Employment Agreements Named Executive Officer Proprietary Interest
Agreements In connection with Mr. Blair’s promotion to the role of President
and CEO in 2020, Danaher and Mr. Blair entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement Regarding Competition and Protection of Proprietary
Interests (the “Blair Agreement”). Under the Blair Agreement, during and for two years after Mr. Blair’s employment
with us, subject to certain customary exceptions, he is prohibited from disclosing or improperly using any of our confidential information;
making any disparaging comments about us; competing with us; selling to or soliciting purchases from our customers and prospective customers
with respect to products and services about which he has particular knowledge; or hiring or soliciting any of our current or recent employees,
and during and for one year after his employment with us he is prohibited from working for any Danaher customers or vendors in any role
in which he would use or disclose or threaten to use or disclose any of our confidential information. In addition, with limited exceptions
all intellectual property that Mr. Blair develops in connection with his employment with us belongs to us. The Blair Agreement further
provides that if we terminate Mr. Blair’s employment without “cause” or if he terminates his employment for “good
reason” (each as defined in the Blair Agreement), he will be entitled to (1) a cash amount equal to twelve months of base salary
at the rate in effect on the date of termination (the “Termination Date,” and the year in which the Termination Date occurs
is referred to as the “Termination Year”), (2) the annual cash incentive compensation award for service in the calendar year
prior to the Termination Year, if it has not been paid prior to the Termination Date (the “Accrued Obligation”), (3) a cash
amount equal to his target annual cash incentive compensation award for the Termination Year, and (4) a cash amount equal to the product
of (x) his target annual cash incentive compensation award for the Termination Year, times (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days from the beginning of the Termination Year through the Termination Date, and the denominator of which is
365; provided in each case he signs and does not revoke a release of all claims. Any cash severance payments paid under any other Danaher
plan or agreement will diminish the severance payments under the Blair Agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis (except for the Accrued
Obligation). We have also entered into an agreement with each of the other
NEOs under which each such officer is subject to certain covenants designed to protect Danaher’s proprietary interests (each,
a “Proprietary Interest Agreement”). Except for differences in the duration of certain restrictive covenants, the
terms of such agreements are substantially the same. During and for specified periods after the officer’s employment with
us, subject to certain customary exceptions, the officer is prohibited from disclosing or improperly using any of our confidential
information; making any disparaging comments about us; competing with us; selling to or soliciting purchases from our customers
and prospective customers with respect to products and services about which the officer has particular knowledge; or hiring or
soliciting any of our current or recent employees. Each officer also agrees that with limited exceptions all intellectual property
that the officer develops in connection with the officer’s employment with us belongs to us. Certain of the agreements also
restrict interfering with our vendor relationships, and certain of the agreements prohibit the officer for a specified period
of time from working for any Danaher customers or vendors in any role in which the officer would use or disclose or threaten to
use or disclose any of our confidential information. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 73 Back to Contents Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification
and Insurance Danaher’s Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify
to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding
by reason of their service as a director or officer of Danaher, or by reason of serving at Danaher’s request as a director
or officer of any other entity, subject to certain exceptions. Danaher’s Bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights.
In addition, each of Danaher Corporation’s directors and executive officers has executed an indemnification agreement with
Danaher that provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. Danaher also has in effect directors and officers liability insurance
covering all of Danaher’s directors and officers. 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Danaher
(the “Administrator”) administers the Omnibus Plan. The following awards may be granted under the Omnibus Plan: stock
options, SARs, restricted stock, RSUs and other stock-based awards (including PSUs), as such terms are defined in the Omnibus
Plan, as well as cash-based awards (collectively, all such awards are referred to as “awards”). Award Limits 126,846,408 shares of Common Stock have been authorized for issuance
under the Omnibus Plan (the “Maximum Share Limit”). Under the terms of the plan, (1) each share of Common Stock subject
to a full value award and granted before February 28, 2017 counts against the Maximum Share Limit as one share of Common Stock,
(2) each share of Common Stock subject to a full value award and granted after February 28, 2017 counts against the Maximum Share
Limit as 3.56 shares of Common Stock, and (3) if after February 28, 2017 any full value award expires, is canceled, forfeited,
cash-settled, exchanged or assumed by a third party or terminates for any other reason, in each case without a distribution of
shares of Common Stock to the participant, each share of Common Stock available under that award is added back to the pool of
shares available for grant as 3.56 shares of Common Stock. The plan caps the number of shares of Common Stock that may be awarded
to any individual in any calendar year under options or SARs at 1,000,000 and under any other stock-based award at 500,000, provided
that this cap is doubled in the initial year of hire. Cash-based awards under the plan are subject to an annual limit of $10 million
(which amount is doubled in the initial year of hire) per employee participant. The plan also caps the annual cash and equity
compensation (based on grant date fair value) that may be awarded to any individual, non-management director at $800,000 ($1,300,000
for any non-management Board chair or vice chair (or similar role)). Prohibition on Share Recycling The following shares of Common Stock do not again become available
for awards or increase the number of shares available for grant under the plan: shares of Common Stock (1) tendered by the participant
or withheld by the Company in payment of the purchase price of an option or SAR, (2) tendered by the participant or withheld by
the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation under the plan, (3) repurchased by the Company with proceeds received from
the exercise of an option, or (4) subject to a SAR that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of that SAR upon
its exercise. Minimum Vesting Requirement All equity awards granted following the date of the Company’s
2017 annual meeting are subject to a minimum one-year vesting or performance requirement, except that (1) up to five percent (5%)
of the Maximum Share Limit may be issued without regard to this minimum vesting period, (2) this minimum vesting period does not
apply in the event of death, disability, retirement or other terminations of employment or service, and (3) the Administrator
may waive the minimum vesting requirement in the event of a substantial corporate change. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 74 Back to Contents Retirement and Other Terminations of Employment Subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Omnibus
Plan or the applicable award agreement (including the overall term of the award), in general: • upon retiring after reaching age 65, (1) a participant’s
    unvested options held for at least six months prior to retirement continue to vest and, together with any options that are
    vested as of the retirement date, remain outstanding and (once vested) may be exercised until the fifth anniversary of the
    retirement date (or the tenth anniversary with respect to grants made on or after January 1, 2022), (2) any RSUs that are

    continue to vest according to their terms, (3) for PSUs granted prior to January 1, 2022, the participant receives a prorated
    portion of the shares actually earned based on the Company’s performance over the performance period, and (4) for PSUs
    granted on or after January 1, 2022 and held for at least six months prior to retirement, the participant receives the shares
    actually earned based on the Company’s performance over the performance period; and • upon retiring after reaching age 55 and completing ten years of service
    with Danaher: • with respect to grants on or after February 23, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2022, (1) a pro rata portion
    of the participant’s unvested options held for at least six months prior to retirement continue to vest and, together

    fifth anniversary of the retirement date, (2) a pro rata portion of any RSUs that are unvested as of the retirement date continue
    to vest according to their terms, and (3) with respect to PSUs, the participant receives a prorated portion of the shares
    actually earned based on the Company’s performance over the performance period. • with respect to grants on or after January 1, 2022 and held for at least six months prior to retirement, (1) the participant’s
    unvested options continue to vest and, together with any options that are vested as of the retirement date, remain outstanding
    and (once vested) may be exercised until the fifth anniversary of the retirement date, (2) any RSUs that are unvested as of
    the retirement date continue to vest according to their terms, and (3) the participant receives the PSU shares actually earned
    based on the Company’s performance over the performance period. Upon terminations of employment other than retirement (as defined
under the Omnibus Plan), unless the Administrator determines otherwise any options or SARs that are vested as of a participant’s
termination of employment (including any options or SARs the vesting of which accelerates as a result of the participant’s
death) will remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of the award’s term or (1) 12 months after termination,
if the termination results from the participant’s death or disability, (2) in the Administrator’s discretion, at the
time of termination if the participant’s employment is terminated for gross misconduct, or (3) 90 days following the termination
date, in all other non-retirement situations. If an award survives for any period of time following termination of employment,
it will nonetheless terminate as of the date that the participant violates any post-employment covenant between Danaher and the
participant. In addition, upon termination of a participant’s employment or service due to death, generally (1) all of the
participant’s outstanding stock options granted under the Omnibus Plan become fully vested, (2) the vesting of a pro rata
portion of the participant’s outstanding RSUs is accelerated as of the date of death, and (3) with respect to PSUs as to
which the death occurs prior to conclusion of the performance period, the participant’s estate receives a pro rata portion
of the target number of shares underlying the PSUs. Recoupment All awards granted under the Omnibus Plan are subject to the
Company’s recoupment policy in the form approved by the administrator from time to time, if and to the extent the policy
applies according to its terms, as well as any recoupment terms required by applicable law. Term of Plan Unless the Board extends the plan’s term, the administrator
may not grant awards under the plan after May 9, 2027. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 75 Back to Contents Supplemental Retirement Program Company Contributions Danaher uses the Executive Deferred Incentive Program, or EDIP,
and the Excess Contribution Program, or ECP (which is a sub-plan under the 2007 Omnibus Plan) to provide supplemental retirement
benefits on a pre-tax basis in excess of qualified plan limitations to select management associates of Danaher and its subsidiaries
(including each of the named executive officers, as applicable). Prior to January 1, 2019, the EDIP was the sole plan used by
the Company to provide supplemental retirement benefits (and also served as a voluntary deferred compensation program). The ECP
became effective as of January 1, 2019 and prior to such date, EDIP participants made a one-time election to either continue participating
in the EDIP or participate in the ECP. All participants who join Danaher’s supplemental retirement program at or after January
1, 2019 receive Company contributions under the ECP. All amounts that Danaher contributes to a participant’s account in
the EDIP and ECP are deemed invested on a notional basis in Danaher Common Stock. If termination of an employee’s participation
in the EDIP or ECP resulted from the employee’s gross misconduct, the Administrator may reduce the employee’s vested
interest with respect to all Danaher contributions to as low as zero percent. EDIP At the beginning of each plan year, Danaher credits to the account
of each EDIP participant an amount equal to the product of (1) the sum of the participant’s base salary and target bonus
as of the end of the prior year; and (2) a percentage determined by the Administrator that is based on the participant’s
years of participation in the EDIP, namely 6% for employees who have participated in the EDIP for less than 10 years, 8% after
10 years of EDIP participation and 10% after 15 years of EDIP participation. A participant vests in the amounts that Danaher credits to their
EDIP account as follows: • If the participant has both reached age 55 and completed at least five years of service with Danaher
    or its subsidiaries, the participant immediately vests 100% in each Danaher contribution. • If the participant does not satisfy the conditions described under the preceding bullet, the participant’s vesting
    percentage is 10% for each full calendar year of participation in the EDIP (after the participant has first completed five
    years of participation in the EDIP). • If a participant dies while employed by Danaher, their vesting percentage equals 100%. ECP Under the ECP, on or about February 1 after the applicable year
of participation, Danaher credits to the account of each participant an excess matching contribution and excess non-elective contribution
based on the formulas in the Company’s 401(k) plan for matching and non-elective contributions. As a result, each participant
can receive the following contributions in the ECP: • a matching contribution to the ECP equal to the sum of (a) 100% of the amount deferred into the Danaher
    Deferred Compensation Plan, or DCP for the year of participation, up to 3% of the greater of (1) the participant’s compensation
    that is deferred into the DCP or (2) the participant’s compensation above the IRS compensation limit for qualified retirement
    plans (“match compensation”), plus (b) 50% of the amount deferred into the DCP for the year of participation in
    excess of 3%, but not in excess of 5%, of the participant’s match compensation; and • a non-elective contribution equal to 4% of the participant’s rate of base salary and target bonus amount as of December
    31 prior to the year of participation in excess of the IRS compensation limit for qualified retirement plans. A participant vests in the matching contribution in the ECP made
each year on the first anniversary after it is credited to the participant’s account. A participant vests in the non-elective
contribution in the ECP made each year on the later of the first anniversary after it is credited to the participant’s account,
or the date the participant has completed three years of service with Danaher. If a participant dies while employed by Danaher,
their vesting percentage equals 100%. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 76 Back to Contents Voluntary Deferrals Each DCP participant is permitted to voluntarily defer into the
program, on a pre-tax basis, up to 85% of their salary and/ or up to 85% of their non-equity incentive compensation with respect
to a given plan year. Notional earnings on amounts deferred under the program are credited to participant accounts based on the
market rate of return of the applicable benchmark investment alternatives offered under the program, which are generally the same
as the investment alternatives offered under our 401(k) Plan (except for any investment options that may only be offered under
the tax qualified 401(k) Plan). Each participant allocates the amounts the participant voluntarily defers among the available
investment alternatives. Participants may change their allocations at any time, provided that any portion of a participant’s
account that is subject to the Danaher Common Stock investment alternative must remain allocated to that investment alternative
until the account is distributed to the participant. Participants are at all times fully vested in amounts they voluntarily defer
into their DCP accounts. Distributions In general, a participant may not receive a distribution of their
vested EDIP account balance (including any amounts voluntarily deferred) until after their employment with Danaher terminates.
A participant generally may elect to receive a distribution of their DCP account balance following their termination of employment
or on a specified future date prior to their termination of employment. The following chart generally describes the timing and
manner of distribution of EDIP, ECP and DCP account balances: Name of Plan Timing of Beginning of Distribution Period of Distribution Form of Distribution EDIP Not 100% vested in Danaher contributions 6 months following termination Lump sum Participant may elect to receive distribution in cash, shares of Danaher Common Stock or a combination thereof

    Stock) 100% vested in Danaher contributions Participant may elect to begin receiving distributions immediately, 6 months, 1 year or 2 years following termination
    (generally, a distribution after a termination of employment is payable after a 6-month delay) Participant may elect lump sum, or if at least age 55, annual installments over two, five or ten years ECP Participant will begin receiving distributions immediately following termination. A six-month delay may apply if the participant
    is a “key employee” under applicable tax rules Lump sum Shares of Danaher common stock (for balances subject to the Danaher Common Stock investment alternative) or cash (for
    balances not subject to the Danaher Common Stock investment alternative) DCP Participant may elect to begin receiving distributions on the earlier of a fixed date or termination of employment. Distributions
    on a fixed date must be at least 3 years after the date of election. Distribution elections upon a termination of employment
    are the same as under the EDIP (a 6-month delay may apply to distributions on a termination of employment if the participant
    is a “key employee” under applicable tax rules) Participant may elect lump sum or annual installments over a period of up to 10 years All balances subject to the Danaher Common Stock investment alternative must be distributed in shares of Danaher Common
    Stock, and all other balances must be paid in cash Certain events, such as the participant’s death or an unforeseeable
emergency, may impact the timing of a distribution under the EDIP, the ECP or the DCP. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 77 Back to Contents General Under the EDIP, the ECP and the DCP, Danaher contributions and
amounts voluntarily deferred are unfunded and unsecured obligations of Danaher, receive no preferential standing and are subject
to the same risks as any of Danaher’s other general obligations. Senior Leader Severance Pay Plan Each of Danaher’s executive officers (in addition to certain
other categories of employees as specified in the plan) is entitled to certain benefits under Danaher’s Senior Leader Severance
Pay Plan. If a covered employee is terminated without “cause” (as defined below) and except in certain circumstances
as specified in the plan, subject to execution of Danaher’s standard form of release the employee is entitled to severance
equal to a minimum of three months of annual base salary plus an additional month for each year of service (provided that the

according to the normal payroll cycle, as well as the opportunity to continue coverage under specified welfare benefit plans of
the Company for the duration of the severance period at the same cost as an active employee in a position similar to that held
by the employee at termination. There is no change-in control provision in the Senior Leader Severance Pay Plan. To the extent
a covered employee is entitled to severance or other post-termination compensation pursuant to the terms of an individual agreement,
payments and benefits will only be provided under the plan to the extent they are not duplicative of the payments and benefits
provided under the individual agreement. Under the plan, “cause” is defined as (1) the employee’s
dishonesty, fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement, willful misconduct or gross negligence with respect to, or any other action
in willful disregard of the interests of, Danaher or its affiliates; (2) the employee’s conviction of, or pleading guilty
or no contest to (i) a felony, (ii) any misdemeanor (other than a traffic violation), or (iii) any other crime or activity that
would impair the employee’s ability to perform duties or impair the business reputation of Danaher or its affiliates; (3)
the employee’s willful failure or refusal to satisfactorily perform any duties assigned to the employee; (4) the employee’s
failure or refusal to comply with Company standards, policies or procedures, including without limitation the Code of Conduct
as amended from time to time; (5) the employee’s violation of any restrictive covenant agreement with Danaher or its affiliates;
(6) the employee’s engaging in any activity that is in conflict with the business purposes of Danaher or its affiliates
(as determined in the sole discretion of Danaher and its affiliates); or (7) a material misrepresentation or a breach of any of
the employee’s representations, obligations or agreements under the plan. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 78 Back to Contents PROPOSAL 3 Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Compensation In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking
our shareholders to vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive
officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. Our shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation occurs on an annual basis. As discussed in detail under the heading “Compensation
Discussion and Analysis,” our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain executives with the leadership
skills, attributes and experience necessary to succeed in an enterprise with Danaher’s size, diversity and global footprint;
motivate executives to demonstrate exceptional personal performance and perform consistently at or above the levels that we expect,
over the long-term and through a range of economic cycles; and link compensation to the achievement of goals and objectives that
we believe best correlate with the creation of long-term shareholder value. We believe our executive compensation program has been highly
effective in achieving these objectives, both in 2022 and historically: • 2022 Performance . In 2022, as the world faced the evolution of COVID-19 from pandemic
    toward endemic status, widespread inflation and supply chain disruptions and economic slowdowns across many major geographies,
    Danaher remained focused on growing its business in the near-term while continuing to invest in long-term growth. Specifically,
    in 2022 Danaher: • Continued to evolve its portfolio by announcing the intention to separate its Environmental & Applied
    Solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2023 to create a separate, publicly traded company (to be known as Veralto Corporation),
    which will further advance Danaher’s science and technology transformation. • Invested aggressively in future growth, including investments of approximately $1.7 billion in research and development,
    $1.2 billion in acquisitions and strategic investments and $1.2 billion in capital expenditures. • Returned approximately $700 million to common shareholders through cash dividends (marking the 30 th year in
    a row Danaher has paid a dividend on its common shares). • Increased revenues by 7% and net earnings attributable to common shareholders by 13.5% on a year-over-year basis, and
    generated more than $8 billion of operating cash flow. • Long-Term Performance . Danaher’s compounded, average annual shareholder return
    has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over each of the last two, three, five-, ten-, fifteen-, twenty- and twenty-five year
    periods. In addition, Danaher is the only company in its peer group whose total shareholder return outperformed the S&P
    500 Index: • over every rolling 3-year period from and including 1998-2022; and • by more than 600 basis points over every rolling 3-year period from and including 2002-2022. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 79 Back to Contents Our executive compensation program operates within a strong framework
of compensation governance. Our Compensation Committee regularly reviews external executive compensation practices and trends
and incorporated best practices into our 2022 executive compensation program: WHAT WE DO WHAT WE DON’T DO Four-year vesting requirement for stock options; three-year performance period plus further two-year holding
    period for PSUs No tax gross-up provisions (except as applicable to management employees generally such as relocation policy) Incentive compensation programs feature multiple, different performance measures aligned with the Company’s
    strategic performance metrics No dividend/dividend equivalents paid on unvested equity awards Short-term and long-term performance metrics that balance our absolute performance and our relative performance
    versus peer companies No “single trigger” change of control benefits Rigorous, no-fault clawback policy that is triggered even in the absence of wrongdoing No active defined benefit pension program since 2003 Minimum one-year vesting requirement for 95% of shares granted under the Company’s stock plan No hedging of Danaher securities permitted Stock ownership requirements for all executive officers No long-term incentive compensation is denominated or paid in cash (other than PSU dividend accruals) Limited perquisites and a cap on CEO/CFO personal aircraft usage No above-market returns on deferred compensation plans Independent compensation consultant that performs no other services for the Company No overlapping performance metrics between short-term and long-term incentive compensation programs We are asking our shareholders to indicate their support for
our named executive officer compensation as described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, we are asking our shareholders to
vote on an advisory basis “FOR” the following non-binding resolution: “RESOLVED, that the compensation paid
to the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is
hereby approved.” Although this advisory vote is non-binding, our Board and Compensation Committee will review the voting
results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding our named executive officer compensation programs. THE
    BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE
    RESOLUTION SET FORTH IN PROPOSAL 3. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 80 Back to Contents PROPOSAL 4 Advisory Vote
on Frequency of Future Advisory Votes Relating to the Company’s Named Executive Officer Compensation In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking
our shareholders to vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting to indicate on an advisory basis how frequently we should seek an advisory
vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. By voting on this Proposal 4, shareholders may indicate whether they
would prefer an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation every one, every two, or every three years. Danaher has been holding an annual say-on-pay vote since 2011, and
after careful consideration of this proposal, our Board has determined that an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation
that occurs every year continues to be the most appropriate alternative for Danaher at this time, and therefore our Board recommends
that you vote for a one-year interval for the advisory vote on named executive officer compensation. In formulating its recommendation,
our Board considered that an annual advisory vote on named executive officer compensation allows our shareholders to provide us
with their direct input on our executive compensation program as disclosed in the proxy statement every year. You may cast your vote on your preferred voting frequency by choosing
the option of one year, two years, three years or abstain from voting when you vote, on an advisory basis, in response to the following
non-binding resolution. “RESOLVED, that the option of every one year, every two years,
or every three years that receives the highest number of votes cast for this resolution will be considered to be the preferred
frequency of the shareholders with which the Company is to hold future shareholder advisory votes on named executive officer compensation.” The option of every one year, every two years or every three years that receives the highest number of votes cast by shareholders
will be the frequency for the advisory vote on named executive officer compensation that has been recommended by shareholders.
However, because this vote is advisory and not binding on the Board, the Board may decide that it is in the best interests of our
shareholders and Danaher to hold an advisory vote on named executive compensation more or less frequently than the option approved
by our shareholders. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS     VOTE FOR ADVISORY
    VOTES RELATING TO THE COMPANY’S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION TO BE HELD
    EVERY ONE     YEAR. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 81 Back to Contents PROPOSAL 5 Shareholder Proposal Requesting Adoption of a Policy
Separating the Chair and CEO Roles and Requiring an Independent Board Chair Whenever Possible The Company has been informed that John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue,
No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA, 902778, a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock having a minimum value as set forth in Rule
14a-8 of the Exchange Act allowing submission of proposals by stockholders meeting certain requirements, intends to present the
proposal set forth below at the Annual Meeting. The Company is not responsible for any inaccuracies it may contain. Proposal 5 – Independent Board Chairman Shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt an enduring
policy, and amend the governing documents as necessary in order that 2 separate people hold the office the Chairman and the office
of the CEO. Whenever possible, the Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent
Director. The Board has the discretion to select a Temporary Chairman of the
Board who is not an Independent Director to serve while the Board is seeking an Independent Chairman of the Board on an accelerated
basis. It is a best practice to adopt this policy soon. However this policy
could be phased in when there is a contract renewal for our current CEO or for the next CEO transition. This proposal topic won 52% support at Boeing and 54% support at Baxter
International in 2020. Boeing then adopted this proposal topic. The roles of Chairman and CEO are fundamentally different and should
be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent of the CEO and our company. A lead director is no substitute for an independent Board Chairman.
The Danaher Lead Director, Ms. Linda Filler violates the most important attribute of a Lead Director – independence. As director
tenure goes up director independence goes down. Ms. Filler has 18-years director tenure at Danaher. It is amazing the number of
companies that claim that a Lead Director is some sort of substitute for an independent Board Chairman and then select a director
with the longest tenure as Lead Director. Ms. Filler received 107 million against votes in 2022. One of the primary functions of an independent Chairman of the Board
is the manage the Board of Director which is lacking at Danaher. For example 5 Danaher directors each received between 100 million
and 200 million against votes each in 2022: Linda Filler, lead director. Teri List Walter Lohr, age 79, overdue for retirement with 40-years DHR director
tenure. Shane Sanders, sad since Mr. Sanders is a relatively new director. John Schwieters, age 83, overdue for retirement with 20-years DHR
director tenure. According to the 2022 annual meeting proxy the Danaher so-called Lead
Director has only 4 duties: Presides over certain meetings if they occur in a given year. Can call a meeting of certain directors but cannot call a meeting
of the entire Board. Can act as a liaison but only as necessary. Can edit the Board’s agenda. The ascending complexities of a company with $175 Billion in market
capitalization, like Danaher, increasingly demand that 2 persons fill the 2 most important jobs at Danaher on an enduring basis
– Chairman and CEO Please vote yes: Independent Board Chairman – Proposal
5 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 82 Back to Contents Company’s Statement in Opposition The proponent’s proposal is clearly not based on a careful analysis
or understanding of Danaher’s leadership structure, given that the proposal suggests a need to separate Danaher’s CEO
and Chair positions despite the fact that these positions have been separated for more than thirty years. It is not surprising
therefore that the balance of the proposal, suggesting the need for an independent chair, similarly reflects little understanding
of the significant benefits of the Company’s current leadership structure and the extremely strong shareholder returns Danaher
has generated since such structure has been in place. The Board recommends that you vote against this shareholder proposal
because our current leadership structure (with Steven Rales as executive Chairman and Ms. Filler as Lead Independent Director (“LID”)),
already achieves the independent leadership and effective management oversight sought by the proponent and has served the Company
and its shareholders exceptionally well: • During Mr. Rales’ tenure as Danaher’s Chairman of the Board (which began in 1984), Danaher has realized a compounded, average annual shareholder return of 21.7% (compared to 10.8% for the S&P 500 Index over the same time period) and a total shareholder return of over 173,954% (compared to approximately 5,345% for the S&P 500 Index over the same period). • Danaher has outperformed the compounded, average annual shareholder return of the S&P 500 Index over each of the last two, three-, five-, ten-, fifteen-, twenty- and twenty-five year periods, with a return of 9.7% over the last two years, 20.5% over the last three years, 23.9% over the last five years, 20.7% over the last ten years, 15.3% over the last fifteen years, 16.9% over the last twenty years and 16.7% over the last twenty-five years. Our Board believes that as a result of his substantial ownership stake
in the Company, Mr. Rales is uniquely able to understand, articulate and advocate for the rights and interests of the Company’s
shareholders. Moreover, Mr. Rales uses his management experience with the Company and his Board tenure to help ensure that the
non-management directors have a keen understanding of the Company’s business as well as the strategic and other risks and
opportunities that the Company faces. This enables the Board to more effectively provide insight and direction to, and exercise
oversight of, the Company’s President and CEO and the rest of the management team responsible for the Company’s day-to-day
business. Our Board has further bolstered its leadership structure by appointing
an independent and active LID. As LID, Ms. Filler presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman of the Board and
the Chairman of the Executive Committee are not present, including the executive sessions of non-management directors, which are
typically held at the end of each regularly scheduled Board meeting; has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors;
serves as a liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors, engaging frequently with Mr. Steven Rales on a range of
topics relating to the Board and the Company’s governance program; approves information sent to the Board; approves meeting agendas
for the Board; approves meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; and engages
with major shareholders, including direct communication, as appropriate. Ms. Filler’s role as Chair of the Board’s
Nominating and Governance Committee complements her LID role and further strengthens her Board leadership, as she leverages her
deep insights regarding the Board’s composition, performance and governance. We also believe that an assessment of the appropriateness of a company’s
board leadership structure should be made on a holistic basis, taking into consideration the company’s overall governance
structure. We embrace numerous corporate governance best practices designed to ensure independent leadership and full accountability
to our shareholders, as further detailed on page 22. While the leadership structure that the proponent reflexively proposes
may be appropriate for the other companies cited in the proposal, we believe that the proposed structure would significantly diminish
the accountability and stewardship that our shareholders currently enjoy as a result of Mr. Rales’ and Ms. Filler’s
leadership. Our Board has no established policy on whether or not to separate the Chair and CEO roles and have a non-executive
chairman and firmly believes it is important to retain the flexibility to adopt the leadership structure most effective under the
applicable facts and circumstances. THE
    BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE AGAINST PROPOSAL 5 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 83 Back to Contents PROPOSAL 6 Shareholder Proposal Requesting Report to Shareholders
on Effectiveness of the Company’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Efforts The Company has been informed that As You Sow, on behalf of Eliana
Fishman, 1833 9 th Street NW, Washington, DC 20001, a beneficial owner of 36 shares of Danaher common stock, and Minnesota
Valley Trust, 1960 Cedar Lake Parkway, Minneapolis, MN 55416, a beneficial owner of 129 shares of Danaher common stock, intends
to present the proposal set forth below at the Annual Meeting. The Company is not responsible for any inaccuracies it may contain. RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Danaher Corp. (“Danaher”)
report to shareholders on the effectiveness of the Company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The report should be done
at reasonable expense, exclude proprietary information, and provide transparency on outcomes, using quantitative metrics for hiring,
retention, and promotion of employees, including data by gender, race, and ethnicity. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Quantitative data is sought so investors
can assess and compare the effectiveness of companies’ diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. WHEREAS: Danaher has not shared sufficient quantitative hiring,
retention, and promotion data to allow investors to determine the effectiveness of its human capital management programs. Best
practice disclosure includes hiring, retention, and promotion rate data by gender, race, and ethnicity in line with Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defined categories. Between September 2020 and September 2022, S&P 100 companies increased
by 298 percent their release of hiring rate data by gender, race, and ethnicity; retention rate data by 481 percent; and promotion
rate data by 300 percent. 1 Companies that release, or have committed to release, more inclusion
data than Danaher include Ecolab, Gilead Sciences, and Illumina. Danaher is increasingly a laggard in its decision to continue
to withhold these data sets. Numerous studies have pointed to the benefits of a diverse workforce: • There is a positive association between diversity in management and cash flow, net profit, revenue, and return on equity. 2 • Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 21 percent more likely to outperform on profitability. 3 • The 20 most diverse companies had an average annual five-year stock return that was 5.8 percentage points higher than
    the 20 least diverse companies. 4 Similar to how an income statement pairs with a balance sheet, hiring,
promotion, and retention rate data show how well a company manages its workforce diversity. Without this data, investors are unable
to assess the effectiveness of a company’s human capital management program. Companies should look to hire the best talent. However, Black, and
Latino applicants face hiring challenges. Results of a meta-analysis of 24 field experiments found that, with identical resumes,
White applicants received an average of 36 percent more callbacks than Black applicants and 24 percent more callbacks than Latino
applicants. 5 Promotion rates show how well diverse talent is nurtured at a company.
Unfortunately, women and employees of color experience “a broken rung” in their careers; for every 100 men who are
promoted, only 86 women are. Women of color are particularly impacted, comprising 17 percent of the entry-level workforce and only
four percent of executives. 6 Retention rates show whether employees choose to remain at a company.
Morgan Stanley has found that employee retention above industry average can indicate a competitive advantage and higher levels
of future profitability. 7 Companies with high employee satisfaction have also been linked to annualized outperformance
of over two percent. 8 1 https://www.asyousow.org/our-work/social-justice/workplace-equity 2 https://www.asyousow.org/report-pages/workplace-diversity-and-financial-performance 3 https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/delivering-through-

    with active support from the Board and executive management; has set ambitious DEI improvement goals and made meaningful progress
    toward achieving those goals; and has been highly transparent in quantifying the performance of its DEI program. We encourage
    you to review the “Diversity + Inclusion” section of our most recent sustainability report available in the “Sustainability”
    section of Danaher’s website at http://www.danaher.com. • Given that Danaher’s extensive disclosures already give investors the data they need to assess the effectiveness
    of our DEI program, the proponents’ request for a special report – as well as their request for additional, highly
    granular demographic data that few companies publish -- would be an unnecessary and inefficient use of resources that would
    serve only the limited interests of a small group of shareholders. • The proponents’ statement is misleading in a number of respects. They do not disclose the number of companies that
    actually disclose the granular data they are seeking (despite referring to such data disclosure as “best
    practice”).     They cite year-over-year percentage increases in disclosures of certain categories of data among the
    S&P 100, yet the     data categories for which they provide these percentages are much more general than the extremely
    granular disclosures they     are seeking from Danaher. Perhaps most misleadingly, the proponents claim Danaher is a
    disclosure “laggard”     even though as of March 6, 2023, As You Sow’s own Russell 1000 Workplace
    Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Disclosure     Scorecard ranked Danaher in the top 8% of the Russell 1000 (and top
    6% of the Health Care sector). • Leadership support. Danaher’s annual sustainability report demonstrates a strategic commitment to DEI
    at the highest levels of our organization. Among other initiatives, we require every people leader (including our executive
    officers) to have a DEI-related personal performance or development objective as part of our annual performance review process, and
    for the third straight year in 2023 we have deployed one of our most powerful DBS tools, Policy Deployment (“PD”), to
    drive continued progress toward our DEI goals. PD’s rigorous “plan-do-check-adjust” approach has driven
    significant progress toward achievement of our DEI goals, as evidenced by the results noted below. • Goals and progress . We have set ambitious, public goals to improve our gender and People of Color (“POC”) diversity and have demonstrated meaningful progress toward achieving these goals: • 2025 goal: 40% female representation in global workforce . As of December 31, 2022, 38% of Danaher’s employees
    were women. • 2025 goal: 38% POC representation in U.S. workforce . As of December 31, 2022, 41% of Danaher’s U.S. employees
    were POCs. • Transparency and quantitative data. We have been highly transparent in quantifying the performance
    of our DEI program. We publicly disclose in our annual sustainability report: • Employee demographic data by gender, race and age – For each of gender and race, we disclose data on an overall basis and in sub-categories based on job
    level (and in the case of gender, by geography) ■ For the U.S., we provide even further granularity by disclosing job level detail for each EEOC race/ethnicity
    category. We also disclose our most recent U.S. Federal Employer Information Report (Form EEO-1) Employment Data. • New hire data by gender and (for the U.S.) People of Color • U.S. pay equity by gender and race – Since 2020, we have achieved and maintained pay equity (with respect to salary and short-term incentive
    compensation) for women and for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. based on an analysis of weighted median base pay. • Voluntary and involuntary turnover • Internal fill rate • Full-time, part-time and temporary employees • Conclusion. We are devoting significant time and resources to advancing our DEI strategy and achieving
    our strategic DEI objectives. Diverting those resources to address the proponents’ interest in a specialized report
    and a set of additional, intricate data that few companies, and none of Danaher’s peer companies, provide would be inefficient
    and costly without adding significant value to our shareholders. In addition, As You Sow’s own top-decile ranking of
    Danaher’s DEI disclosure practices suggest that Danaher’s disclosures already reflect the best practices espoused
    by the proponents. THE

to one vote on each directorship and other matter brought before the Annual Meeting. Your shares will be voted in accordance with
your instructions. The Board has selected Steven M. Rales, Mitchell P. Rales, Brian W. Ellis and James F. O’Reilly, or any
of them, to act as proxies with full power of substitution. All votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for
the meeting. In addition, if you have returned a signed proxy card or submitted
voting instructions by telephone or online, the proxy holders will have, and intend to exercise, discretion to vote your shares
(other than shares held in the Savings Plans) in accordance with their best judgment on any matters not identified in this Proxy
Statement that are properly brought to a vote at the Annual Meeting. At present we do not know of any such additional matters. If your shares are registered in your name and you sign and return
a proxy card or vote by telephone or online but do not give voting instructions on a particular matter, the proxy holders will
be authorized to vote your shares on that matter in accordance with the Board’s recommendation. If you hold your shares through
an account with a bank, broker, trustee or other intermediary and do not give voting instructions on a matter, we expect that under
the rules of the New York Stock Exchange the bank, broker, trustee or other intermediary will be permitted to vote in its discretion
only on Proposal 2 and will not be permitted to vote on any of the other Proposals, resulting in a so-called “broker non-vote.”
The impact of abstentions and broker non-votes on the overall vote is shown in the following table. Broker non-votes will not affect
the attainment of a quorum since the bank, broker, trustee or other intermediary has discretion to vote on Proposal 2 and these
votes will be counted toward establishing a quorum. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 88 Back to Contents Votes Required and Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes Matter Required Vote Impact of Abstentions Impact of Broker

Board. Employees of Danaher may solicit proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors by mail, email, in person and by telephone.
These employees will not receive any additional compensation for these activities. Danaher will bear the cost of soliciting proxies
and will reimburse banks, brokers, trustees and other intermediaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding
proxy materials to shareholders. We have retained Broadridge Financial Services, Inc. to aid in distributing proxy materials and
the solicitation of proxies. For these services, we expect to pay Broadridge a fee of less than $15,000 and reimburse it for certain
out-of-pocket disbursements and expenses. Eliminating Duplicate Mailings Danaher has adopted the “householding” procedure approved
by the SEC, which allows us to deliver one set of documents to a household of shareholders instead of delivering a set to each
shareholder in a household, unless we have been instructed otherwise. This procedure is more environmentally friendly and cost-effective
because it reduces the number of copies to be printed and mailed. Shareholders who receive proxy materials in paper form will continue
to receive separate proxy cards/voting instruction forms to vote their shares. Shareholders who receive the Notice of Internet
Availability will receive instructions on submitting their proxy cards/voting instruction form via the Internet. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 89 Back to Contents If you would like to change your householding election, request that
a single copy of the proxy materials be sent to your address, or request a separate copy of the proxy materials, please contact
our transfer agent at 800-568-3476. We will promptly deliver the proxy materials to you upon receipt of your request. If you own
your shares in “street name,” please contact your broker, bank, trustee or other intermediary to make your request. If you receive more than one proxy card/voting instruction form, your
shares probably are registered in more than one account or you may hold shares both as a registered shareholder and through one
of the Savings Plans. You should vote each proxy card/voting instruction form you receive. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 90 Back to Contents OTHER INFORMATION Information Relating to Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements included in this Proxy Statement are “forward-looking
