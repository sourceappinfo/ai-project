the Annual Meeting, on Tuesday, March 20, 2012 at the offices of Latham & Watkins, LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, New York. The meeting will start at 9:00 a.m. (EDT). Our stockholders of record on Wednesday, January 25, 2012 will receive either (1) a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials, or Notice, containing instructions on how to access an electronic copy of our proxy materials and vote their shares, or (2) a copy of this Proxy Statement, the proxy card, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Notice will also
contain instructions on how to request a paper copy of our proxy materials to be sent to you. These materials are presented on our behalf by order of the Board of Directors, or the Board. You may also find useful information about the Company on our website at www.coopercos.com in the Investor Relations section. Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy
materials? The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, has adopted regulations that permit us to provide our
materials electronically to stockholders. Accordingly, on or about February 10, 2012 we mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of the Proxy Materials, or the Notice. The Notice was sent to our stockholders of record on January 25, 2012,
which was our Record Date. All stockholders receiving the Notice have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or to request a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. In addition,
stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in the printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. We encourage stockholders to take advantage of the availability of proxy materials on the internet to help reduce the
environmental impact of our Annual Meeting. Can I vote my shares by filling out and returning the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials? No. The Notice only identifies the items to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. You cannot vote by marking the
Notice and returning it. The Notice provides instructions on how to cast your vote. What proposals will be considered at the Annual
Meeting? At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will be asked to consider and act upon the following proposals: 1. The election of eight directors named in this Proxy Statement to our Board of Directors; 2. The ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2012; 3. An advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement; 4. The transaction of any other business that is properly presented at the meeting. 1 Table of Contents We are not aware of any other business to be brought before the meeting. If any additional
business is properly brought before the meeting, the designated officers serving as proxies will vote in accordance with their best judgment. The Board recommends a vote “FOR” each of the nominees for director, “FOR” the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm and “FOR”
approval of the compensation of our named executive officers. Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? We have set January 25, 2012 as the Record Date for this year’s Annual Meeting. All stockholders who owned our stock at the
close of business on the Record Date are entitled to this notice and to vote at the Annual Meeting and any continuations, adjournments or postponements thereof. As of the Record Date, there were 47,683,106 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. We strongly encourage you to vote. Your vote is important to us. Regardless of whether you plan to attend the meeting, we encourage you to read this Proxy Statement and the accompanying materials,
and to vote your shares as soon as possible to ensure that your vote is recorded. We look forward to your participation. How many votes do
I have? Each outstanding share of our common stock is entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting. You have one vote per
share that you owned at the close of business on the Record Date. How do I vote my shares? As a stockholder, you can vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting or vote by proxy. If you wish to vote by proxy, you can
complete the proxy card and return it by mail. Alternatively, many of our stockholders have the option to vote their shares by telephone or via the internet. If phone or internet voting is available to you, instructions will be included on your
proxy card. What happens if I vote my shares by proxy? When you return a completed proxy card, or vote your shares by telephone or internet, you authorize our officers listed on the proxy card to vote your shares on your behalf as you direct. If you sign and return a proxy card, but do not provide instructions on how to vote your shares, the designated officers will vote on
each of the presented proposals on your behalf as follows: • Shares will be voted FOR each of the individuals nominated to serve as directors; • Shares will be voted FOR ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year
ending October 31, 2012; and • Shares will be voted FOR the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement. Can I change or revoke my vote after I return my proxy card or voting instructions? If you choose to vote your shares by proxy, you may revoke or change your proxy instructions at any time prior to the casting of votes at
the Annual Meeting by taking any of the following actions: 1) Execute and submit a new proxy card; 2 Table of Contents 2) Submit new voting instructions through telephonic or internet voting, if available to you; 3) Notify Carol R. Kaufman, Secretary of the Company, in writing that you wish to revoke your proxy; or 4) Vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting. Attending the Annual Meeting in person will not automatically revoke your proxy. Who pays for
the proxy solicitation and how will the Company solicit votes? We pay all costs associated with the solicitation of
proxies. We will also pay any costs incurred by brokers and other fiduciaries to forward proxy solicitation materials to beneficial owners. We may solicit proxies on behalf of the Board in person or by mail, telephone, facsimile, or e-mail. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by any of our directors, officers or employees. Additionally, we
have retained the firm of D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist with the solicitation of proxies and will pay a fee of $15,500 for this service, plus reasonable costs and expenses. How many votes must be present to hold the Annual Meeting? In order to conduct business and have a valid vote at the Annual Meeting a quorum must be present in person or represented by proxies. A quorum is defined as a majority of the shares outstanding on the
Record Date and entitled to vote. In accordance with Delaware law and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, or Bylaws, broker “non-votes” and proxies reflecting abstentions will be considered present and entitled to vote for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present. What are broker “non-votes”? Broker “non-votes” occur when a broker is not permitted to vote on behalf of shares it holds for a beneficial owner and the
beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions. Shares held in a broker’s name may be voted by the broker, but only in accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE. Under those rules, the broker must follow the
instructions of the beneficial owner. If instructions are not provided, NYSE rules determine whether the broker may vote the shares based on its own judgment or is required to withhold its vote, and the determination depends on the proposal being
voted on. How many votes are required to approve the proposals? Proposal Vote Required Broker Discretionary Voting Allowed Proposal 1 — Election of Directors Majority of Shares Entitled to Vote and Present in Person or Represented by Proxy NO Proposal 2 — Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Majority of Shares Entitled to Vote and Present in Person or Represented by Proxy YES Proposal 3 — Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation Majority of Shares Entitled to Vote and Present in Person or Represented by Proxy NO Detailed information regarding each of the proposals to be presented at the 2012 Annual Meeting, and the

and other matters can be found starting at page 5. 3 Table of Contents S TOCKHOLDER N OMINATIONS A ND P ROPOSALS F OR T HE 2013 A NNUAL M EETING Stockholder Proposals for Inclusion in the 2013 Proxy Statement Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, allows stockholders to submit proposals to be included in our Proxy Statement. Proposals under Rule 14a-8 must be
submitted no later than October 8, 2012 to be included in our next Proxy Statement and considered at the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Proposals should be sent to Carol R. Kaufman, Secretary, The Cooper Companies, Inc., 6140 Stoneridge
Mall Road, Suite 590, Pleasanton, CA 94588. Other Proposals and Stockholder Nominations for Director Our Bylaws allow stockholders to nominate directors for election and to propose other business to be considered by stockholders at the
Annual Meeting. Under the Bylaw provisions, stockholders wishing to submit proposals must notify the Company Secretary in writing. Notice must be sent no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the anniversary date of the prior
year’s annual meeting and no later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the anniversary date of the prior year’s annual meeting. To be considered at the 2013 Annual Meeting, director nominations and other proposals for consideration under these provisions must be submitted no earlier than November 20, 2012 and no later than
December 20, 2012. In the event that we set the date for the 2013 Annual Meeting more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after March 20, 2013, director nominations and other proposals must be submitted no earlier than the close
of business on the 120th day prior to the announced meeting date and no later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the announced meeting date or the 10th day following our first public disclosure of the date of the
meeting. Also, if we increase the number of directors to be elected at the 2013 Annual Meeting, and we do not make a public
announcement at least 100 days prior to March 20, 2013 stating the size of the increase and naming all the nominees for director, then stockholder nominations for directors will be considered if the proposal is delivered to our Secretary at our
principal offices no later than 10 days after we make a public announcement of the increased board size. This only applies to nominations for positions created by the increase and does not apply to nominations for current positions. This also does
not apply to proposals other than the nomination of director candidates. Nominations or proposals should be submitted, in writing, to Carol R. Kaufman, Secretary, The Cooper Companies, Inc., 6140 Stoneridge Mall Road, Suite 590, Pleasanton, CA
94588. A stockholder’s notice to nominate a director or bring any other business before the 2013 Annual Meeting must set forth certain information specified in our Bylaws. Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board will also directly consider suggestions from stockholders for potential
Board nominees for election as directors to be presented at the 2013 Annual Meeting. The person recommending the nominee must be a stockholder entitled to vote at the 2013 Annual Meeting, and the recommendation must be received in writing between
November 20, 2012 and December 20, 2012. To be considered, recommendations should include: (i) the nominee’s written consent to being named in the Proxy Statement as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected, (ii) the
name and address of the stockholder submitting the recommendation or beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposed candidate is being suggested for nomination, and (iii) the class and number of our shares owned beneficially and of record by the

class of our equity securities to file reports with the SEC detailing their ownership and any changes in ownership. SEC regulations also require these persons to provide us with a copy of all reports filed. Based solely on our review of the copies of reports and related amendments we have received, we believe that during and with respect to
the 2011 fiscal year, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater-than-ten-percent owners were met. 7 Table of Contents C ORPORATE G OVERNANCE The Board of Directors The Board is elected annually and each of our directors stands for election every year. Presently the Board is comprised of eight directors, and all except Mr. Weiss have been determined by the Board
to be independent. Mr. Weiss serves as our Chief Executive Officer and is compensated for his position as an executive. He receives no additional compensation for his service on the Board. In making this determination, the Board has affirmed that each of the independent directors meets the objective requirements for
independence set forth by the NYSE and the SEC and that each has no relationship, direct or indirect, to the Company other than as a stockholder or through his or her service on the Board. The Board and its active committees conduct regular
self-evaluations and review director independence and committee composition to ensure continued compliance with regulations. Directors who are not also employees, or Non-Employee Directors, are compensated for their services as described in “ Director
Compensation” on page 43. Under our Corporate Governance Principles, directors are not permitted to serve on
the boards of more than two other public companies while they serve on our Board. We do not limit service on private company boards of directors or with non-profit organizations. Any interested party wishing to communicate with the Board, the Non-Employee Directors, or a specific Board member, may do so by writing
to the Board, the Non-Employee Directors, or the particular Board member, and delivering the communication in person or mailing it to: Board of Directors, c/o Carol R. Kaufman, Secretary, The Cooper Companies, Inc., 6140 Stoneridge Mall Road, Suite
590, Pleasanton, CA 94588. Communications will be distributed to specific Board members as directed by the stockholder in the communication. If addressed generally to the Board, communications may be distributed to specific members of the Board as
appropriate, depending on the material outlined in the stockholder communication. For example, if a communication relates to accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters the communication will be forwarded to the Chairman of the
Audit Committee unless otherwise specified. From time to time, the Board may change the process for interested parties to communicate with the Board or its members. Please refer to our website at http://www.coopercos.com for any changes in
this process. Board Leadership Structure At present, the Chairman position for the Board of Directors is separate from the Chief Executive Officer position. We also maintain a
Lead Director position, which is currently held by Dr. Allan Rubenstein. We have maintained separate positions for the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2007. We feel this division provides a balance between independence of our directors and the experience of our officers. Our current Chairman has significant business experience with the Company, but has
also been affirmatively determined to be independent by our Board. We feel that this combination provides strong, knowledgeable leadership of the Board, independent of the CEO position’s immediate day-to-day involvement with the Company. Board of Directors’ Role in Risk Oversight Our Board of Directors recognizes the importance of appropriate oversight of potential business risks in running a successful operation and meeting its fiduciary obligations to our business and our
stockholders. While management has responsibility for the day-to-day assessment and management of 8 Table of Contents potential business risks, the Board maintains responsibility for creating an appropriate culture of risk management and setting the proper “tone at the top.” In this role, the Board,
directly and through its committees, takes an active role in overseeing our aggregate risk potential and in assisting management with addressing specific risks, including competitive, legal, regulatory, operational and financial risks. Each
committee of the Board regularly reviews risks related to its area of focus as follows: • The Audit Committee reviews potential risks within our financial operations and internal controls. • The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews potential risks in relation to general governance matters. • The Compensation Committee reviews how our compensation practices and succession planning influences risk taking and risk management. • The Science and Technology Committee reviews potential risks in connection with current technology and potential technology investments. Each committee reports regularly to the Board on these topics and contributes to overall Board review of
potential business risks. Management also frequently addresses risks and risk management in regular reports to the Board and its committees. The Board believes that the current leadership structure facilitates risk oversight by combining experienced leadership with independent direction from the Board and committees, including majority
independent Board membership. Both our Chairman and our CEO have an in-depth understanding of our business, history and specific challenges we face as a business. Our CEO’s experience allows him to promptly identify and raise key business risks
to the Board, and our Chairman’s history with the Company provides the Board with an independent voice who can also provide insight into management decisions and market dynamics based on our specific business operations. The Board believes that
the balance between our Chairman, CEO, and the independent committees of the Board enhances our risk oversight process and encourages appropriate levels of risk within our enterprise. Additionally, in the 2011 fiscal year, the Board also appointed a Chief Risk Officer who maintains responsibility for direct risk
oversight and review of our identified business risks, including potential risks. The Board feels that the appointment of an executive officer directly responsible for monitoring risks provides an active position dedicated to the identification and
monitoring of potential business risks and enhances the “tone at the top” message of the importance of risk oversight. Board Committees The Board maintains four standing committees whose functions are described below. As required by
the SEC and NYSE, all members of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Organization and Compensation Committee are independent directors. At the Board’s discretion, other committees may include
directors who have not been determined to be independent. Currently the Board maintains one committee, the Science and Technology Committee, which has non-independent director membership. Committee membership is determined by the Board. Each committee maintains a written charter detailing its authority and responsibilities. These charters are reviewed and updated
periodically as legislative and regulatory developments and business circumstances warrant. The committee charters are available in their entirety on our website at http://www.coopercos.com. The Audit Committee provides advice with respect to our financial matters and assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight
responsibilities regarding: (i) the quality and integrity of our financial 9 Table of Contents statements, (ii) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (iii) review of our potential risk factors, (iv) the qualifications and independence of the independent
accounting firm serving as auditors of the Company, and (v) the oversight and performance of the Company’s internal audit function and the outside auditors. The Audit Committee advises and makes recommendations to the Board regarding our
financial, investment and accounting procedures and practices. The members of the Audit Committee are Steven Rosenberg
(Chair), Michael H. Kalkstein and Jody S. Lindell. The
Organization and Compensation Committee , or the Compensation Committee, reviews and approves all aspects of the compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer and all executives identified by the Compensation Committee as officers under
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee also approves all compensation for employees whose total combined annual base salary plus target non-equity incentive bonus is $400,000 or greater, regardless of whether they have
been designated as officers under Section 16(a). Members of the Compensation Committee are not eligible to participate in any of our executive compensation programs. The Compensation Committee approves base salary levels and overall compensation packages for the executive officers. The Compensation Committee also approves all awards under our equity and non-equity
incentive bonus plans and has approval authority for all agreements providing for the payment of benefits following a change in control of the company, severance following a termination of employment or any other special arrangement with the
executive officers or employees which would affect their compensation. The members of the Compensation Committee are Michael
H. Kalkstein (Chair), Jody S. Lindell, Donald Press and Allan E. Rubenstein, M.D. The
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee develops, implements, and maintains the corporate governance standards by which we conduct business, and advises and makes recommendations to the Board concerning our primary governance policies. The
Committee meets with the Chief Executive Officer and senior corporate staff as it deems appropriate to fulfill its obligations with regard to our corporate governance standards. The Committee also identifies and selects qualified candidates for nomination to the Board. The Committee believes that nominees for
election to the Board must possess certain minimum qualifications and attributes. To be nominated by the Board, an individual: (i) must meet the objective independence requirements set forth by the SEC and NYSE (other than executive nominees),
(ii) must exhibit strong personal integrity, character, and ethics, and a commitment to ethical business and accounting practices, (iii) must not serve on more than two other public company boards, (iv) must not be involved in
on-going litigation with us or be employed by an entity which is engaged in such litigation, and (v) must not be the subject of any on-going criminal investigations, including investigations for fraud or financial misconduct. The Committee does
not currently maintain a separate diversity policy. Instead the Committee relies on diversity as one of many factors in the consideration of director nominees who meet these stated criteria. The Committee will consider suggestions from stockholders
for nominees for election as directors at our Annual Stockholder Meetings on the same terms as nominees selected by the Committee. Stockholder suggestions must be received on a timely basis and meet the criteria set forth in the information on Other Proposals and Stockholder Nominations for Director on page 4. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, no stockholder suggestions for director nominees have been received by the Committee. Except as set forth above, the Committee does
not currently have a formal process for identifying and evaluating nominees for directors, including nominees recommended by stockholders. 10 Table of Contents The members of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee are Donald Press
(Chair), A. Thomas Bender, Steven Rosenberg, Allan E. Rubenstein, M.D. and Stanley Zinberg, M.D. The Science
and Technology Committee evaluates new and existing technologies. The Committee’s primary functions are to: (i) discuss technology that falls outside the usual scope of current business, (ii) periodically review our research and
development projects and portfolio, (iii) annually review our key technologies and assess the position of these technologies versus third party products and process, and (iv) provide information and guidance to the Board on matters
relating to science and technology. The Science and Technology Committee functions on an ad hoc basis. The members of the
Science and Technology Committee are Stanley Zinberg, M.D. (Chair), Allan E. Rubenstein, M.D., Robert S. Weiss and A. Thomas Bender. Meetings The
Board and committees met as follows during our fiscal year ended October 31, 2011: Number of Meetings Board of Directors 11 Audit Committee 11 Organization and Compensation Committee 8 Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee 5 Science and Technology Committee 5 The Non-Employee Directors also meet routinely in executive session in connection with regular meetings
of the Board and more often as they deem appropriate. Either Mr. Bender, as Chair, or Dr. Rubenstein, as Lead Director, presides over executive sessions. Currently we do not maintain a formal policy regarding director attendance at the Annual Meeting; however, it is expected that absent compelling circumstances directors will attend. Last year all of the
directors attended. During the 2011 fiscal year, each director attended at least 95% of the aggregate of board meetings and
meetings of committees on which the director served. Corporate Governance Policies We have an ongoing commitment to good governance and business practices. In furtherance of this commitment, we regularly monitor
developments in the area of corporate governance, and review company processes and procedures in light of such developments. We comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE and implement other corporate governance
practices we believe are in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. We believe that the policies currently in place enhance our stockholders’ interests. In keeping with this commitment, we have recently amended our corporate bylaws to adopt a majority voting standard for the election of our directors. Corporate Governance Principles The Board has approved a set of Corporate Governance Principles, or the Principles, for the Company. The Principles are available in their entirety on our website at http://www.coopercos.com . 11 Table of Contents The Principles set out our standards for director qualifications, director responsibilities, Board committees, director access to officers and employees, director compensation, director
orientation, and continuing education and performance evaluations of the Chief Executive Officer and of the Board and its committees. Under the Principles, the Non-Employee Directors are required to maintain a minimum level of ownership in our common stock. The Board has adopted ownership requirements for Non-Employee Directors
requiring directors to hold Cooper common stock valued at three times their annual retainer for service as a director. Shares held must be free of restrictions to meet the requirements. Until the required ownership values are met, the Non-Employee
Directors must retain 100% of shares received on vesting of restricted stock and on exercise of stock options. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, all of the Non-Employee Directors hold stock equal to, or in excess of, the minimum level of
required ownership. Ethics and Business Conduct Policy We have adopted an Ethics and Business Conduct Policy, or Ethics Policy, that is available in its entirety on our website at http://www.coopercos.com . All our employees, officers, and directors,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, are required to adhere to the Ethics Policy in discharging their work-related responsibilities. Employees are encouraged to report any conduct that they believe in good faith to be
an actual or apparent violation of the Ethics Policy. Amendments to the Ethics Policy and any waivers from the Ethics Policy
granted to directors or executive officers will be made available through our website. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we have amended the Ethics Policy once since adoption and no waivers have been requested or granted. Procedures for Handling Accounting Complaints The Audit Committee has established procedures for receipt and handling of potential complaints we may receive regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for the
confidential, anonymous submission by our employees of concerns regarding accounting or auditing matters. In furtherance of this goal, we have established a confidential hotline managed by an independent third-party vendor through which employees
may report concerns about our business practices. Related Party Transactions We review all relationships and transactions in which the Company and our directors and executive officers or their immediate family
members are participants. Our legal staff is primarily responsible for monitoring and obtaining information from the directors and executive officers with respect to related person transactions and for then determining, based on the facts and
circumstances, whether the company or a related person has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction. As required under SEC rules, transactions that are determined to be directly or indirectly material to the company or a related
person are disclosed in our Proxy Statement. We have determined that there were no material related party transactions during
the 2011 fiscal year. 12 Table of Contents R EPORT O F T HE A UDIT C OMMITTEE The Audit Committee is comprised of three independent directors —
Steven Rosenberg (Chair), Michael H. Kalkstein and Jody S. Lindell. The Board has determined that all members of the Audit Committee are financially literate as required by the NYSE and has also determined that both Mr. Rosenberg and
Ms. Lindell meet the qualifications of an audit committee financial expert as defined by the SEC. The Audit Committee
operates under a written charter adopted by the Board in December 2004 and most recently amended in October 2011. The Audit Committee’s charter is available in its entirety on our website at http://www.coopercos.com and to any
stockholder otherwise requesting a copy. The Audit Committee provides advice with respect to our financial matters and
assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding: (i) the quality and integrity of our financial statements, (ii) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (iii) review of our potential risk
factors, (iv) the qualifications, independence and performance of KPMG LLP, or KPMG, in its role as our independent registered public accounting firm, (v) retention and engagement of KPMG LLP and oversight of their work, and
(vi) overseeing the performance of our internal audit function and reviewing our internal controls. The Audit Committee’s primary duties and responsibilities relate to: a. Management’s maintenance of the reliability and integrity of our accounting policies and financial reporting and financial disclosure practices; b. Management’s establishment and maintenance of processes to assure that an adequate system of internal controls is functioning effectively within the company; and c. Engagement, retention and termination of KPMG LLP. Management is responsible for the Company’s internal controls and the financial reporting process. The Committee has engaged Ernst & Young LLP, or Ernst & Young, to assist in the
assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. KPMG, as the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and to
issue a report on the audit process. The Audit Committee’s responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. In this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and KPMG regarding the fair and complete
presentation of the Company’s results. The Audit Committee held 11 meetings during the 2011 fiscal year, including
regular meetings in conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter, during which the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Company’s financial statements with management and KPMG. These Audit Committee meetings routinely include
executive sessions of the committee, as well as private sessions with each of KPMG, Ernst & Young, and management. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2011 with the Company’s management and KPMG, and management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 “ Communication with Audit Committees” , as amended by SAS No. 91. The Audit Committee also reviewed and discussed with KPMG, management, and Ernst & Young the processes and procedures associated
with our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, including management’s assessment of such controls. 13 Table of Contents The Audit Committee maintains policies and procedures for the pre-approval of work performed
by KPMG. Under its charter, the Audit Committee must approve all engagements in advance. All engagements with estimated fees above $150,000 require consideration and approval by the full Audit Committee. The Chair of the Audit Committee has the
authority to approve on behalf of the full Audit Committee all engagements with fees estimated to be below $150,000. Management recommendations are considered in connection with such engagements, but management has no authority to approve
engagements. In the 2011 fiscal year, the Audit Committee received both the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG that
are mandated by applicable requirements regarding the independent accountant’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee discussed KPMG’s independence from the Company with the lead engagement
partner. KPMG provided no non-audit services during the 2011 fiscal year. The Audit Committee or its Chair approved all audit services provided by KPMG for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2011. The total fees paid or payable to KPMG for the
last two fiscal years are as follows: Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2011 Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2010 Audit Fees $ 4,125,100 $ 3,747,572 Audit Related Fees $ -0- $ -0- Tax Fees $ -0- $ -0- All Other Fees $ -0- $ -0- Based on the Audit Committee’s discussions with management and KPMG, the Audit Committee’s
review of the representations of management, the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board
that our audited consolidated financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2011 for filing with the SEC.

Compensation Committee of the Board has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion
and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2011. ORGANIZATION AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE Michael H. Kalkstein (Chair) Jody S. Lindell Donald Press Allan E. Rubenstein, M.D. 17 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The Organization & Compensation Committee of our Board, referred to here as the Compensation Committee, administers our
executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee endeavors to provide compensation packages for our Named Executive Officers that are competitive within our industry and that provide a substantial emphasis on Company performance and
stockholder returns. Our total executive compensation is designed to have a balanced focus on both short- and long-term goals. Direct compensation consists of a base salary, annual cash incentive bonus, and long-term equity incentive awards. Last year we received a favorable advisory vote on our executive compensation program, with over 95% of our stockholders
voting to approve our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee believes this affirms shareholders’ support of the Company’s approach to executive compensation and did not change its approach in the 2011 fiscal year. The
Compensation Committee will continue to consider the outcome of the Company’s say-on-pay advisory votes when making future compensation decisions for the named executive officers. Executive Summary — The 2011 Fiscal Year in Review In the 2011
fiscal year, we continued a trend of meeting or exceeding our financial goals. Although we faced challenges during the 2011 fiscal year, we continued to deliver record growth and expanded market share. Successes this year included: • A 15% increase in revenues and a 20% increase in operating income over the 2010 fiscal year, as well as achievement of earnings per share and cash flow
at 121% and 177%, respectively, of budgeted targets, maintaining our ongoing trend of exceptional growth; • Significant reductions in our debt and a successful refinancing of our available credit facilities which should reduce our annual interest expense; • The successful completion of two acquisitions for our women’s healthcare business and the integration of the acquisition of the Aime business in
Japan for our contact lens business; • Expansion of manufacturing capacity in our contact lens business, which has allowed key product launches in targeted markets, including Japan; • Geographic expansion of both our contact lens and women’s healthcare businesses, including expanded presence in Europe and Latin America; • Continued gains in market share worldwide for our contact lens products; and • Recognition as one of the best places to work and as one of the best companies for leaders in a global survey. 18 Table of Contents These achievements represent the continuation of a strong growth trend during the past four
fiscal years. We have steadily increased our revenues and free cash flow, as well as provided strong stockholder returns through increases in earnings per share. The Compensation Committee gives consideration to both our prior year performance and projected growth
in setting compensation targets for our coming fiscal year and making determinations regarding increases to base salary, short-term bonus targets, and appropriate equity award levels and performance award targets. In keeping with our policy that
performance should be rewarded, and in accordance with the terms of our incentive plans, our strong performance in the 2011 fiscal year resulted in total compensation above target levels for our Named Executive Officers. Our bonus award calculations
and other executive compensation decisions for the 2011 fiscal year are discussed in more detail below. Compensation Objectives and
Connection to Performance The Compensation Committee emphasizes performance by making the majority of the total
compensation for our Named Executive Officers dependent on financial results and long-term service to the Company. For the 2011 fiscal year, 65-77% of total executive compensation was dependent on performance-based components and long-term equity
awards. The total compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer was 85% dependent on performance-based components and long-term equity awards. 19 Table of Contents The Compensation Committee structures executive compensation packages to make compensation
dependent on achievement of both long-term and short-term objectives and stockholder returns based on the following objectives: • Link total compensation to a combination of individual achievements, Company performance and stockholder returns; • Encourage achievement of both short-term operational goals and long-term strategic objectives; • Structure executive incentive compensation in a way that provides award opportunities based on ambitious Company performance objectives; • Maintain a proper balance between fixed and variable compensation, and long-term and short-term incentives, with recognition of our senior
executives’ responsibility for the Company’s overall performance and market value; and • Provide sufficiently competitive compensation packages to attract, retain, and motivate high caliber executive management. In assessing whether our compensation practices meet these objectives, the Compensation Committee receives
regular updates on our business results from management and reviews our quarterly financial statements and management projections to assess the connection between executive compensation and our business objectives. The Compensation Committee also
regularly reviews information regarding our peer companies, including reported revenues, profit levels, market capitalization, shareholder returns, and disclosed governance practices, to assess our comparative performance and peer compensation
practices. In addition to using peer group analysis, the Compensation Committee also receives and reviews broader, general industry compensation data relative to other companies our size. Using these reports and assessments from management and independent consultants, the Compensation Committee evaluates the components of
compensation for the Named Executive Officers to ensure continued alignment with our business objectives and stockholder returns. Our Incentive Payment Plan, under which short-term bonuses are paid, includes performance metrics that are reviewed and updated annually to provide for both (i) objectively determined awards that
reflect our fiscal year goals and are based on achievement of our financial results, and (ii) subjectively determined awards at the Committee’s discretion as described below. The Compensation Committee works closely with both its
independent compensation consultant and management to structure our Incentive Payment Plan and to determine appropriate award levels and targets. The Compensation Committee also works closely with both its independent compensation consultant and management regarding long-term equity incentives. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the form
and amount of equity awards made to our executives, as well as the current and potential economic value and cost of equity awards to the Company and their dilutive effect. This review supports our goals of maximizing motivation and retention value
for key executives, while emphasizing stockholder returns and our long-term achievement as a company. Chief Executive Officer
Compensation Robert S. Weiss has served as our Chief Executive Officer since November 2007. The Compensation Committee
sets Mr. Weiss’ compensation in recognition of his overall responsibility for our performance and the CEO’s significant role in our strategic direction, management, leadership, and 20 Table of Contents operations. This practice is consistent with our peer group, as described below, and general industry compensation practices as presented in reports from management’s compensation consultant
and the independent compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee. In setting Mr. Weiss’ compensation
levels for the 2011 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee reviewed four factors as follows: (i) his successful performance of business objectives that were approved for him for the prior fiscal year, (ii) Mr. Weiss’ assessment
of his own performance, (iii) the Committee’s own assessment of Mr. Weiss’ performance which it discussed with the Board, and (iv) Mr. Weiss’ compensation relative to our designated peer group. In addition, the
Compensation Committee reviewed recommendations from both its compensation consultant and management’s compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee determined that it would be appropriate to increase Mr. Weiss’ target compensation for the 2011 fiscal year, based on median pay levels for our peer group and our
overall performance in the 2010 fiscal year. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee noted that Mr. Weiss has consistently met or exceeded the objectives set for him during his tenure as CEO. As structured, approximately 85% of
Mr. Weiss’ compensation is performance based. Use of Compensation Consultants, Management Recommendations and Peer Data The Compensation Committee uses management input, independent consultant advice and publicly available peer information as tools to
evaluate the connection between executive compensation and performance. This information is reviewed in a subjective manner and peer information is not linked to our compensation decisions directly or by formula. Independent Compensation Consultant The Compensation Committee has retained J. Richard & Co., or J. Richard, an independent executive compensation consulting firm, to assist with executive compensation analysis. In this capacity,
J. Richard reports directly to the Compensation Committee and does no other work for us. The Compensation Committee has sole authority to determine the terms of J. Richard’s retention and services and J. Richard’s
interactions with management are generally limited to information provided to the Compensation Committee. J. Richard
provides the Compensation Committee with comparative peer group data and information regarding key trends and developments in both cash and equity compensation for comparable publicly traded companies. J. Richard also advises the Compensation
Committee in setting equity award levels and other forms of compensation. The current composition of the peer group and the peer selection process are discussed in more detail below. 21 Table of Contents At the request of the Compensation Committee, J. Richard provides routine compensation
advice, and evaluates compensation recommendations from management and management’s compensation consultant. J. Richard also provides an annual report reviewing Named Executive Officer compensation and providing comparative information
based on the designated peer group. Executive level positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, are compared to similar positions, based on company size and relative authority level, to determine appropriate compensation levels. J. Richard
also performs a regression analysis to normalize the information contained in the report, which allows the Compensation Committee to fairly assess the comparability of the compensation utilized by companies of varying sizes within the peer group.
The Compensation Committee uses the information presented in this report and advice from J. Richard to evaluate our compensation levels against those in the peer group. In making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee also uses
J. Richard as an aid to evaluate and consider management recommendations, including the recommendations of management’s executive compensation consultant. Management Recommendations Management has retained Frederic W.
Cook & Co, Inc., or Frederic Cook, an executive compensation firm, to serve as management’s compensation consultant and to assist with management’s recommendations for our peer group and executive compensation. Management utilizes
Frederic Cook’s analyses to develop compensation recommendations for presentation to the Compensation Committee with regard to salary, annual bonus, long-term equity compensation and total compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as well
as various other elements of our compensation program, such as contractual arrangements and stock ownership guidelines. Mr. Weiss, as Chief Executive Officer, has final authority for the retention of Frederic Cook. Mr. Weiss provides recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding: (i) appropriate peer group companies,
(ii) base salary and salary increases for Named Executive Officers, (iii) achievement of targets and awards under our Incentive Payment Plans, (iv) appropriate overall annual equity grant levels and the structure of these grants, and
(v) special compensation awards to executives who have shown outstanding achievements during the year or on special projects. Mr. Weiss also makes specific recommendations to the Compensation Committee as to how these grants and awards
should be allocated to the Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee gives full consideration to management
recommendations and reviews these recommendations with both J. Richard and Frederic Cook at its meetings before making its own decisions on the compensation to be provided to the executives. The Compensation Committee feels these
recommendations provide valuable insight in making compensation decisions, but has not delegated its exclusive authority to determine matters of executive compensation and benefits. Peer Group Selection The Compensation Committee has authority for
selection of an appropriate comparative peer group for compensation assessment. The Compensation Committee selects and regularly reviews the peer group, with input from management, J. Richard and Frederic Cook. Recommendations for the peer group are
initially developed by management and Frederic Cook from publicly-traded companies headquartered in the United States based on: • similarity of product lines or industry; and • similarity in company size as measured through annual revenue, market capitalization, operating margins and other financial measures of organizational
scope and complexity. 22 Table of Contents The composition of the peer group is evaluated annually and the Compensation Committee set
the peer group designations for use in compensation decisions for the 2011 fiscal year in August 2010. In making recommendations for an appropriate peer group selection, management and Frederic Cook considered companies which: (i) were relative
in size based on revenue between $500 million to $2 billion, (ii) were within the medical device industry, (iii) had a revenue to asset ratio of between 0.5x to 3.0x, and (iv) had a similarity of product lines. Base salary, target bonus compensation, and equity awards for the 2011 fiscal year were guided, in part, by the peer group. This eighteen
company peer group comprises the following companies: American Medical Systems Holdings, Inc. Kinetic Concepts, Inc. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Millipore Corporation Bruker Corporation PerkinElmer, Inc. Conmed Corporation Resmed, Inc. Dentsply International, Inc. Sirona Dental Systems, Inc Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Steris Corporation Haemonetics Corporation Varian, Inc. Hologic, Inc. Waters Corporation Integra Lifesciences Holding Corporation West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. Components of Executive Compensation Base Salary Annual salaries provide a fixed component to executive
compensation and ensure a minimum level of compensation for our executives. Salaries are evaluated annually for appropriateness and generally comprise no more than one-third of target total compensation for our executives. We think this weighting
maintains a competitive compensation program while providing an appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation, with an emphasis on performance-based and long-term compensation. Increases in annual base salary depend on changes in executive responsibility, overall execution of duties throughout the prior fiscal
year and Company performance relative to predetermined performance objectives, internal alignment, and peer group performance. Competitive market changes and conditions are also taken into account. In the 2011 fiscal year, base salary constituted approximately 20-25% of total direct compensation for the Named Executive Officers,
other than Mr. Weiss, whose base salary was just 15% of total direct compensation. Over the past five years, aside from increases for promotions and to bring Mr. Weiss’ salary closer to the median for our peer group, base salaries for
the Named Executive Officers have generally not increased by more than 5% per year. 23 Table of Contents Incentive Payment Plan (IPP) As discussed in more detail in the narrative to the Grants of Plan Based Awards Table on page 31, our Compensation Committee adopts
an annual plan for performance-based cash incentives designed to tie a portion of executive compensation to our short term goals. We consider bonuses tied to annual objectives to provide a useful incentive tool to encourage our executives to meet
short-term business goals, such as budgeted targets for revenue, operating income, cash flow, and earnings per share. Compensation based on these measures encourages our executives to focus on immediate business objectives, creating annual growth
and stockholder returns in balance to long-term strategic objectives. Executives participate at levels set by the
Compensation Committee and designated as percentages of base salary that may be achieved as bonus payments. Under the 2011 Incentive Payment Plan, or IPP, 75% of achievement depended on meeting designated financial targets and 25% of awards were at
the Compensation Committee’s discretion. We feel that this division places strong emphasis on the achievement of measurable, quantifiable business gains, while providing the Compensation Committee with adequate latitude to set discretionary
awards based on special circumstances and individual achievements outside of the quantitative targets. The Committee also has the flexibility to withhold all or a portion of the discretionary element of the bonus if they feel that an
executive’s individual performance does not warrant a full bonus even if the Company has performed well. All of the quantitative factors were capped at 200% of the target. The IPP also provides the Compensation Committee with the option to reduce quantitative awards by up to 25%, regardless of whether
achievement targets were met. This reduction can be made at the Compensation Committee’s discretion if it feels awards based on actual achievement levels are not merited. The Compensation Committee also has the discretion to decrease or cancel
award payments in the event that the first two months of the subsequent fiscal year reflect negative anomalies that are attributable to the fiscal year in which the awards are earned. Target bonus levels for the 2011 IPP comprised 16-21% of total compensation for our Named Executive Officers. For the 2011 fiscal year, award factors under the IPP were defined and weighted as follows: Corporate CooperVision and CooperSurgical Award Factor (Weiss, Midlock & Kaufman) (Weber and Pichotta) Quantitative Factors Revenue 20 % 20 % Operating income 10 % 25 % Earnings per share (EPS) 25 % 10 % Cash flow 20 % 20 % Discretionary Award 25 % 25 % Total Bonus 100 % 100 % All of the quantitative factors were tied to the budget approved by the Board at the beginning of the
fiscal year, as adjusted by acquisitions and/or divestitures approved by the Board or other items at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Achievement for executives employed by our subsidiaries was measured against the approved budgets for
the appropriate subsidiary. The quantitative factors were selected to address what we considered key objectives for management for the 2011 fiscal year. 24 Table of Contents Threshold achievement levels for all factors were set at 85% of budget targets and no award
was paid under the 2011 IPP for any factor that did not achieve this threshold. Bonus achievement for each factor could exceed 100% in the event of extraordinary financial performance, but only if the top two quantitative factors both achieved 95%
of the budget target. For all participants, the maximum total award payment associated with quantitative criteria was capped at 200% of the target awards. Under the 2011 IPP, the Named Executive Officers earned the following bonus amounts: Executive Achievement under 2011 IPP Bonus Paid ($) Target Award as % of Base Salary Actual Award as % of Base Salary Robert S.

Pichotta 154.7 % $ 220,680 45 % 69.6 % (1) Ms. Kaufman’s target award is weighted to reflect an increase in target from 55% to 60% in July 2011. This increase was in connection with her promotion to
Executive Vice President. These awards were balanced between quantitative and discretionary factors as follows: Executive Quantitative Factor Achievement Discretionary Award Total 2011 Achievement Corporate (Weiss, Midlock & Kaufman) 123.5 % 20 % 143.5 % CooperVision (Weber) 107.6 % 15 % 122.6 % CooperSurgical (Pichotta) 129.7 % 25 % 154.7 % Quantitative Awards Based on our exceptional performance in the 2011 fiscal year, the quantitative portion of awards under the 2011 IPP generally exceeded 100% achievement. The awards paid to the Named Executive Officers
were based on achievement of the quantitative factors against budget targets as set out below. A full discussion of our results can be found in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

The
2011 IPP provides the Compensation Committee with flexibility to set the discretionary portion of bonus awards for the Named Executive Officers based on individual performance, our overall Company performance, or other factors the Compensation
Committee deems appropriate. This determination is a subjective decision of the Compensation Committee and is not linked by mathematical formula to achievement levels under the 2011 IPP. For the 2011 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee determined that discretionary awards would not exceed 100% of possible achievement,
i.e. 25%. In making this determination, the Committee noted that, for the 2011 fiscal year, it felt that discretionary awards in excess of the possible 25% achievement were not appropriate because exceptional achievement had been captured in the
quantitative factors mentioned above, and was appropriately rewarded through the bonus multiples associated to the quantitative factors. The Committee elected to approve discretionary achievement levels for all of the Named Executive Officers. The Committee approved a 20% discretionary payment for Messrs. Weiss and Midlock and for Ms.
Kaufman and a 15% discretionary award for Mr. Weber. In making this decision the Compensation Committee considered a number of factors including management achievement of objectives in excess of targets, significantly increased revenues and
operating income, geographic and manufacturing expansions, continued gains in market share and the occurrence of a limited product recall. Mr. Pichotta received a 25% discretionary award in acknowledgement of the continued success of
CooperSurgical, including the successful close of two acquisitions which will provide long-term value to CooperSurgical’s business. 26 Table of Contents 2011 Equity Awards As discussed in more detail in the narrative to the Grants of Plan Based Awards Table on page 31, the Compensation Committee generally makes annual awards of long-term equity incentives to our Named
Executive Officers. In the 2011 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee chose to have the long-term equity incentives take the form of restricted stock units and performance share awards for our Named Executives other than Mr. Weiss.
Mr. Weiss received a performance share award and an award of stock options instead of restricted stock units. The
Compensation Committee chose to grant restricted stock units to our Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Weiss, in the 2011 fiscal year as a means of maintaining the long-term retention value of equity awards in the face of market
volatility and to better balance the value of long-term incentives as a retention tool. This transition reflects a conversion from the majority of our equity awards for our Named Executive Officers in prior years being issued as stock options. The
Compensation Committee considers restricted stock units to offer a stronger retention value because they have a lower level of risk due to guaranteed value upon vesting. Restricted stock units are also expected to provide a more direct link between
our financial growth and executive realization of compensation gains. Mr. Weiss continues to receive stock options in
order to more closely align his interests with our stockholders. Because there is a higher risk that stock options will not maintain long-term compensation value, the Compensation Committee feels that they provide an additional degree of connection
to stockholder interests. The Compensation Committee believes that the unique influence of the CEO’s position warrants compensation that is more “at risk” if stockholder returns are not achieved. All of the restricted stock unit and option awards vest over a four- or five-year period. Although time vesting is not considered a
performance-based award structure, our Compensation Committee considers time-vesting criteria to be an effective award structure for encouraging executive retention while maintaining a link to Company performance. Time-based vesting requires our
executives to continue their service in order to benefit from these awards, and any increased market value realized in the life of the awards directly increases the compensation realized by the executive. Percentage of Total Compensation Value Represented by Equity Awards Stock Options Restricted Stock Units Performance Shares Robert S. Weiss 46% 0% 18% Other Named Executives 0% 30-40% 20-25% Performance Share Awards In addition to time-based equity awards, our Named Executive Officers participate in an annual performance share award program. The Compensation Committee grants performance share awards to provide
additional linkage between executive compensation and achievement of long-term performance goals. The Compensation Committee is closely focused on metrics for executive compensation, both in short-term and long-term award programs, which will result
in positive stockholder returns. The Committee believes that performance share awards that vest only upon achievement of specific future earnings per share targets provide a strong long-term incentive for executives to deliver the targeted results
over time. The performance shares awarded in the 2011 fiscal year have three potential levels of achievement, with a minimum,
target and maximum payable upon achievement of specified gains in earnings per share over a three year period. If the minimum level of achievement is not met, no shares will be awarded. Performance shares comprised 18-25% of the total equity
compensation awarded to the Named Executive Officers. 27 Table of Contents The Compensation Committee believes that these awards reflect the direct influence that our
executives have on our achievement of long-term performance goals, and earnings per share was selected as the target due to the strong link this metric has to stockholder returns. The earnings per share targets set for the award levels for the performance shares awarded in the 2011 fiscal year encourage significant,
but not unreasonable, gains in our growth and earnings. Minimum award levels are set to align with reasonable growth in earnings per share, with target and maximum award amounts designed to set challenging but attainable levels of growth. The
Committee reviews these targets with its compensation consultant and believes the target levels are reasonable and appropriate, and do not encourage any inappropriate risk taking by management to achieve the targets. Stock Ownership Guidelines The Compensation Committee has implemented guidelines for stock ownership by certain executive officers based on position, including the Named Executive Officers. Under these guidelines in the 2011 fiscal
year, Mr. Weiss had a target to hold Cooper common stock valued at three times his annual base salary. Messrs. Midlock and Weber and Ms. Kaufman had targets to hold Cooper common stock valued at twice their annual base salary.
Mr. Pichotta had a target to hold Cooper common stock valued at his annual base salary. The ownership guidelines provide
that subject executives are expected to retain a percentage of shares acquired upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of full-value awards if their ownership is below the established threshold. All Named Executive Officers complied with the
guidelines during the 2011 fiscal year. Tax Deductibility of Compensation Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally provides that publicly held companies may not deduct
compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid in any fiscal year to its chief executive officer and the other three most highly compensated Named Executive Officers employed at the end of the year (other than its chief financial officer). However,
pursuant to regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, certain limited exemptions to Section 162(m) apply with respect to “qualified performance-based compensation.” In the course of structuring our compensation policies, the Compensation Committee considers ways to maintain the tax deductibility of
the compensation for Named Executive Officers. However, the Compensation Committee intends to retain the necessary discretion to compensate executives in a manner in keeping with overall compensation goals and strategies, and may choose to
provide compensation which may not be deductible by reason of Section 162(m). Our equity compensation plan is designed to be performance-based so that full value awards such as the performance awards which vest solely based on performance may
be performance-based compensation and deductible under Section 162(m). Stock options granted at or above market value will also be performance-based compensation and deductible under Section 162(m). However, full value awards which vest
based on time will not be qualified as performance-based and may not be deductible. Our Incentive Payment Plan has not been approved by our stockholders, and therefore bonuses payable under such plan do not qualify as performance-based compensation
under Section 162(m). Conclusion The Compensation Committee believes that each element of compensation and the total compensation provided to each of our Named Executive Officers is reasonable, competitive and appropriate. The value of
the compensation payable to the Named Executive Officers is significantly tied to our performance and returns to our stockholders. The Compensation Committee believes that our compensation programs provide an appropriate mix of elements that will
allow us to continue to attract, retain and motivate a top performing management team, without encouraging inappropriate risk-taking by our executives. 28 Table of Contents E XECUTIVE C OMPENSATION T ABLES Summary Compensation Table The table below shows compensation paid to the individuals who served as our Named Executive Officers during the past fiscal year.

He was promoted to the position of President and Chief Executive
Officer of Cooper Medical, Inc., in January 2012. Narrative to Summary Compensation Table Executive Salaries Base salaries for the Named Executive Officers are generally within median levels for the peer group. Salaries for the Named Executive Officers in the 2011 fiscal year increased about 4-5% over the 2010 fiscal year, in keeping with median compensation levels and overall performance. In July 2011,
Ms. Kaufman received an additional salary increase of approximately 4% in connection with her promotion to Executive Vice President. These increases in base salary correspondingly increased target short-term bonus compensation for the Named
Executive Officers on achievement of our performance goals. Perquisites Our Named Executive Officers receive limited non-salary based compensation. This additional compensation generally takes the form of
automobile allowances and amounts provided in accordance with benefit plans which are also available to most of our employees, such as life insurance and matching contributions to 401(k) retirement accounts. We have also compensated certain of our
executives for spousal travel in connection with Company events. In all cases the Compensation Committee reviews these amounts and takes them into consideration when reviewing overall executive compensation. Approval of perquisites and other
non-salary based compensation is limited and in most cases does not exceed $30,000 annually. 30 Table of Contents Grants of Plan-Based Awards This table presents information regarding the possible awards payable under our 2011 Incentive Payment Plan and the value of certain

Under the IPP, we tie potential annual bonus compensation to the achievement of business goals
derived from our approved fiscal year budget. Management presents a proposed IPP to the Compensation Committee for review, revision, and approval at the beginning of each fiscal year. Participation levels in the IPP are set by the Compensation Committee and represent a designated percentage of base salary for the fiscal
year. That percentage controls the potential award that can be achieved under the IPP. Awards are based on: (i) achievement of specified objectively determined financial targets and (ii) discretionary evaluation by the Compensation
Committee of individual performance. Our Incentive Payment Plan is discussed in more detail in the Compensation Discussion
and Analysis starting on page 24. Equity Awards We provide our Named Executive Officers with equity incentive awards as a tool to promote retention and to connect compensation with our long-term performance and stockholder returns. These awards are
granted under our 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan and any stock options are awarded at 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. Awards may vest over time based on continued service and/or based on performance criteria, and stock options
generally have a 10-year term. The Compensation Committee utilizes a mixture of equity award types, including stock options,
restricted stock units and performance shares. Options and restricted stock units granted in the 2011 fiscal year vest over time. The performance shares granted in the 2011 fiscal year vest on the achievement of specified levels of earnings per
share in the 2013 fiscal year: Performance Level EPS for Fiscal 2013 Award Achievement Outstanding (maximum) > $4.36 150 % Target $4.13 to < $4.36 100 % Minimum $3.91 to <$4.13 50 % Below Threshold <$3.91 0 % Grant Process and Timing The decision of whether to grant equity awards during a given fiscal year is made by the full Board based on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee’s
recommendation addresses whether and to what extent equity grants should be made based on business conditions, an analysis based on the economic value of an estimated total grant amount, accounting costs and stock price volatility. The Compensation
Committee considers the total economic and compensation value of potential awards, effectiveness as a retention tool and effect on stockholder dilution in determining the recommended total amount of awards to be made for the fiscal year. The
Compensation Committee also considers the economic and accounting implications of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (ASC 718), Compensation-Stock Compensation, in its determination of the type of equity and appropriate award
levels for grants. 32 Table of Contents If the Board agrees to grant equity it does so in the aggregate and the Compensation
Committee is charged with determining the specific allocation of awards to the operating units and to individual recipients, including the Named Executive Officers. In setting award amounts for the Named Executive Officers, the Compensation
Committee considers recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer and from J. Richard, as well as historical grant levels based on the role and position of the executive. Grants are generally made in the first quarter of the fiscal year, after
financial results for the prior fiscal year are available. The Compensation Committee may also make periodic grants to new
hires, upon a promotion, or in other circumstances, in its discretion. Additional grants also may be made to accomplish specific retention goals. When such grants are approved, the grant date is set as the date that the award is approved by the
Compensation Committee, unless the award is approved for a promotion or new hire which will occur in the future. In such case, the grant date will be tied to the date of hire or promotion. Grant dates are never set prior to the date of approval by
the Compensation Committee. Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End This table provides information regarding the equity award holdings of the Named Executive Officers as of the end of the 2011 fiscal

Pichotta and Weiss are over age 65, and therefore the present value of their accumulated benefit reflects his actual annual accrued benefit as of October 31, 2011. Narrative to Pension Benefits Table Our Retirement Income Plan, or
RIP, was adopted in December 1983. The majority of our U.S. employees who work at least 1,000 hours per year are covered by the RIP. For services performed after December 31, 1988, members are entitled to an annual retirement benefit equal to
0.60% of base annual compensation up to $10,000, and 1.20% of base annual compensation which exceeds $10,000 but is not in excess of the applicable annual maximum compensation permitted to be taken into account under Internal Revenue Service
guidelines for each year of service. For service prior to January 1, 1989, members are entitled to an annual retirement benefit equal to 0.75% of base annual compensation up to the Social Security Wage Base in effect that year and 1.50% of base
annual compensation in excess of the Social Security Wage Base for each year of service. Based on the current accumulated
benefits for the Named Executive Officers, the estimated annual benefits payable under the RIP upon retirement at the normal retirement age of 65 are as follows: Officer Estimated Annual Benefits Payable (1) Robert S. Weiss $ 62,223 Eugene J. Midlock $ 15,866 John A. Weber $ 62,651 Carol R. Kaufman $ 45,165 Nicholas J. Pichotta $ 48,468 (1) Messrs. Midlock, Pichotta and Weiss are over age 65 and the estimated annual benefits payable reflects their annual payable benefit as of October 31, 2011. Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control During the 2011 fiscal year, we had agreements in place with our Named Executive Officers that govern the terms of post-employment
compensation in the event of a termination of their employment. All except the agreements with Messrs. Weiss and Pichotta are subject to our Change in Control Severance Plan adopted on May 21, 2007. The Change in Control Severance Plan
provides severance 36 Table of Contents benefits to certain of our key employees as recommended by management. Agreements under this plan require prior approval of the Compensation Committee before they are offered to executives. The
Change in Control Severance Plan is designed to be an “employee welfare benefit plan,” as defined in Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA. At the time of this Proxy Statement,
approximately 20 employees have agreements in place under this plan. The following tables provide estimated amounts payable
to each of the Named Executive Officers assuming termination of employment on October 31, 2011. The tables assume that the value at termination of outstanding equity awards is $69.30, which was the fair market value of our common stock on
October 31, 2011. Upon termination of employment, amounts due to the Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Pichotta, will be paid in monthly installments. Amounts due to Mr. Pichotta will be paid in one lump sum within 60 days of
his termination. Robert S. Weiss Our severance agreement with Mr. Weiss originally took effect on August 21, 1989. Under the agreement, Mr. Weiss would be entitled to a payment of up to 150% of his base salary in the event
of his: (i) termination without cause, (ii) termination within 90 days of a change in control event, (iii) voluntary resignation with good reason, or (iv) separation after a request to relocate more than 50 miles from
his current workplace. He would also be entitled to a prorated portion of his bonus under the applicable Incentive Payment Plan, immediate vesting in his outstanding equity awards and his accrued benefits under the Retirement Income Plan, and
continued coverage under our benefits program for up to 18 months. The agreement with Mr. Weiss also provides for
certain limited payments in the event that he voluntarily resigns his position without good reason. Mr. Weiss is required to provide a minimum of 45 days notice of his resignation to receive these payments. Upon proper notice, he can
receive a percentage of his current annual base salary equal to the number of days notice provided divided by 360, to a maximum of 25%. Voluntary Resignation Termination without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason Termination after Change of Control or Separation After Request to

45 days notice. Represents 150% of base salary for the 2011 fiscal year in the event of termination without cause or resignation with good reason. Represents 100% of base salary for the 2011 fiscal year upon termination within 90 days of a
change in control or after a request to relocate. Mr. Weiss’ severance agreement provides that if he
is entitled to payment for any of the above reasons, his estate will receive the same payments in the event of his death. For purposes of estimating payments on death for the above table, the maximum payout of 150% of base salary has been used on
the assumption that severance at this level was triggered immediately prior to 37 Table of Contents his death and his estate is entitled to such payments under the agreement. No severance is automatically paid upon retirement or death under Mr. Weiss’ agreement or Company policy. (2) Represents the bonus award payable to Mr. Weiss under the 2011 Incentive Payment Plan, which was earned in full but not yet paid as of October 31, 2011. Upon

shares which were either vested at October 31st or would be subject to accelerated vesting upon a termination of employment. For purposes of estimating the value of performance shares which have not completed their performance period, it is
assumed that target award levels will be achieved and paid accordingly, except in the event of a change in control which may trigger certain provisions to require payout at maximum achievement. Upon termination without cause, voluntary resignation with good reason, termination after a change in control, or separation after a
request to relocate, Mr. Weiss’ outstanding equity awards which were not vested will immediately become fully vested and exercisable. All awards will be entirely forfeit on voluntary resignation without good reason regardless of notice
provided. In the event of retirement or death, outstanding equity awards will be treated in accordance with the terms of their
associated agreements. Generally, outstanding stock options that are unvested at the date of the holder’s retirement or death will be forfeit. Vested options will remain outstanding and exercisable for a term of three years from the date of
retirement or one year from the date of death. Termination for retirement or upon death will result in payment of a pro rata portion of performance shares which have not completed their performance cycle based on how much of the performance cycle
was completed at termination. (5) Mr. Weiss and his dependents will be eligible to continue participation in our insurance benefit plans until all severance benefits have been paid. Amounts reflect
the value of benefits over the severance period or benefits payable under our life insurance policies in the event of Mr. Weiss’ death. Nicholas J. Pichotta Our employment and severance agreement with
Nicholas J. Pichotta originally took effect on April 26, 1990 and was amended November 1, 1992. Under the agreement, Mr. Pichotta would be entitled to a payment of 100% of his base salary in the event of his: (i) termination by
the Company without cause, (ii) resignation without good reason within 90 days of a change in control event or (iii) voluntary resignation with good reason. Mr. Pichotta’s payment would increase to 150% of his base salary in the event of his: (i) termination within 6 months of a change in control or (ii) separation after a request to
relocate more than 50 miles from his current workplace. In the event of Mr. Pichotta’s death, his estate would be entitled to receive a payment of 200% of his base salary. He would also be entitled to a prorated portion of his bonus under the applicable Incentive Payment Plan, immediate vesting in his
currently accrued benefits under the Retirement Income Plan, continued payment of his automobile allowance for 90 days from the date of termination and continued coverage under the Company’s benefits program for up to 18 months from the date of
termination in the event of termination for any of these reasons. 38 Table of Contents Our agreement with Mr. Pichotta also provides for certain limited payments in the event
that he voluntarily resigns his position without good reason. In the event of such resignation, Mr. Pichotta must provide a minimum of 90 days notice of the resignation to receive these payments. Upon proper notice, he will receive a severance
payment equal to 25% of his annual base salary.

executive’s death. 41 Table of Contents Risk And Executive Compensation Our Compensation Committee has assessed the possible risks related to our executive compensation. Based on this assessment the
Compensation Committee has concluded that our compensation programs do not create unreasonable risk or the likelihood of a material adverse impact on the Company. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee considered possible
compensation-based risks and means by which potential risks may be mitigated, including through the operation of our internal control structure and the Committee’s oversight. The Compensation Committee also considered the structure of our
compensation plans, including the use of a combination of short- and long-term compensation programs, implementation of equity ownership guidelines, capped bonus targets under short-term incentive plans and clawback provisions for short-term bonus
awards. 42 Table of Contents D IRECTOR C OMPENSATION The Compensation Committee reviews and recommends compensation amounts for the Non-Employee Directors and the Board has
responsibility for the approval of compensation amounts based on these recommendations. Directors of a publicly traded company have substantial responsibilities, and time commitments, and with ongoing changes in corporate governance standards,
highly qualified and experienced directors are in high demand; therefore, we seek to provide suitable economic incentives for our directors and to compensate them appropriately for their continued performance, increased responsibilities and
dedication. The Compensation Committee takes these factors into account in making recommendations to the Board with regard to changes in the Non-Employee Director compensation program. The Compensation Committee also receives an analysis from J. Richard regarding Non-Employee Director compensation. The Compensation
Committee reviews and analyzes the information provided by J. Richard in determining whether to recommend changes to the Board. The Board sets total Non-Employee Director compensation at levels it considers appropriate given the competitive
market for qualified directors and the time commitment expected of the Non-Employee Directors. Director compensation is reviewed at least annually and modified as the Board considers necessary or appropriate. Retainers and Committee Chair Compensation We compensate each Non-Employee Director based on service to us, including attendance at meetings and service on committees of the Board. Director compensation is composed of: • An annual cash retainer; • Additional cash retainers for service as a committee chair; • Payment for attendance at meetings of the Board and its Committees; and • Equity grants in the form of stock options and restricted shares. Compensation levels are designed to correspond to the relative responsibility of each director and are regularly reviewed to ensure they
meet this standard. Directors who are also our employees receive no additional compensation for their service as directors. Annual Cash Retainers For the 2011 fiscal year, each Non-Employee Director received an annual retainer of $30,000 for their services. Dr. Rubenstein received an additional retainer of $10,000 for his service as
Lead Director. Mr. Bender also received an additional retainer of $125,000 for his service as Chairman of the Board. Chair
Retainers and Meeting Payments The Non-Employee Directors who served as Committee Chairs received an additional
retainer in recognition of their time devoted to us in this capacity. Retainer amounts are structured to reflect the additional requirements placed on each Committee Chair. Committee Chair Retainers for 2011: Audit Committee Chair (Steven Rosenberg) $17,500 per year Organization and Compensation Committee Chair (Michael Kalkstein) $12,000 per year Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee Chair (Donald Press) $10,000 per year Science and Technology Committee Chair (Stanley Zinberg, M.D.) $10,000 per year 43 Table of Contents The Non-Employee Directors are also compensated for attendance at meetings as follows: Fee per Meeting for 2011: Meetings held in person by the Board or any Committee of the Board $ 2,000 per meeting Meetings held telephonically by the Board or any Committee of the Board and lasting more than 2 hours $ 2,000 per meeting Meetings held telephonically by the Board or any Committee of the Board and lasting less than 2 hours $ 1,000 per meeting In the event that more than one meeting occurred on the same day, Non-Employee Directors were compensated
for each meeting separately. Non-Employee Directors were also compensated for one travel day in connection with meetings at
$2,000 per day, and at a rate of $250 per hour for time spent substantially on work for us. Equity Compensation The Non-Employee Directors participate in the 2006 Directors’ Plan, which provides for annual equity grants that may be made in the
form of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock options, or any combination thereof. The Board believes that Non-Employee Director compensation should contain a significant equity component in order to align director and stockholder
interests. Grant dates, award amounts, and vesting criteria for these annual equity grants are set by the terms of the 2006 Directors’ Plan. The 2006 Directors’ Plan was originally approved by stockholders on March 21, 2006, and was amended and restated in March 2009 and subsequently amended in October 2009, October 2010, and
October 2011. The 2006 Directors’ Plan provides for two equity grants to the Non-Employee Directors each November as follows: (a) a grant of a designated number of stock options on November 1, or the first business day thereafter if the 1 st is on a weekend, with an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair
market value on the date of grant; and (b) a grant of restricted stock on November 15, or the first business day thereafter if the
15 th is on a weekend, which entitles each Non-Employee
Director to purchase a designated number of shares of restricted stock at par value. The restricted stock grant may also take the form of a restricted stock unit, in the discretion of the Board. The 2006 Directors’ Plan also provides that, upon appointment to the Board, new Non-Employee Directors receive a grant of stock
options and restricted stock as specified in the terms of the 2006 Directors’ Plan, prorated for the number of months of service remaining in the fiscal year in which they were appointed. Additional grants under the 2006 Directors’
Plan may be made at the Board’s discretion. The stock options granted to Non-Employee Directors vest and become
exercisable on the first anniversary of the grant date. On November 1, 2010, each Non-Employee Director received a grant of 6,500 stock options, or 7,150 in the cases of the Chairman and the Lead Director, at an exercise price of $49.57, which
became vested and exercisable on November 1, 2011. Restrictions are removed from the Non-Employee Directors’
restricted stock awards on the first anniversary of the grant date. On November 15, 2010, the Non-Employee Directors received a grant of 2,000 shares of restricted stock and restrictions were removed on November 15, 2011. 44 Table of Contents When a Non-Employee Director ceases to serve on the Board, unless they are terminated for
Cause, restrictions are immediately lifted on all of their outstanding restricted shares and their outstanding stock options become immediately exercisable and remain exercisable for three years. Director Compensation Table The following table sets forth the total cash and equity compensation paid to the Non-Employee Directors for their service on the Board
and its committees during the 2011 fiscal year. At present, the Non-Employee Directors are not eligible to participate in our pension programs and no deferred compensation or non-equity incentive plans are available to Non-Employee Directors.

and understanding of our business and operations which provides efficiency and continuity. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers these factors important to their decision to recommend Dr. Zinberg for nomination for
re-election. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR each of the nominees for director presented above. Nominees for director will be elected by a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. The number of votes
cast FOR a nominee must exceed the number of votes cast AGAINST. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast either for or against the nominee and therefore will not affect the outcome of the director elections. 50 Table of Contents P ROPOSAL 2 — R ATIFICATION O F A PPOINTMENT O F I NDEPENDENT R EGISTERED P UBLIC A CCOUNTING F IRM The Audit Committee has appointed the firm of KPMG LLP to act as our independent registered public accounting firm and to audit our
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2012. This appointment will continue at the pleasure of the Audit Committee and is presented to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good governance. In the
event that this appointment is not ratified by our stockholders, the Audit Committee will consider that fact when it selects our independent auditor for the following fiscal year. KPMG LLP has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since our incorporation in 1980, and one or more representatives
of KPMG LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting. These representatives will be provided an opportunity to make a statement at the Annual Meeting if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. The proposal to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2012 fiscal year requires
an affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. 51 Table of Contents P ROPOSAL 3 — A DVISORY V OTE ON E XECUTIVE C OMPENSATION We are requesting stockholder
approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as presented in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning at page 18 and the compensation tables and associated narrative disclosure included in the
discussion of Executive Compensation beginning on page 29. Our executive compensation program has been designed to retain and
incentivize a talented, motivated and focused executive team by providing competitive compensation within our market. We believe that our executive compensation program provides an appropriate balance between salary and “at-risk” forms of
incentive compensation, as well as a mix of incentives that encourage executive focus on both short- and long-term goals as a company without encouraging inappropriate risks to achieve performance. Currently approximately 65-85% of executive
compensation is based on “at-risk” components. We were pleased to receive a favorable vote for our compensation
practices at our 2011 Annual Meeting, with 95% of our stockholders approving our programs. We consider these voting results to affirm stockholder support for our compensation practices and we continue to take steps to maintain alignment between
executive pay and Company performance. Highlights of our program include: • A mixture of salary and incentive compensation that provides for a significant portion of executive compensation to be “at-risk” and
dependent on our performance as a company; • Checks and balances within our compensation packages to balance focus on both short- and long-term goals, encouraging executives to focus on the health
of the company both during the immediate fiscal year and for the future; • Compensation on termination of employment, other than for a change in control, limited for most executives to the standard severance policies used for
all employees; and • Clawback provisions in our short-term incentive compensation programs. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon us as a Company. However, our Compensation Committee, which is responsible for the
design and administration of our executive compensation practices, values the opinions of our stockholders as expressed through your vote on this proposal. The Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of this vote in making future
compensation decisions for our Named Executive Officers. Accordingly, we will present the following resolution for vote at
the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders: “RESOLVED, that the stockholders of The Cooper Companies, Inc. (the
“Company”) approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table and related compensation
tables and narrative disclosure as set forth in our Proxy Statement.” The Board of
Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation program as presented in this Proxy Statement. The proposal to approve our executive compensation program, on an advisory basis, requires an affirmative vote of the majority of the
shares represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. 52 Table of Contents O THER M ATTERS The Board knows of no other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting, but if any such matters properly come before the Annual
Meeting, it is intended that the persons holding the accompanying proxy will vote in accordance with their best judgment. R ECOMMENDATIONS The Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote: • FOR the election of each of the nominees for director named in this Proxy Statement; • FOR ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year ending October 31, 2012;
and • FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as presented in this Proxy Statement. When a properly executed proxy in the form enclosed with this Proxy Statement is returned, the shares will
be voted as indicated or, if no directions are indicated, the shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. By Order of the Board of Directors A. Thomas Bender Chairman of the Board of Directors 53 Table of Contents NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF
