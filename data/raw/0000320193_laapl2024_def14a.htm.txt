        our Chief Executive Officer To our shareholders, Around the world, teams across Apple continue to
innovate on behalf of our users — finding new ways for technology to empower people and enrich their lives. And I’m grateful
for the confidence our shareholders have shown in supporting our mission. Our annual shareholder meeting is an opportunity
to reflect on where we are today, and to look toward a future defined by innovation. We’ll hold this year’s meeting on February
28, 2024, and as always, I hope you’ll join us. It’s been a remarkable year. In 2023, we made
history by introducing the world to Apple’s first spatial computer, Apple Vision Pro — a revolutionary product that seamlessly
blends digital content with the physical world, opening a whole new dimension for our users. We also launched our powerful iPhone 15 lineup
— including the iPhone 15 Pro models — which continues to win over customers around the world with its profound innovations. We’re a company that’s always looking
forward, driven by a belief in the meaningful difference technology can make for our customers. Today — from iPad to Mac,
AirPods to Apple Watch — we’ve never had a stronger lineup of products. And with services like Apple TV+, the App Store, Apple
Music, Apple Pay, and many more, we’ve only expanded the potential and possibility Apple can bring — from helping people find
connection, entertainment and joy, to empowering them to live healthier lives. We’ve done all of this while continuing to
lead with our values in everything we do. That’s why we’ve put our users’ fundamental right to privacy at the center
of everything we do, and continued innovating to protect it. We’ve built accessibility into every product we make from the ground
up, because we believe the best technology should be the best technology for everyone. And we’ve continued to push forward in our
work to build an even more diverse and inclusive Apple, and to carry those values beyond our doors with our Racial Equity and Justice
Initiative. Our teams are also pressing forward to meet the
challenge of climate change. Our corporate operations have run on 100% renewable energy since 2018, and with our latest Apple Watch lineup,
we’ve now launched our first-ever carbon neutral models. Thanks to milestones like these, we’re closer than ever to realizing
Apple 2030 — our goal to become carbon neutral for our supply chain and the lifetime of our products by the end of the decade. As companies and individuals, our values give us
purpose, our goals give us direction, and our progress gives us hope. And at Apple, we’ll continue to innovate in the belief that
— with hope and hard work — there is nothing we can’t achieve. On behalf of all of us at Apple, I want to thank
our shareholders for the confidence they’ve shown in our company, and in the bright future that lies ahead. Tim Cook Back to Contents Apple Values We are committed to demonstrating that business can and should be a force
for good. Achieving that takes innovation, collaboration, and a focus on serving others. It also means leading with our values in the
technology we make, the way we make it, and how we treat people and the planet we all share. We’re always working to leave the world better
than we found it, and to create powerful tools that empower others to do the same. Accessibility We build accessibility features into all of our products, because we
believe that technology should meet people where they are, not the other way around. Education We believe education is a great equalizing force and a powerful source
of opportunity for all. Environment We believe doing right by the planet is good for people, for communities,
and for business. Inclusion & Diversity We’re committed to making our Company more inclusive and diverse. Privacy We believe privacy is a fundamental human right. Racial Equity and Justice We are all accountable for the urgent work of building a more just and
equitable world. Supplier Responsibility We hold our suppliers to the highest standards for labor and human rights,
working across our global supply chain to expand opportunity and empower people. Back to Contents Progress Across our Values At Apple, we see so many possibilities for technology to enrich people’s
lives. This year, leading with the values that have long guided our company, our teams have made those possibilities real. That included
creating experiences that are customizable to the diverse needs of our users with new features for cognitive accessibility, along with
LiveSpeech, Personal Voice, and Point and Speak. We’ve also made key innovations in privacy and safety features to give
users greater control of their data and help protect children, including expanding Communication Safety and launching
Link Tracking Protection and Sensitive Content Warnings. We know that together, we can rise to our biggest challenges as a global
community. And this year, we’ve made progress in empowering others to do better. We equipped students through additional coding
education resources. We propelled entrepreneurs through investments with venture capital funds and financial institutions focused on getting
capital to Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous-owned businesses, backing founders who have historically been cut out of funding opportunities.
And, we supported supplier employees through an additional $50 million commitment to our Supplier Employee Development Fund, designed
to strengthen and scale programs that support worker voice, rights training and education, and skill development opportunities. The values we share at Apple inspire the work we share with everyone. Spotlight on Apple’s 2030 Goal We set an ambitious goal —
to make our products carbon neutral by 2030, across our entire supply chain and the lifetime energy use of our customers’ devices. • Released our first ever carbon neutral products • Secured commitment from over 300 of our suppliers to use 100%
    clean energy for Apple production by 2030 • Welcomed our third impact accelerator class of diverse innovators
    on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy • Introduced a new tool, Grid Forecast, to help inform users
    when their power grid has cleaner energy available • Increased recycled and renewable materials including: • 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosures of our MacBooks, Apple
    TV Siri Remote, and Apple Watch • 100% recycled cobalt in our
    iPhone 15, carbon neutral Apple Watch     Series 9, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 batteries • Expanded recycled gold, tin, and tungsten in our Apple Watch
    Series 9 • A brand-new textile, FineWoven, made from 68% post-consumer
    recycled content, a step towards ending the use of leather across product lines We share progress on our values through our websites,
  reports, and other public announcements. For more information, see the section entitled “Our Commitment to Transparency”

experienced leadership team is a key factor of Apple’s long-term success. We have a straightforward and effective executive
compensation program that incorporates sound policies and best practices and delivers a majority of our named executive officers’
compensation through incentives that are aligned with shareholder interests and Company performance. Aligned with Shareholder Interests and Company Performance ● Annual
        cash incentive opportunities are capped and have challenging performance goals tied to key measures of overall company performance
        and profitability. ● Performance-based RSUs generally vest based on Apple’s total shareholder return relative to companies in the S&P 500 over a three
        year-performance period. ● Shareholders
        have an opportunity to cast an advisory say on pay vote each year on the compensation of our named executive officers and indicated
        strong support for our executive compensation program at the 2023 Annual Meeting, including the 2023 changes to our CEO’s compensation,
        as described below. 2023 CEO Compensation Changes The People and Compensation
Committee evaluates our executive compensation program each year. The results of the Say on Pay advisory vote at the 2022 Annual
Meeting led to broader shareholder engagement on executive compensation. The People and Compensation Committee balanced shareholder
feedback, Apple’s exceptional performance, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback
received. It then approved the target annual compensation of our named executive officers for 2023, including the following changes
to CEO compensation, which Mr. Cook supported, and which the People and Compensation Committee believes are responsive to shareholder
feedback, while continuing to align pay with performance and recognize Mr. Cook’s outstanding leadership and the exceptional
long-term results he delivers to shareholders. Target
    CEO Pay Mr.
    Cook’s 2023 target total compensation was $49 million, a reduction of over 40% from his 2022 target total compensation.
    Taking into consideration Apple’s comparative size, scope, and success, the People and Compensation Committee also intends
    to position Mr. Cook’s annual target compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles relative to our primary peer
    group for future years. CEO Equity Mix The
    portion of performance-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook was increased from 50% to 75% of
    his 2023 target equity award and the portion of his performance-based RSUs will be at least 75% of his target equity awards
    for future years. CEO Retirement
    Vesting The
    time-based RSUs awarded to Mr. Cook in 2023 provide for pro-rata instead of full vesting in the event of retirement during
    the term of the award and only if retirement occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. The People and Compensation
    Committee intends to maintain this same structure for future years.

    and inclusion and live by its core values, including accessibility, inclusion and diversity, and privacy. These efforts, many
    of which began years ago, are reflected in Apple’s current policies and practices, which are detailed in Covington’s
    report. Workers’ Rights Assessment Apple
    published a Workers’ Rights Assessment report prepared by former U.S. Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the
    United Nations Human Rights Council, Keith Harper, and a team from Jenner & Block LLP. The report reviews Apple’s
    efforts to comply with its Human Rights Policy in the United States as it relates to workers’ rights to freedom of association
    and collective bargaining, and describes how Apple’s efforts to comply with its Human Rights Policy are embedded in
    its policies and practices.

        Board is made up of directors with diverse skills, qualities, attributes, and experiences to effectively address Apple’s
        evolving needs and represent the best interests of Apple’s shareholders. ● The
        Board actively reviews its composition to support Apple’s long-term strategic goals. As part of its succession planning and
        refreshment, the Board has recommended one new nominee at each of our 2021 and 2022 Annual Meetings and nominated Wanda Austin

        executive compensation program is designed to align pay with performance, taking into account shareholder feedback and interests. ● The
        compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2023 reflects the strength of our annual financial results and stock price
        performance. FOR 77 4 EEO Policy Risk Report ● We
        are committed to nurturing a culture where every great idea can be heard and where everyone belongs, including those with differing
        viewpoints and ideologies. ● Our
        policies, practices, and trainings already address the proposal’s concern, and a report on potential risks to the Company
        of omitting “viewpoint” and “ideology” from our EEO Policy would not provide material additional information
        to shareholders. AGAINST 83 5 Report on Ensuring Respect for Civil Liberties ● Apple
        is committed to respecting human rights, including civil rights, freedom of expression, and access to information, and we review
        our procedures for administering the App Store for alignment with this commitment. ● We

        achieved gender pay equity globally, as well as pay equity by race and ethnicity in the United States, and in 2022, we also achieved
        pay equity at the intersections of gender and race and ethnicity in our U.S. workforce. ● We
          provide robust disclosure regarding our progress on diverse representation on our Inclusion and Diversity website, and we believe our programs, policies, and transparency represent
        a more meaningful approach to pay equity and diverse representation than the approach set forth in the proposal. AGAINST 89 7 Report on Use of AI ● We are committed to responsibly advancing our products and services that use AI,
        have a robust approach to addressing ethical considerations across our business operations, and already provide resources and transparency
        on our approach to artificial intelligence and machine learning. ● The
        scope of the requested report is extremely broad and could encompass disclosure of strategic plans and initiatives harmful to our
        competitive position and would be premature in this developing area. AGAINST 93 8 Congruency Report on Privacy and Human
        Rights ● We
        are deeply committed to respecting human rights and are transparent about our approach to complex situations and prioritizing engagement. ● The

Stock ownership guidelines We have robust stock ownership guidelines for our directors and executive officers. Shareholder engagement We have a comprehensive year-round shareholder engagement program. Access to management Our Board has significant interaction with senior management and access to other employees. Time commitment policy The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews each director’s various time commitments. Financial expertise The Board has determined that each Audit and Finance Committee member qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as that term is defined under SEC rules. Continuing education and training Our Board regularly receives training and updates on ethics, compliance, and governance. Succession planning Our Board regularly reviews Board and executive succession planning. Executive sessions All quarterly Board and committee meetings include executive sessions during which no members of management are present.

officer and other senior management in the competent and ethical operation of Apple and seeks to ensure that the long-term interests
of shareholders are being served. Directors are expected to take a proactive, focused approach to ensure Apple is committed to
business success through the maintenance of high standards of responsibility and ethics. Board Independence Apple’s Corporate Governance Guidelines
require a majority of Board members to be independent. The Board has determined that all Board members and nominees, other than
Mr. Cook, are independent under applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). Apple’s Board has a standing Audit
and Finance Committee (the “Audit Committee”), People and Compensation Committee (the “People and Compensation
Committee”), and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the “Nominating Committee”). The Board has determined
that all committee members are independent under applicable Nasdaq and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules
for committee memberships, and that each member of the Audit Committee also meets the additional independence criteria set forth
in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Board and Committee Structure Apple regularly reviews the Board’s
leadership structure and the responsibilities and composition of its standing committees. The structure and composition of Apple’s
Board and its committees are intended to leverage the diverse perspectives of the Board members and promote effective oversight. The Board believes its current leadership
structure, in which the roles of Chair and CEO are separated, best serves Apple’s overall corporate structure and the Board’s
ability to carry out its roles and responsibilities on behalf of Apple’s shareholders, including its oversight of management
and corporate governance matters. The Board also believes that the current structure allows our CEO to focus on managing Apple,
while leveraging our independent Chair’s experience to drive accountability at the Board level. The current membership and function of each
standing committee is described on the following page. Each committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, which
is available at investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance . Each committee reviews and
assesses its charter annually.

corporate and product strategy and seeks to ensure the long-term interests of Apple and its shareholders are being served. The
Board believes that evaluating the executive team’s management of the risks confronting Apple is one of its most important
areas of oversight. In carrying out this responsibility, the Board is assisted by its committees, each of which considers risks
within its areas of primary responsibility and expertise and apprises the full Board of significant matters and management’s
response. Board of Directors Directly oversees corporate and product strategy,
        executive succession planning, and other matters reserved to the full Board. Reviews and discusses with management significant
        risks affecting Apple, including matters escalated by its committees from within their respective areas of direct oversight. Audit Committee Oversees financial matters, business
        conduct, and legal and regulatory compliance, including antitrust matters, political expenditures, cybersecurity, and
        tax matters, and has primary responsibility for assisting the Board with risk oversight. People and Compensation Committee Oversees the design and administration
        of compensation programs and policies and has primary responsibility for assisting the Board with oversight of matters
        relating to Apple’s people and teams. Nominating Committee Oversees Board structure, governance,
        and independence, and has primary responsibility for assisting the Board with oversight of environmental and social matters. Management Led by our CEO and executive team, develops
        and executes our business strategy, manages operations, implements and supervises day-to-day risk management processes, and
        reports to the Board and its committees on significant matters. Internal Audit Directly overseen by the Audit
        Committee and operating pursuant to a charter, which is reviewed and approved annually by the Audit Committee, identifies
        and helps mitigate risk, and improves internal controls. Enterprise Risk Management Program Designed to identify, assess, and
        monitor Apple’s business risks, including financial, operational, compliance, and reputational risks. The program
        is supported by a Risk Oversight Committee consisting of our Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Head of Business
        Assurance, and other senior business leaders that assists the Audit Committee with its general responsibility for overseeing
        enterprise risk management. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 24 Selected Areas of Oversight Compliance and Business Conduct The Audit Committee regularly reviews and discusses with management Apple’s compliance and business conduct risks. Apple’s Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for the development, review, and execution of Apple’s Compliance and Business Conduct program and regularly reports to the Audit Committee. Environment and Climate The Board reviews and discusses updates on environmental matters with Apple’s Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, who is responsible for the development, review, and execution of plans designed to minimize Apple’s impact on the environment. These reports include updates on Apple’s progress towards environmental and climate goals and the environmental impact of our products and operations. The Nominating Committee oversees Apple’s strategies, policies, and practices relating to environmental and social matters. Human Rights The
        Board adopted Apple’s human rights policy — Our Commitment to Human Rights. The policy governs how
        we treat everyone, including our customers, employees, business partners, and people at every level of our
        supply chain. Apple identifies salient human rights risks through internal risk assessments and external industry-level third-party audits. Additionally, the policy requires Apple to maintain active communication channels
        with rights holders and other stakeholders. The Board is responsible for overseeing and periodically reviewing
        our Human Rights Policy. Apple’s General Counsel is responsible for its ongoing implementation, and
        reports to the Board and its committees on any significant issues identified during the diligence process and
        Apple’s progress. The
        Board oversaw Apple’s recently completed Civil Rights Assessment, published in July 2023 and Workers’
        Rights Assessment, published in December 2023. People and Teams The
        Board takes an active role in overseeing matters related to our people and teams, including with respect to inclusion
        and diversity, culture and employee engagement, talent recruitment, development, and retention, and has
        allocated direct responsibilities for this area of oversight to the People and Compensation Committee. Additionally,
        Apple’s People and Compensation Committee oversees risks related to Apple’s compensation programs.
        Each year, the People and Compensation Committee evaluates whether the design and operation of Apple’s
        compensation programs or policies encourage our executive officers or our employees to take unnecessary
        or excessive risks. In establishing and reviewing Apple’s compensation programs for risk, the People
        and Compensation Committee considers program features that mitigate against potential risks for our executive
        officers, such as fixed base salaries; goals that are tied to specific company financial measures and payout
        caps for the annual cash incentive program; clawbacks for our cash and equity incentives; the quantity and
        mix of long-term performance-based and time-based equity incentives; and stock ownership requirements.
        The People and Compensation Committee also generally considers the program features that mitigate
        potential risks for our non-executive officer employees. In its annual review, the People and Compensation
        Committee concluded that Apple’s executive compensation programs and policies continue to provide
        an effective and appropriate mix of incentives to help ensure performance is focused on long-term shareholder
        value creation, and do not encourage short-term risk taking at the expense of long-term results or create
        risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Apple. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 25 Privacy and Data Security The Audit Committee regularly reviews and discusses with management Apple’s privacy and data security risks. The Audit Committee receives regular updates from management, including Apple’s Head of Information Security. Additionally, the Audit Committee reviews reports on privacy and data security matters from Apple’s General Counsel, and from the heads of Compliance and Business Conduct, Business Assurance, and Internal Audit. Apple also has a management Privacy Steering Committee chaired by Apple’s General Counsel, with members including Apple’s Senior Vice Presidents of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, Software, and Services, and a cross-functional group of senior representatives from Services, Software Engineering, Product Marketing, Corporate Communications, and Privacy Legal. The Privacy Steering Committee sets privacy standards for teams across Apple and acts as an escalation point for addressing privacy compliance issues. Regulatory and Antitrust Compliance Apple’s full Board takes an active role in overseeing legal and regulatory risks related to Apple’s business. The Board receives regular updates from Apple’s General Counsel and Vice President of Product and Regulatory Law on legal and regulatory developments affecting the Company, including updates on legislative developments, government investigations, litigation, and other legal proceedings. Supply Chain The Board reviews and discusses with management reports regarding Apple’s supply chain and operations. These reports include updates from Apple’s Senior Vice President, Operations on Apple’s supply chain management, and our program to oversee Apple’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards.

These reports include updates on significant domestic and international tax-related developments, and international tax policy.

Each member of the Board who served during 2023 attended or participated in 75% or more of the aggregate of (i) the total
number of meetings of the Board held during 2023, and (ii) the total number of meetings held by each committee of the Board on
which the member served during 2023. Apple expects all of its directors to attend
the Annual Meeting. All directors attended the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders (the “2023 Annual Meeting”). Annual Board and Committee Self-Evaluations The Board conducts an annual self-evaluation
to assess whether the Board, its committees, and each member of the Board are working effectively, and to provide an opportunity
to reflect upon and improve processes and effectiveness. The Nominating Committee designs and establishes
the overall evaluation framework, and Dr. Levinson, the independent Chair of the Board, leads the evaluation interviews and feedback
sessions. Dr. Levinson conducts one-on-one discussions with each director to obtain their assessment of the effectiveness and performance
of the Board and its committees. Additional discussion topics include Board and committee composition and refreshment; timing,
agenda, and content of Board and committee meetings; Board dynamics and function; peer reviews of other members; and executive
succession planning. Board members are also invited to discuss the performance of Dr. Levinson directly with the Chair of the Nominating
Committee. A summary identifying any themes or issues that have emerged is presented to the Board on an anonymous basis. Each committee conducts its own annual self-evaluation and reports the results to the Board. Each committee’s evaluation includes an assessment of the committee’s
compliance with Apple’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and the committee’s charter. Related Party Policy and Transactions The Board has
adopted a written policy for approval of transactions between Apple and its directors, director nominees, executive officers, greater
than 5% beneficial owners of Apple’s common stock or any other class of Apple’s equity securities, and each of their
respective immediate family members, where the amount involved in the transaction exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed $120,000
in a single fiscal year and the related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest in the transaction (other than solely
as a result of being a director or less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A copy of this policy is available at investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance .
The policy provides that the Audit Committee must review transactions subject to the policy and determine whether to approve or
ratify those transactions. Certain types of transactions are deemed pre-approved pursuant to standing pre-approval guidelines
established by the Audit Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee has delegated authority to its Chair to pre-approve or
ratify transactions under certain circumstances. A summary of new transactions covered by standing pre-approvals or transactions
approved or ratified by the Chair of the Audit Committee, if any, is provided to the Audit Committee for its review. In reviewing
transactions subject to the policy, the Audit Committee or the Chair of the Audit Committee, as applicable, considers (as it deems
appropriate for the circumstances): ● The nature and extent of the related person’s interest in the transaction; ● The approximate dollar value involved in the transaction; ● The approximate dollar value of the related person’s interest in the transaction without
regard to the amount of any profit or loss; ● Whether the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of Apple’s business; ● The material terms of the transaction, including whether the transaction with the related person
is proposed to be, or was entered into, on terms no less favorable to Apple than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated
third-party; ● The business purpose of, and the potential benefits to Apple of, the transaction; Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 27 ● Whether the transaction would impair the independence of a non-employee director; ● Required public disclosure, if any; and ● Any other information regarding the transaction or the related person in the context of the proposed
transaction that would be material to the Audit Committee’s decision, in its business judgment, in light of the circumstances
of the particular transaction. Several of Apple’s Board members and
executive officers serve as directors or executive officers of other organizations, including organizations with which Apple has
commercial and charitable relationships. Apple does not believe that any director or nominee had a direct or indirect material
interest in any relationships during 2023 and through the date of this Proxy Statement. A family member of our Chief Operating Officer
is employed by Apple and received total compensation in excess of $120,000 for the period from the beginning of fiscal year 2023
through the date of the filing of this Proxy Statement. The family member’s compensation was established by Apple in accordance
with our compensation practices applicable to employees with comparable qualifications and responsibilities and holding similar
positions. Business Conduct Policy Apple seeks to conduct business ethically,
honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws. Apple’s code of ethics, entitled, “Business Conduct: The way we do
business,” set outs the principles that guide Apple’s business practices — honesty, respect, confidentiality,
and compliance. The code applies to all employees, including Apple’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
and principal accounting officer. Relevant sections of the code also apply to the Board. Apple expects its suppliers, contractors,
consultants, and other business partners to follow the principles set forth in the code when providing goods and services to Apple
or acting on its behalf. The code is available at apple.com/compliance/pdfs/Business-Conduct-Policy.pdf . Apple intends to disclose any changes to or waivers from this code by posting to our website if disclosure is
required by SEC or Nasdaq rules. Apple’s code is managed by the Business
Conduct organization, under the oversight of Apple’s Chief Compliance Officer. Employees are required to complete training
on the code upon joining Apple and annually thereafter. With input from relevant stakeholders and executive leadership, we regularly
review and update Apple’s code and related policies to ensure they provide clear, actionable guidance to our employees, executive
officers, and directors. Communications with the Board Any matter intended for the Board, or for
any individual member of the Board, should be directed to Apple’s Secretary at One Apple Park Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino,
CA 95014 USA, with a request to forward the communication to the intended recipient. In general, any shareholder communication
delivered to Apple for forwarding to Board members will be forwarded in accordance with the shareholder’s instructions. Apple
reserves the right to not forward to Board members any abusive, threatening, or otherwise inappropriate materials.

group of highly qualified leaders in their respective fields. All of our directors have senior leadership experience at large domestic
or multinational companies. In these positions, they have gained significant and diverse management experience, including in the
areas of strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting, compliance, risk management, and leadership development.
They also have in-depth public company experience serving as executive officers, or on boards of directors and board committees,
and a robust understanding of corporate governance practices and trends. In addition, many of our directors have experience as
directors or trustees of significant academic, research, nonprofit, and philanthropic institutions, and bring unique perspectives
to the Board. The Board and the Nominating Committee believe
the skills, qualities, attributes, and experiences of our directors provide Apple with business acumen and a diverse range of perspectives
to effectively address Apple’s evolving needs, oversee senior management in the competent and ethical operation of Apple,
and represent the best interests of Apple’s shareholders. The Board considers its composition and refreshment
in the context of Apple’s long-term strategic goals and seeks to thoughtfully manage the pace of change and refreshment of
its members over time. Since 2021, the Board has added two new members, Monica Lozano and Alex Gorsky, and this year has nominated
Wanda Austin for election at our 2024 Annual Meeting. The Board has adopted a policy that directors
generally may not stand for reelection after attaining age 75. After years of dedicated and valuable service, James Bell and Al
Gore will be retiring from the Board effective as of the 2024 Annual Meeting, having reached the age of 75. In consideration of
the significant recent transitions in board composition and the value of retaining directors who have developed deep insights into
the Company during their tenure, the Board determined that it would be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders to ask
Ron Sugar to stand for re-election at the 2024 Annual Meeting, although he has attained the age of 75. As Chair of the Audit Committee,
Dr. Sugar has a significant technical and leadership role on the Board, which the Board took into consideration in its succession
planning. Dr. Sugar also brings to the Board executive leadership experience as a former chairman and chief executive officer of
a large international public company, financial expertise as a former chief financial officer, experience in worldwide operations,
understanding of advanced technology, experience with government relations and public policy, and a global business perspective
from his tenure at global companies and his service on other boards. New for 2023 Refreshment Highlight Our Board regularly reviews Board succession planning to maintain the diverse skills, qualities, attributes, and experiences that effectively address the Company’s evolving needs and represent the best interests of Apple’s shareholders. The Board has nominated Wanda Austin for election at our 2024 Annual Meeting. Dr. Austin brings to the Board executive leadership experience through her service as president and chief executive officer of a large research and development organization, significant expertise in advanced technology and innovation, experience with government relations and public policy, and a global business perspective from her service on other boards. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 31 Director Selection and Evaluation The Nominating Committee oversees board succession
planning and recruitment of potential candidates. The Nominating Committee considers candidates who are recommended by its members,
by other Board members, by shareholders, and by management, as well as those identified by third-party search firms retained to
assist in identifying and evaluating possible candidates. In evaluating potential nominees to the Board, the Nominating Committee
considers, among other things: independence, character, ability to exercise sound judgment, demonstrated leadership, ability and
willingness to commit sufficient time to the Board, and relevant skills and experience in the context of the Board’s evolving
needs. The Nominating Committee also considers the diversity of the Board overall with respect to age, disability, gender identity
or expression, ethnicity, military veteran status, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, and other backgrounds and
experiences. The Nominating Committee is committed to actively seeking out, and will instruct any search firm it engages to identify,
individuals who will contribute to the overall diversity of the Board to be included in the pool of candidates from which nominees
to the Board are selected. 63% of nominees self-identify as women or members of an underrepresented community, and 50% of Board
leadership positions are held by women. The Board monitors the mix of skills and experience of its directors to help ensure it
has the necessary tools to perform its oversight function effectively. The Nominating Committee, with the assistance of an outside
search firm, and input from our independent directors, Chair of the Board, and CEO, identified Wanda Austin as a potential candidate
and recommended her to the Board. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require
an annual review by the Nominating Committee of each director’s various time commitments, including their primary occupation,
service on other public company boards and board committees, leadership positions on other boards, as well as service with private
company boards and non-profit organizations. Following its review in 2023, the Nominating Committee has determined that, in its
view, no director currently has time commitments that would prevent them from properly discharging their duties as directors. The Nominating Committee evaluates candidates
recommended by shareholders using the same criteria it applies to evaluate other candidates. Shareholders who wish to recommend
a director candidate should submit the candidate’s name and background information in writing to our Secretary at One Apple
Park Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA. In addition, the proxy access provisions in our bylaws provide that a shareholder,
or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least 3% of our outstanding shares continuously for at least three years, may nominate
director nominees constituting up to 20% of Apple’s Board for inclusion in our proxy statement. Nominating shareholders and
nominees must satisfy the requirements set forth in our bylaws, which can be found at investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance .

        leadership position, including as a chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or other senior leadership role, equips directors
        with valuable insight into organizational behavior and processes and a deep understanding of the various aspects of modern organizations,
        including strategic planning, financial reporting, compliance, values, and culture. Corporate Governance Experience on public company boards promotes
        an understanding of the dynamics and operation of a corporate board and its relationship with the chief executive officer and other
        senior management, as well as deep knowledge of corporate governance practices and policies and an appreciation of how they can
        impact the Company. Risk Management Experience identifying, managing, or mitigating
        risks develops a director’s ability to appreciate, anticipate, and effectively oversee the Company’s risk management. Financial Knowledge of financial markets, financing,
        and financial reporting processes helps our directors understand and oversee our financial position, results of operations, and
        related financial reporting, as well as our broader financing activities and capital structure. Strategic Skills People and Culture Because Apple operates in a very competitive
        talent market, directors with experience managing people and teams, including recruitment, retention, development, compensation,
        and incentivization of key talent, provide strategic value in overseeing our efforts to recruit, retain, and develop our people
        and teams and in determining compensation for our CEO and other senior executives. Global Business and Operations Experience in global business and operations,
        including exposure to global business cultures, consumer preferences, and economic, regulatory, and political conditions, helps
        directors oversee Apple’s global footprint and complex supply chain. Innovation and Technology Directors with an understanding of innovation
        and technology, including through experience in technology-related businesses or driving scientific innovation, are strategically
        equipped to oversee Apple’s innovation-focused product and services roadmap. Brand and Marketing Experience with the marketing and branding
        of products, building brand awareness, and enhancing corporate reputation can help directors successfully guide and advise management,
        and oversee related efforts. Privacy and Security At Apple, we believe privacy is a fundamental
        human right. Directors with expertise in information security, data privacy, and cybersecurity are uniquely qualified to oversee
        our product and services roadmap as well as privacy and cybersecurity risks. Public Policy and Government Experience in government relations, regulatory
        matters, or regulated industries provides a valuable perspective as Apple operates in an increasingly regulated global environment. Environment and Climate At Apple, we believe business can and should
        be a force for good. Directors with experience leading efforts to mitigate climate change and other environmental impacts are well
        qualified to oversee our environmental programs and product development.

Within Last Five Years: Swiss Re Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 38 Compensation of Directors Members of the Board who are not Apple employees
(“Non-Employee Directors”) receive compensation for their service on the Board. As an Apple employee, Mr. Cook, our
CEO, does not receive compensation for his service on the Board. The People and Compensation Committee annually reviews the total
compensation of our Non-Employee Directors and each element of our Non-Employee Director compensation program. As part of this
process, the People and Compensation Committee evaluates market data provided by its independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance
LLC (“Pay Governance”), and makes a recommendation to the Board. The Board determines the form and amount of Non-Employee
Director compensation after reviewing the People and Compensation Committee’s recommendation. The Apple Inc. Non-Employee
Director Stock Plan (the “Director Stock Plan”) provides for an annual limit of $1.5 million for all compensation paid
or granted to a Non-Employee Director. Cash Retainers Our Non-Employee Directors receive an
annual cash retainer of $100,000. In 2023, Pay Governance recommended to the People and Compensation Committee an annual
increase of $10,000 to the cash retainer received by each of our chairs, with the first installment paid with the September
2023 quarterly installment. The People and Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, the increase. In 2023,
the Chair of the Board, Dr. Levinson, received an additional cash retainer of $175,000; the Chair of the Audit Committee, Dr.
Sugar, received an additional cash retainer of $37,500; the Chair of the People and Compensation Committee, Ms. Jung,
received an additional cash retainer of $32,500; and the Chair of the Nominating Committee, Ms. Wagner, received an
additional cash retainer of $27,500. All retainers are paid in quarterly installments. Equity-Based Awards A substantial portion of each Non-Employee
Director’s annual retainer is in the form of equity awards. Under the Director Stock Plan, Non-Employee Directors are granted
restricted stock units (“RSUs”) on the date of each annual meeting of shareholders (each, an “Annual Director Award”). All Annual Director Awards
vest on February 1 of the following year, subject to continued service on the Board through the vesting date. For 2023, the number
of RSUs underlying each Annual Director Award was 1,852, which was determined by dividing $275,000 by the per share closing price
of Apple’s common stock on the date of grant. A Non-Employee Director who is newly appointed
to the Board other than in connection with an annual meeting of shareholders will receive a grant of RSUs upon appointment (an
“Initial Director Award”), except that a Non-Employee Director who first joins the Board on or after February 1 of
a particular year and prior to the annual meeting for that year, or a director who was an employee of Apple immediately prior to
first becoming a Non-Employee Director, will not receive an Initial Director Award. The number of RSUs subject to each Initial
Director Award is determined in the same manner as described above for Annual Director Awards, but the award is pro-rated based
on the portion of the vesting period that has passed since the last annual meeting. Initial Director Awards are scheduled to vest
on the next February 1 following the grant of the award. Each RSU award granted under the Director
Stock Plan is credited with an amount equal to any ordinary dividend paid by Apple, multiplied by the total number of RSUs subject
to the award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for the dividend. The amounts credited to each RSU are referred
to as “dividend equivalents.” Any dividend equivalents credited to RSUs granted under the Director Stock Plan will
be subject to the same vesting, payment, and other terms and conditions as the RSUs to which the dividend equivalents relate. The
dividend equivalents are meant to treat the RSU award holders consistently with shareholders. Equipment and Other
Business-Related Programs Apple has an equipment program for the Board
under which each Non-Employee Director is eligible to receive, upon request and free of charge, one of each new product introduced
by Apple, and is eligible to purchase additional equipment at a discount. Each Non-Employee Director is also eligible to participate
in Apple’s matching gifts program to the same extent as Apple employees. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 39 Deferred Compensation Plan We maintain the Apple Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred
Compensation Plan”), under which eligible participants, including our Non-Employee Directors, may elect to defer a portion
of their eligible compensation, subject to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan is unfunded
and unsecured. We do not provide any matching contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan or allow for deferral of RSUs.
In 2023, Ms. Lozano participated in the Deferred Compensation Plan and deferred a portion of her annual cash retainer. None of
our other Non-Employee Directors deferred compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan in 2023. Stock Ownership Guidelines Apple has stock ownership guidelines for our CEO, executive officers,
and Non-Employee Directors. Under the guidelines, each Non-Employee Director is expected, within five years after joining the Board,
to own shares of Apple’s common stock that have a value equal to five times their annual cash retainer for serving as a director.
Shares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with, or separately by, the individual’s spouse, or held in
trust for the benefit of the individual, the individual’s spouse, or the individual’s children. Other than Mr. Gorsky,
who joined the Board in calendar year 2021, each Non-Employee Director currently owns shares of Apple’s common stock that
have a value at least equal to five times their annual cash retainer. Director Compensation—2023 The following table shows information regarding the compensation
earned or paid during 2023 to Non-Employee Directors who served on the Board during the year. Mr. Cook’s compensation is
shown in the table entitled “Summary Compensation Table—2023, 2022, and 2021” and the related tables under the

    Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (“FASB ASC 718”). The grant date fair value for RSUs
    is measured based on the closing price of Apple’s common stock on the date of grant. Each Non-Employee Director serving
    on the Board on March 10, 2023 received an Annual Director Award of 1,852 RSUs with a grant date fair value for each RSU of
    $148.50. Each Non-Employee Director serving on the Board as of September 30, 2023 held 1,852 unvested RSUs. (2) The amounts shown reflect the value of one or more products received under

Directors, we want to thank you for your investment in our Company — and for your continued support for its people, its
leadership, and the values that guide it. Apple is a company where people come together to do
the best work of their lives. Behind every innovation, there are so many talented teams who collaborate to create incredible products
and services for Apple users around the world. And following the expansion of our charter in 2023, the People and Compensation Committee
will do even more to support Apple’s teams — including oversight of our investments in employee engagement, inclusion and
diversity, talent recruitment, development, and retention. Of course, Apple’s leadership plays a
key role in fostering a culture of collaboration — driving innovation and charting a course for the future. Our
executive compensation program aims to reflect these important contributions, from leaders whose vision is so essential to
Apple’s continued success. It also reflects feedback from our shareholders — which is an important consideration
every year as we evaluate the compensation of our executive officers. That includes our Chief Executive Officer
— Tim Cook — whose outstanding leadership has been crucial to Apple’s success and its enduring track record
of innovation. Tim continues to distinguish himself as a responsible, thoughtful, and visionary leader guiding Apple. Under
his leadership, the company continues to empower people with innovative technology, while staying true to the values and the
spirit of ingenuity that have long guided its work, and over the past three years, Apple’s total shareholder return is
more than 55% — nearly 20% above the S&P 500. As a committee, we have a responsibility to
ensure that the compensation of our CEO reflects the success of our Company and the excellence of its leadership. Last year,
our committee shared its intention to set Tim’s compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles of target CEO pay at
our primary peer companies, and 89% of votes cast on the Say on Pay proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of
Apple’s executive compensation program. We believe positioning Tim’s compensation at this level is responsive to
shareholder feedback and appropriate given Apple’s relative size and scope compared to our peer companies. As we look ahead, we’re grateful
to our community of shareholders for their engagement, which will continue to shape the future of our executive
compensation program. And together, we’ll continue to support the success of Apple’s teams, its leaders, and its
vital work to create technology that empowers people and enriches their lives. Sincerely, Andrea Jung      Al Gore      Alex Gorsky      Art

        Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“CD&A”) explains the guiding principles,
        policies, and practices upon which our executive compensation program is based, and the 2023 compensation paid to our named
        executive officers. Summary of 2023 Named Executive Officer Compensation Motivating and retaining a talented and
experienced leadership team is a key factor in Apple’s long-term success. We have a consistent and effective executive
compensation program that incorporates sound policies and best practices. We also believe that the compensation of our named
executive officers should reflect the strength of our financial results and our commitment to values-driven leadership. The
compensation paid to our executive officers in 2023 aligns with the continued strength of our financial results in an uneven
macroeconomic environment and the significant progress made across our core values and key community initiatives. The vast majority of our named executive officers’ compensation
is delivered through long-term equity awards. The performance-based equity awards that vested in 2023 reflected Apple’s exceptional
stock price performance for the three fiscal year period from the start of 2020 through the end of 2022. Apple’s total shareholder return
relative to other companies in the S&P 500 (“Relative TSR”) was at the 98th percentile for this performance period. As
a result, in 2023 each of our named executive officers, other than Mr. Cook who did not have a performance-based RSU award scheduled to
vest in 2023, vested in the maximum number of performance-based RSUs. Our 2023 Named Executive Officers Tim Cook Chief Executive Officer Luca Maestri Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Kate Adams Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary Deirdre O’Brien Senior Vice President, Retail Jeff Williams Chief Operating Officer For 2023, we reported net sales of $383.3 billion
and operating income results of $114.3 billion.  Each of our named executive officers also received a 2023 cash incentive award
based on the achievement of annual net sales and operating income performance goals and progress made in furtherance of
Apple’s values and key community initiatives. Achievement against the net sales and operating income performance goals resulted in a payout opportunity of 166.1%.The
People and Compensation Committee also recognized the significant results delivered and progress made in 2023 in furtherance of our
values and key community initiatives and applied a 7.5% modifier to the payout opportunity for a final Cash Incentive Plan payout of
178.6% of target for each of our named executive officers. Say on Pay Advisory Vote Results Following the 2022 Annual Meeting, Apple
engaged with a significant number of our largest shareholders to discuss their perspectives with respect to our executive
compensation program and CEO pay. The People and Compensation Committee balanced shareholder feedback, Apple’s
exceptional performance, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received and
made significant changes that are reflected in the amount and structure of Mr. Cook’s 2023 compensation. 89% of votes
cast on the Say on Pay advisory proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of our executive compensation program. We
believe the 2023 Say on Pay advisory vote reflects the expanded shareholder engagement efforts, and the positive shareholder
response to the overall structure of our executive compensation program and the changes to Mr. Cook’s 2023 total target
compensation. Mr. Cook’s 2023 total target compensation is further described in “CEO Compensation,”
below. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 47 Executive Compensation Policies and Practices We are committed to sound executive
compensation policies and practices, as highlighted in the following table. Prohibition on hedging, pledging, and short sales We prohibit short sales, transactions in derivatives, hedging, and pledging of Apple securities by our named executive officers. Stock ownership guidelines We have robust stock ownership guidelines for our named executive officers, including a ten times annual base salary requirement for our CEO. Compensation recoupment We have recoupment provisions that comply with the new SEC rules and Nasdaq Listing Standards for our Section 16 officers for the recovery of any erroneously awarded performance-based incentive compensation.  We also maintain a discretionary recoupment policy applicable to our named executive officers and our broader executive team that allows for recovery of annual cash incentives, equity awards, or other amounts that may be paid with respect to awards in certain events, including for certain acts of misconduct by our named executive officers. No repricing We do not allow repricing of stock options without shareholder approval. No tax gross-ups on perquisites We do not provide tax gross-ups for the limited types of perquisites provided to our named executive officers. For security and efficiency purposes, Mr. Cook is required by the Board to use private aircraft for all business and personal travel and is provided personal security services. No change of control payments We do not provide change of control payments or gross-ups of related excise taxes. Vesting requirements for dividend equivalents Dividend equivalents will not be paid unless the vesting and performance conditions for the underlying equity award are met. At-will employment We employ our named executive officers at-will; our named executive officers do not have employment contracts. No pension or other supplemental benefits We do not provide pension, supplemental executive health or insurance benefits. Annual compensation risk assessment The People and Compensation Committee oversees an annual risk assessment of our compensation program. Independent compensation consultant The People and Compensation Committee directly retains an independent compensation consultant that performs no services for Apple other than services for the People and Compensation Committee. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 48 Guiding Compensation Principles Our executive compensation program is designed to motivate
and reward outstanding performance, retain strong leadership, and promote teamwork in a straightforward and effective way. Our clear guiding
principles and sound compensation policies and practices align the pay of our named executive officers with Company performance, taking
into consideration the size, scope, and success of Apple’s business. Team-Based Approach We apply a unique team-based approach to the compensation
of our named executive officers to emphasize their shared responsibility for Apple’s overall success. This approach recognizes the
exceptional experience, leadership, and value each of our named executive officers contributes to Apple’s leadership team, with
CEO compensation awarded at a higher level to reflect the additional scope and complexity of that role. Performance Expectations The vast majority of our executive pay is tied to performance
to ensure alignment with the long-term interests of shareholders. We establish clear, quantitative financial goals and values-driven performance
expectations for our named executive officers each year that focus on Apple’s overall success. Emphasis on Long-Term Equity Awards We emphasize long-term
performance, retention, and alignment between the interests of our named executive officers and those of our shareholders by
significantly weighting our named executive officers’ compensation towards long-term equity awards. Performance-based
RSUs reward long-term out-performance relative to other companies. Time-based RSUs are also an important component of
long-term equity awards because they promote stability and retention of an exceptional leadership team. Executive Compensation Decision-Making Process Setting appropriate compensation for our named executive
officers is a core responsibility of the People and Compensation Committee. The People and Compensation Committee consists entirely
of independent directors who review and approve the compensation of Apple’s named executive officers each year.  It also administers
Apple’s employee equity compensation plans. The People and Compensation Committee may delegate its authority under its charter to
Apple’s officers or employees, or any of its individual members, except to the extent otherwise prohibited by applicable law, or
SEC or Nasdaq rules. The People and Compensation Committee’s authority to grant equity awards or to take any other action with respect
to equity awards (other than the performance of ministerial duties) may not be delegated to Apple’s management or others. The People and Compensation Committee
reviews Apple’s executive compensation program each year and considers a variety of factors in setting total target
compensation values and structure, including shareholder interests; the size, scope, and success of Apple; the scope of its
business; evolving compensation trends; and Apple’s financial goals. It also evaluates shareholder feedback, as
well as the views of its independent compensation consultant and management. However, the People and Compensation Committee
makes final decisions regarding the compensation granted to our named executive officers based on our guiding compensation
principles noted above and makes changes to our executive compensation program based on its own business judgment. People and Compensation Committee Priorities when Setting Executive Compensation ● Managing Apple for the long-term ● Aligning pay with performance ● Retaining exceptional, values-driven leaders ● Responding to shareholders’ interests and feedback ● Maintaining Apple’s unique team-based approach Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 49 The Role of the Compensation Consultant The People and Compensation Committee selects and retains
the services of its own independent compensation consultant and annually reviews the consultant’s performance. As part of the review process,
the People and Compensation Committee considers the independence of the consultant in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules. During 2023, the People and Compensation Committee’s
independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance, provided no services to Apple other than services for the People and Compensation
Committee, and worked with Apple’s management, as directed by the People and Compensation Committee, only on matters for which the
People and Compensation Committee is responsible. At the People and Compensation Committee’s request, Pay Governance regularly attends
the People and Compensation Committee meetings. Pay Governance also communicates with the members of the People and Compensation Committee
outside committee meetings regarding matters related to the People and Compensation Committee’s responsibilities. In 2023, the People and Compensation Committee generally
sought input from Pay Governance on a range of external market factors related to Apple’s compensation programs; CEO pay; recoupment
policy amendments; shareholder engagement; environmental, social, and governance performance metrics; people policies; overall compensation
program design; evolving compensation trends; appropriate market reference points; and market compensation data. Pay Governance also provided
input regarding the amount and form of compensation for our CEO and other named executive officers. The Role of Shareholders Shareholders are provided the
opportunity to cast an annual Say on Pay advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. Shareholder
feedback is an important part of the compensation-setting process, and Apple has a long history of proactively engaging with
shareholders throughout the year to learn their perspectives on significant issues, including company performance and
strategy, executive compensation, and environmental, social, and corporate governance matters. The People and Compensation
Committee values the views of our shareholders as expressed through annual Say on Pay advisory votes, as well as the feedback
received through our regular shareholder outreach and engagement process. Following the 2022 Annual Meeting, Apple engaged
with a significant number of our largest shareholders to discuss their perspectives with respect to our executive
compensation program and CEO pay. What We Heard ● Request for more disclosure on Mr. Cook’s compensation and
    the compensation setting process. Actions Taken in Response ● Detail was provided in the 2023 Proxy Statement and in this
    CD&A about Mr. Cook’s compensation and the compensation setting process. ● Concern over the amount of Mr. Cook’s total target compensation
    and preference for reduced equity award values for future grants if equity awards will be granted annually. ● Mr. Cook’s 2023 target total compensation is $49 million, a
    reduction of over 40% from his 2022 target total compensation. The People and Compensation Committee also intends to position Mr. Cook’s
    annual target compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles relative to our primary peer group for future years. ● Preference for a higher percentage of Mr. Cook’s equity award
    to be performance-based. ● The portion of performance-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook was
    increased from 50% to 75% of his 2023 target equity award and the portion of his performance-based RSUs will be at least 75% for future
    years. ● Preference for pro rata vesting of equity awards upon a termination
    of employment due to retirement. ● The 2023 time-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook provide for pro-rata vesting if he retires and the People and Compensation Committee intends to maintain this structure for future years. 89% of votes cast on the Say on Pay advisory
proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of our named executive compensation program. The People and Compensation Committee
has and will continue to gather and consider shareholder feedback and the results of Say on Pay votes when setting compensation in
the future. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 50 Role of Peer Groups The People and Compensation Committee reviews and
approves the composition of a primary and a secondary peer group each year to serve as market reference points for compensation
comparison purposes, to inform its decision-making process, and to set total target compensation
levels that it believes are competitive and commensurate with Apple’s relative size, scope, and success. In connection with changes made to
Mr. Cook’s 2023 total target compensation, the People and Compensation Committee stated its intention to set Mr.
Cook’s total target compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles relative to the CEO pay of our primary peer
group companies for future years. To make this determination, the People and Compensation Committee will review with its
independent compensation consultant the target annual total compensation opportunity provided to the CEOs in Apple’s
primary peer group using the then available public filings for each of the companies. Apple remains significantly larger than
most other companies and the People and Compensation Committee does not otherwise set compensation components for its named
executive officers to meet specific benchmarks as compared to peer companies. Revenue shown is based on the trailing 12 months revenue
for Apple and each of our primary peers ending closest to our 2023 fiscal year-end. Market capitalization for our primary peers is the
amount reported by Bloomberg L.P. as of September 29, 2023, the last trading day of 2023. Our primary peer group consists of large
U.S.-based, stand-alone, publicly traded companies in the technology, media, and internet services industries that, in the
People and Compensation Committee’s view, compete with Apple for talent. The threshold revenue and market
capitalization requirements for a company to be considered for the primary peer group for 2023 were $20 billion and $100
billion, respectively at the time the 2023 peer group was set. Based on the above criteria, the People and Compensation
Committee removed Charter Communications and IBM and added Mastercard Incorporated, Tesla, Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery,
Inc. to the primary peer group for 2023. The 2023 primary group includes Alphabet, Amazon, AT&T, Cisco, Comcast, Disney,
Intel, Mastercard, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Oracle, Qualcomm, Salesforce, Tesla, Verizon, Visa, and Warner Bros.
Discovery. A secondary peer group of companies that have
iconic brands or are industry or category leaders, rely on significant research and development, and innovation for growth, and
require highly-skilled employees has been developed as an additional reference set, primarily to compare pay practices. The 2023
secondary peer group includes 3M, AbbVie, The Coca-Cola Company, Johnson & Johnson, Nike, PepsiCo,
Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Starbucks, and UnitedHealth Group. As shown in the chart above, Apple remains
considerably larger than the typical company in the primary peer group.  Apple has approximately four times the revenue and
approximately twelve times the market capitalization of the median peer companies in its primary peer group. Apple’s size and scope
with respect to its primary peer companies in terms of revenue and market capitalization supports our CEO’s total target
compensation positioning between the 80th to 90th percentile of CEO total target compensation at these companies. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 51 The Role of the Chief Executive Officer At the People and Compensation Committee’s request, Mr. Cook
provides input regarding the performance and compensation of the other named executive officers. The People and Compensation Committee
considers Mr. Cook’s evaluation and his direct knowledge of each named executive officer’s performance and contributions when
setting compensation. Mr. Cook is not present during People and Compensation Committee voting or deliberations regarding his own compensation. Components of Named Executive Officer Compensation The target total compensation of our named executive
officers has three basic components: annual base salary, annual cash incentive, and long-term equity awards. Annual Base Salary Base salary is a customary, fixed element of compensation
intended to attract and retain executives. When setting the annual base salaries of our named executive officers, the People and Compensation
Committee considers market data provided by its independent compensation consultant, and Apple’s financial performance and size
relative to peer companies. The annual base salaries for our named executive officers did not change for 2023. Annual Cash Incentive Our annual cash incentive program is a performance-based, at-risk component of our named executive officers’ compensation. Cash incentive awards are granted under the Apple Inc.
Executive Cash Incentive Plan (the “Cash Incentive Plan”). Variable payouts are designed to motivate our named executive
officers to deliver strong annual financial results, while advancing Apple values and key community initiatives. The structure and
payout opportunities under the Cash Incentive Plan did not change for 2023. Additional details regarding the Cash Incentive Plan for
2023 can be found below in the section entitled “Cash Incentive Plan- 2023 Financial Performance Measures and Payout
Opportunities.” Long-Term Equity Awards We pay for performance and manage Apple for the long-term. Consistent with this approach and our guiding compensation principles, the vast majority of our named executive officers’
annual compensation is granted in the form of long-term equity incentives that emphasize long-term shareholder value creation and the
retention of a strong executive leadership team through a mix of performance-based and time-based RSU awards. Additional details regarding
these awards and the performance-based RSUs that vested in 2023 can be found below in the section entitled “2023 Long-Term Equity
Awards and Results.” Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 52 Summary of CEO Compensation The People and Compensation
Committee evaluates our executive compensation program and the total target value of Mr. Cook’s compensation prior to
the start of each fiscal year. In determining the appropriate amount of each compensation component for 2023, the People
and Compensation Committee considered numerous factors with the Board and its independent compensation consultant, including
Mr. Cook’s outstanding leadership, the immense scope and complexity of his role as Apple’s CEO, the
Board’s confidence in his long-term strategic decisions, the Company’s financial results delivered during 2022,
and shareholder feedback. Balancing this feedback, Apple’s exceptional performance, a desire to continue to create
meaningful performance and retention incentives, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of
the feedback received, the People and Compensation Committee reduced his 2023 target equity award value while increasing the
portion of performance-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook from 50% to 75%. Given Apple’s significantly larger size and
scope, as compared to its primary peer companies, as well as Mr. Cook’s history of delivering exceptional results, the
People and Compensation Committee also intends to position his future total target compensation, commensurate with these
factors, between the 80th and 90th percentiles of CEO total target compensation in our primary peer group. Tim
                                            Cook Chief Executive Officer Role: 12 years Apple Tenure: 25 years 2023
                                            Total Target Compensation: $49 million Base Salary: $3 million Mr. Cook’s base salary has remained the same since 2016 Cash Incentive Plan Opportunity: $6 million Mr. Cook’s
target Cash Incentive Plan opportunity for 2023 remained at 200% of his base salary Target Equity Award Value: $40 million Award Mix: 75/25 Mr. Cook was granted an equity award with 75% of the
equity award subject to performance-based vesting and 25% of the equity award subject to time-based vesting CEO Equity Awards Equity awards granted to Mr. Cook are
intended to create meaningful equity incentives aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. The People and
Compensation Committee recognizes the growth and success Mr. Cook has delivered to shareholders for more than a decade as
CEO, and the impact of his leadership is evident in the Company’s short-term and long-term success. The amount and
structure of Mr. Cook’s equity awards are intended to align with our philosophy of managing Apple for the long term and
create incentives to drive continued success. Mr. Cook’s first RSU award as CEO in
2011 had a unique 10-year structure (the “2011 Award”). As the final vesting tranches of the 2011 Award
approached, the People and Compensation Committee evaluated Mr. Cook’s equity compensation structure in light of
the rapid growth and unparalleled success that Apple had achieved under Mr. Cook’s leadership. The People and
Compensation Committee also considered the strong compensation structure and practices that had developed for our other named
executive officers, and the differences that had developed between the structure of Mr. Cook’s long-term equity
incentives and the long-term equity incentives awarded to our other named executive officers annually since 2014. Taking
these factors into consideration, Mr. Cook was granted an equity award in 2021 for the first time since he was promoted to
CEO and a second award, identical in amount and structure, was granted for 2022. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 53 In 2023, Mr. Cook was granted an equity
award with a total target equity grant value of $40 million (“2023 Equity Award”), a reduction in value of almost
40% from his 2022 target equity grant value. The 2023 Equity Award was specifically designed to continue to align pay with
performance and shareholder interests and recognize Mr. Cook’s outstanding leadership.  It was further designed to
balance shareholder feedback, Apple’s exceptional performance, a desire to continue to create meaningful performance
and retention incentives, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received.
The People and Compensation Committee also changed the mix of the 2023 Equity Award to increase the performance-based portion
of the award from 50% to 75% and reduce the time-based portion of the award from 50% to 25%.  The portion of his
performance-based RSUs will also be at least 75% for future years. The People and Compensation Committee believes these
changes are responsive to shareholder feedback and meet the other objectives it considered for Mr. Cook’s compensation,
as noted above. Alignment with Shareholder Value Creation The majority of Mr.
Cook’s compensation has been delivered through long-term equity awards since his promotion to CEO in 2011. The equity
awards he has received align with Apple’s growth and success and the tremendous value delivered to our shareholders
under his leadership. As of the end of 2023, Apple’s Relative TSR increased approximately 1,402% during Mr.
Cook’s tenure as CEO, significantly outpacing the S&P 500 which increased approximately 360% over the same time
period. Apple’s market capitalization also grew by more than $2 trillion during Mr. Cook’s tenure as
CEO. 2024 CEO Total Target Compensation When evaluating our executive compensation program and
the total target value of Mr. Cook’s compensation for 2024, the People and Compensation Committee considered Mr. Cook’s continued
exceptional performance as CEO, the Company’s strong financial performance in an uneven macroeconomic environment, and shareholder
feedback. Upon review of the relevant benchmark data with its independent compensation consultant the People and Compensation Committee
increased the target value of Mr. Cook’s equity award for 2024 to $50 million, which, along with his base salary and target Cash Incentive
Plan award, positions his 2024 total target compensation within the 80th to 90th percentile of CEO pay at the companies in our primary
peer group. The People and Compensation Committee maintained the same equity award structure and weightings with 75% of the equity award
subject to performance-based vesting and 25% of the equity award subject to time-based vesting.  No changes were made to the
amount of Mr. Cook’s base salary or the 2024 target payout opportunity under the Cash Incentive Plan. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 54 Summary of Other Named Executive Officer Compensation The total target compensation of our four other named
executive officers similarly reflects the three basic components of our executive compensation program in a straightforward and effective
way. Taking into account individual and company
performance, as well as shareholder feedback which has consistently confirmed support for the amount and structure of
our other named executive officers’ compensation, the People and Compensation Committee decided to maintain the same
level of base salary, Cash Incentive Plan opportunity, and equity award value for each of our named executive officers for
2023. The People and Compensation Committee determined that the target compensation of our named executive officers remains
competitive and continues to be commensurate with Apple’s performance and significantly larger size and scope compared
to other companies, and is appropriately aligned with our guiding principles and the scope of each named executive
officer’s role. Luca Maestri SVP, Chief Financial Officer Role: 9 years Apple Tenure: 10 years 2023 Total Target Compensation: $23 million Base Salary: $1 million The annual base salaries for our named executive officers did not change
    for 2023. Cash Incentive Plan Opportunity: $2 million Our named executive officers’ target Cash Incentive Plan opportunity
    for 2023 remained unchanged at 200% of their base salary. Target Equity Award Value: $20 million Award Mix: 50/50 Our named executive officers were granted a balanced equity award, with
    50% of the equity award subject to performance-based vesting and 50% subject to time-based vesting, to encourage long-term performance,
    retention, and alignment with shareholders’ interests. Kate Adams SVP, General Counsel and Secretary Role: 6 years Apple Tenure: 6 years Deirdre O’Brien SVP, Retail Role: 4 years Apple Tenure: 35 years Jeff Williams Chief Operating Officer Role: 8 years Apple Tenure: 25 years Additional details regarding our named
executive officers’ 2023 compensation can be found below in the sections entitled “Cash Incentive Plan- 2023
Financial Performance Measures and Payout Opportunities” and “2023 Long-Term Equity Awards and
Results.” Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 55 Cash Incentive Plan - 2023 Financial
Performance Measures and Payout Opportunities Our Cash Incentive Plan awards are designed to motivate
and reward our named executive officers for delivering strong performance against annual financial goals and values-driven performance
expectations. As in prior years, the People and Compensation Committee chose net sales and operating income, calculated in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, as the financial performance measures for the 2023 Cash Incentive Plan awards. Net sales
and operating income continue to reflect commonly recognized key measures of overall company performance and profitability and are drivers
of shareholder value creation. Payouts for our named executive officers under the
Cash Incentive Plan are first determined quantitatively based on an equal weighting of the net sales and operating income
performance measures. The target payout opportunity for each of the net sales and operating income performance measures is 100% of
annual base salary for our named executive officers. Threshold performance results in a payout equal to 50% of target and maximum
performance results in a payout equal to 200% of target for each of the performance measures. If the threshold goal is not achieved
for a financial performance measure, there is no payout for that measure and the total payout opportunity for each financial
performance measure is capped at 200%. Payouts for our named executive officers are linearly interpolated for achievement between
goal levels. The People and Compensation Committee primarily considers
factors relevant to the current fiscal year when it sets the net sales and operating income goals for the annual Cash Incentive Plan awards
because each year presents a unique set of challenges and business conditions for our executives to navigate. Financial results from prior
years are used as a reference point, but the annual goals are set primarily to align pay with performance that reflects strong financial
results commensurate with the projected business and economic conditions for the current fiscal year. 2023 Financial Performance Goals and Results As part of its goal-setting process for
2023, the People and Compensation Committee considered the likelihood of a range of business scenarios that could impact net
sales and operating income results for the year taking into account several factors. These factors included anticipated
foreign currency headwinds, the ongoing uneven macroeconomic environment and the continuing effects of the prolonged
uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic including, country-specific policies and lockdowns. Accordingly, the People and
Compensation Committee determined that focusing on the underlying business performance was an appropriate method of
evaluating the 2023 performance goals. The Committee believed that attaining similar underlying performance to 2022’s
record-breaking net sales and operating income results would require a high level of performance given these factors, and set
the target goals at this level. For 2023, the Company’s total net
sales decreased 3%. However, the weakness in foreign exchange relative to the US dollar accounted for more than the entire
year-over-year decrease in total net sales. On an underlying basis, the company delivered strong performance in a challenging
environment driven by all-time high revenue records in emerging markets, and we achieved an all-time revenue record in
Services. The Company was also thoughtful and deliberate on spending while driving cost and gross margins improvements
throughout the year.  Overall, we reported net sales of $383.3 billion and operating income of $114.3 billion. These
achievements resulted in 153.1% and 179.1% target payout opportunities, respectively, for an aggregate payout opportunity of
166.1% prior to application of the modifier described below. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 56 Annual Assessment of Apple Values and Key Community Initiatives We believe that our business can and should
be a force for good. Achieving that takes innovation, collaboration, and a focus on serving others. It also means leading
with our values in the technology we make, the way we make it, and how we treat people and the planet we all share.
We’re always working to leave the world better than we found it, and to create powerful tools that empower others to do
the same.  To support these ambitions, the Cash Incentive Plan includes a modifier based on our named executive
officers’ efforts to further our values and key community initiatives. After the People and Compensation Committee
determines the preliminary payout opportunity based on our net sales and operating income performance measures, it may choose
to apply a modifier to the preliminary payout opportunity of up to 10%, upwards or downwards, or determine not to make any
adjustment at all. The Cash Incentive Plan award is subject to an overall cap on each of the named executive officers’
payout of 200% of the total target payout opportunity, regardless of the results of the People and Compensation
Committee’s values assessment. For 2023, the People and Compensation
Committee reviewed with management an extensive scorecard for each Apple value and key community initiative to inform its
overall values assessment. Each scorecard included a long-term vision, 2023 areas of focus, highlights, including qualitative
and quantitative data to measure progress, areas of opportunity, and management’s assessment of our overall progress to
advance each value and key community initiative. Based on its discussions with management and overall evaluation of the Apple
values scorecard presented for the year, the People and Compensation Committee recognized the significant progress achieved
as represented by the select highlights below, while also recognizing the areas of opportunity, and applied a modifier of
7.5% out of the maximum of 10%. Scorecard Focus and Select Highlights: Accessibility Focus : Ensuring our

executive officers, the People and Compensation Committee considers the size and performance of Apple relative to peer companies, and
the scope of our named executive officers’ roles. Each named executive officer other than Mr. Cook was granted a long-term equity
award on September 25, 2022 of 50% performance-based and 50% time-based RSUs. Mr. Cook was granted a long-term equity award on September
25, 2022 of 75% performance-based and 25% time-based RSUs. 2023 Time-Based RSUs Equity awards with time-based vesting align the interests
of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders by promoting the stability and retention of a high-performing executive
team over the longer term. Vesting schedules for time-based RSUs are generally longer than our peer companies. Time-based RSUs granted to our named
executive officers on September 25, 2022, will vest in three equal annual installments over approximately four and one-half
years, with the first installment vesting on April 1, 2025 (approximately two and one-half years following the grant date),
subject to the award agreements. The number of time-based RSUs granted to each named executive officer was determined by
dividing the target value of $10 million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair value for these
RSUs is reported in the “Summary Compensation Table—2023, 2022, and 2021.” 2023 Performance-Based RSUs The People and Compensation Committee continued to use
Relative TSR as the metric for performance-based RSUs with the S&P 500 as the comparative group because it continues to be an objective
and meaningful metric to evaluate our performance against the performance of other large companies and aligns the interests of our named
executive officers with the interests of our shareholders in creating long-term value. Performance-based RSUs are a
substantial, at-risk component of our named executive officers’ compensation tied to Apple’s long-term
performance. The number of performance-based RSUs that vest, if any, depends entirely on Relative TSR for the applicable
performance period. To earn the target number of performance-based RSUs, Apple must achieve above-median performance at the
55th percentile of the S&P 500. We measure Relative TSR for the applicable performance period based on the change in each
company’s stock price during the applicable performance period, taking into account any dividends paid during that
period, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. We use a 20-trading-day averaging period to determine the beginning
and ending stock price to calculate the TSR of Apple and each company in the S&P 500. This averaging period mitigates the
impact on the long-term Relative TSR results of one-day or short-term stock price fluctuations at the beginning or end of the
performance period. For each company, the change in stock price from the beginning to the end of the performance period is
divided by the beginning stock price to determine TSR. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 59 The performance-based RSUs granted
on September 25, 2022, have a three-fiscal-year performance period from the beginning of 2023 through the end of 2025.
Subject to the terms of the award agreements, between zero and 200% of the target number of performance-based RSUs will vest
on October 1, 2025, depending on Apple’s Relative TSR percentile ranking for the performance period, as follows: Relative TSR Percentile v. S&P 500 Companies Performance-Based RSUs Vesting as a Percentage of Target 85th Percentile or above 200% 55th Percentile 100% 25th Percentile 25% Below 25th 0% If Apple’s TSR for the performance
period is negative, the number of performance-based RSUs that vest will be capped at 100% of the target regardless of our
percentile ranking. If Apple’s Relative TSR percentile ranking is above the 25th percentile and between the other
levels shown in the table above, the portion of the performance-based RSUs that vest will be linearly interpolated between
the two nearest vesting percentages. The target number of performance-based RSUs granted
to Mr. Cook was determined by dividing the target value of $30 million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The target number
of performance-based RSUs granted to Ms. Adams, Mr. Maestri, Ms. O’Brien, and Mr. Williams was determined by dividing
the target value of $10 million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair values of these RSUs are reported
in the “Summary Compensation Table—2023, 2022, and 2021.” Dividend Equivalents All equity awards granted to our employees in 2023 have
dividend equivalent rights. The dividend equivalents will only pay out if the time-based vesting and performance-based vesting conditions
have been met for the underlying RSUs. Performance-Based RSU 2023 Results On October 1, 2022, Ms. Adams, Mr. Maestri,
Ms. O’Brien and Mr. Williams each vested in performance-based RSUs that were granted on September 29, 2019. Between
zero and 200% of the target number of these performance-based RSUs were scheduled to vest based on Apple’s Relative TSR
percentile ranking for the applicable performance period, with a maximum 200% vesting for performance at or above the 85th
percentile. Mr. Cook did not have a performance-based RSU scheduled to vest in 2023. For the three-year performance period from
September 29, 2019 through September 24, 2022, Ms. Adams, Mr. Maestri, and Mr. Williams each vested in
365,600 performance-based RSUs, representing 200% of the target number of performance-based RSUs.

also eligible to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, health and welfare programs, 401(k) plan, tenure-based
service awards, matching gifts, vacation cash-out, product discount, and other compensation and benefit programs on the same
basis as other employees. Items or services provided to our named executive officers that may be considered perquisites are
limited, as discussed below and reported in “Summary Compensation Table—2023, 2022, and 2021.” Deferred Compensation Plan Our named executive officers are eligible to defer a
portion of their base salary and ther annual Cash Incentive Plan payout opportunity under the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan. Other Personal Benefits We provide risk-based,
business-related, and personal security services for our employees, including our named executive officers, as determined to
be appropriate by our security team. We consider the security measures provided to our named executive officers to be
reasonable and necessary expenses for the benefit of Apple and not a personal benefit. In the interests of security and
efficiency based on our global profile and the highly visible nature of Mr. Cook’s role as CEO, the Board also requires
that Mr. Cook use private aircraft for all business and personal travel. Mr. Cook recognizes imputed taxable income and is
not provided a tax reimbursement for personal use of private aircraft. On occasion, our named executive officers, and
personal guests, may attend company-sponsored or business-related entertainment events. Although their attendance serves a
business purpose, it may not be directly related to their role and responsibilities. As a result, our named executive
officers may recognize imputed taxable income related to their attendance at such events depending on their respective roles
and responsibilities and we do not provide an associated tax reimbursement or gross-up. In accordance with SEC disclosure
rules, the aggregate incremental costs associated with these activities is reported in the “Summary Compensation
Table—2023, 2022, and 2021.” Compensation Upon Termination of Employment Our named executive officers do not have employment
contracts or guaranteed cash severance arrangements and are not entitled to acceleration of their equity awards or any other payments
upon a change in control. The time-based RSU award agreements for all
our employees, including Mr. Cook, provide for full accelerated vesting upon a termination due to death. The time-based RSU
agreements for all our employees, other than Mr. Cook, provide for pro-rata accelerated vesting upon a termination due to
disability. The performance-based RSU award agreements for our named executive officers, other than Mr. Cook, provide for
pro-rata accelerated vesting upon a termination due to death or disability. The time and performance-based RSU
agreements for Mr. Cook provide for full vesting upon a termination due to disability with settlement occurring on the
originally scheduled vesting dates. The People and Compensation Committee also approved a retirement vesting provision in Mr.
Cook’s outstanding equity awards to recognize the unique impact of his leadership decisions on the long-term growth and
success of Apple. Retirement is defined as a termination of employment after reaching at least 60 years of age and completing
at least 10 years of service with Apple. Mr. Cook has met these requirements. The People and Compensation Committee
considered shareholder feedback provided in recent engagements that the primary purpose of time-based RSUs should be
retention. Thus, while treatment in the event of death or disability remained unchanged, Mr. Cook’s 2023
time-based RSUs were structured to vest on a pro rata basis, based on the dates of employment, in the event of his
termination due to retirement on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Unless otherwise determined by the People
and Compensation Committee, Mr. Cook’s outstanding performance-based RSU agreements provide for a continued right to
receive the full number of earned shares underlying the performance-based RSUs on the original vesting dates upon a
termination due to death, disability, or termination of employment due to retirement that occurs on or after the first
anniversary of the grant date. If Mr. Cook retires on or after the first anniversary of the grant date, the shares underlying
his RSU awards will be released on the original vesting date, subject to the attainment of the performance goals for the
performance-based RSUs. The delivery of the vested shares underlying Mr. Cook’s equity awards and any dividend
equivalents that have accrued on such awards are not accelerated upon retirement. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 61 Governance and Other Considerations Recoupment of Compensation The terms of all outstanding RSU awards held by our
named executive officers in 2023 allow us to recoup any shares or other amount that may be paid in respect of RSUs in the event the named
executive officer engages in certain acts of misconduct. The compensation recoupment policy also applies to the awards and payout opportunities
granted under the Cash Incentive Plan to our executive officers. Apple may recover compensation in the event a named executive officer
commits a felony while employed by Apple or, while employed by Apple or at any time thereafter, a named executive officer engages in a
breach of confidentiality; materially breaches any agreement with Apple; commits an act of theft, embezzlement or fraud; or if Apple is
required to prepare an accounting restatement as a result of the named executive officer’s misconduct. Apple also adopted additional
recoupment provisions in 2024 in accordance with the SEC rules and Nasdaq Listing Standards effective on October 2, 2023, which mandate
the recovery of certain erroneously paid performance-based incentive compensation that may be received by our Section 16 officers on or
after October 2, 2023, if Apple has a qualifying financial restatement during the three completed fiscal years immediately prior to the
fiscal year in which a financial restatement determination is made, subject to limited exceptions. Prohibition on Hedging, Pledging, and Short Sales We prohibit short sales, hedging,
and transactions in derivatives of Apple securities for all Apple personnel, including directors, officers, employees,
independent contractors, and consultants. In addition, we prohibit pledging of Apple stock as collateral by directors and
executive officers of Apple. We allow for certain portfolio diversification transactions, such as investments in exchange
funds. Stock Ownership Guidelines Under our stock ownership guidelines, Mr.
Cook is expected to own shares of Apple stock that have a value equal to 10 times his annual base salary. All other executive
officers are expected to own shares that have a value equal to three times their annual base salary within five years of the
officer first becoming subject to the guidelines. Shares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with or
separately by the individual’s spouse, or held in trust for the benefit of the individual, the individual’s
spouse, or the individual’s children. Each executive officer currently holds shares in excess of these guidelines. Risk Considerations In establishing and reviewing Apple’s
executive compensation program, the People and Compensation Committee considers whether the program encourages unnecessary or
excessive risk-taking and has concluded that it does not. See the section entitled “Corporate Governance–Board
Oversight” above for an additional discussion of risk considerations. People and Compensation Committee Report The People and Compensation Committee has reviewed and
discussed with management the disclosures contained in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis.” Based on this review and
discussion, the People and Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the section entitled “Compensation Discussion and
Analysis” be included in this Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting.

    on the closing price of Apple’s common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value for performance-based RSUs is
    calculated using a Monte-Carlo model for each award on the date of grant, as determined under FASB ASC 718 based on the probable
    outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. The grant date fair value for each award may differ based on the applicable
    data, assumptions, and estimates used in the model. See footnote 1 to the table entitled “Grants of Plan-Based Awards—2023.” (2) As described under “Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis,”
    the named executive officers’ Cash Incentive Plan awards are based on the performance of Apple relative to predetermined financial
    goals for the year and the performance of the individual named executive officer. The threshold, target, and maximum payout amounts
    for each named executive officer’s Cash Incentive Plan payout opportunity for 2023 are shown in the table entitled “Grants
    of Plan-Based Awards—2023.” In 2023, Apple’s performance exceeded the target performance goals for both net sales
    and operating income, resulting in a preliminary payout of 166.1% of the total target payout opportunity for each named executive
    officer. Upon review and discussion with management of the significant actions taken and progress achieved across each of our values
    and key community initiatives during 2023, the People and Compensation Committee modified the preliminary payout opportunities by
    7.5% and awarded Cash Incentive Plan payouts equal to 178.6% of the target payout opportunity for each of our named executive officers.

    the incremental cost to Apple for Mr. Cook’s personal use of private aircraft based on hourly flight charges and other variable
    costs incurred by Apple for such use, including variable fuel charges, departure fees, and landing fees; and (vi) the incremental
    cost to Apple for a tenure-based service award for Mr. Cook. For security and efficiency reasons, the Board requires Mr. Cook to

    column of the “Summary Compensation Table—2023, 2022, and 2021,” under 2022, the year it was earned. (2) The balance reflects $7,303,650 that was reported as compensation in the “Summary Compensation
    Table” in prior years. Description of Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Our named executive officers and Non-Employee Directors are eligible to participate
in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred Compensation Plan participants may
elect to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and commissions and up to 90% of their eligible cash bonus, or up to
100% of their annual cash retainer in the case of Non-Employee Directors, by timely completing a deferral election form.
Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan, as adjusted for applicable earnings gains and losses and fees, are
credited to an account in the participant’s name and remain fully vested at all times. Participants may select at any
time from a diversified menu of notional investment options that generally mirror the investment options of Apple’s
401(k) plan, and the value of their Deferred Compensation Plan account balance may increase or decrease based on the
performance of their selected investment options. In 2023, annual returns on the investment options available for the
Deferred Compensation Plan generally ranged from 0.75% to 29.28%. Deferred Compensation Plan participants may elect to
receive distributions of their deferred amounts either upon separation from service or as of a specified in-service distribution date.
Distributions will be made in a lump sum payment unless the participant elects installment payments between two and 10 years. A Deferred
Compensation Plan participant also may request to receive a hardship distribution on account of an eligible unforeseeable emergency. If
a Deferred Compensation Plan participant dies before receiving a complete distribution of their account, the remaining account will be
paid to their beneficiaries in a lump sum by December 31 of the year following the participant’s death. Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control We do not have any cash severance arrangements with
our named executive officers, and none of our named executive officers’ equity awards outstanding as of 2023 fiscal year-end provide
for acceleration or a right to receive shares in connection with a change of control, or termination of employment for reasons other than
death, disability, or for Mr. Cook, retirement. Retirement is defined as a termination of employment after reaching at least 60 years
of age and at least 10 years of service with Apple. Equity Award Treatment Upon Termination of Employment CEO Awards Subject to the terms of the award
agreements, Mr. Cook’s time-based RSUs provide for accelerated vesting in full upon disability or death. Mr.
Cook’s 2021 and 2022 time-based RSUs provide for a continued right to receive the full number of unvested shares
underlying the time-based RSUs upon retirement that occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Mr.
Cook’s 2023 time-based RSUs provide for a continued right to receive a pro rata number of unvested shares underlying
the time-based RSUs upon retirement that occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. The pro rata vesting is
determined based on Mr. Cook’s period of employment during the vesting period. The delivery of the vested
shares underlying Mr. Cook’s time-based RSUs and any dividend equivalents that have accrued on such RSUs are not
accelerated upon disability or retirement and will continue to be delivered on the originally scheduled vesting dates. If
Mr. Cook terminates employment due to retirement before the first anniversary of the grant date of any time-based award, he
will not have a right to any unvested time-based RSUs. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 69 Mr. Cook’s outstanding
performance-based RSUs provide for a continued right to receive shares that are earned based upon full or partial attainment
of the award’s performance conditions upon a termination of employment due to death, disability, or retirement, if
retirement occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. If Mr. Cook terminates employment due to retirement
before the first anniversary of the grant date, he will not have a right to any of the earned but unvested performance-based
RSUs. Other Named-Executive Officer Awards The time-based RSUs held by our other named executive
officers, subject to the terms of the award agreements, provide for partial accelerated vesting of the RSUs scheduled to vest on the next
applicable vesting date following a termination of employment due to disability, and for full accelerated vesting upon death. Performance-based RSUs provide for a partial waiver of the service vesting condition upon the death or disability of the award recipient, with the
number of shares that vest determined at the end of the performance period, based on actual performance results and prorated based on
the recipient’s dates of employment during the performance period. Estimated total value of hypothetical equity acceleration The following table shows the estimated
amounts that the named executive officers would have become entitled to under the terms of all equity awards outstanding as

    on the date of retirement eligibility. As a result, 100% of the time-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook in 2021 and 2022 RSUs
    were     considered     “vested”. A pro rata portion of Mr. Cook’s 2023 time-based RSUs are considered
    “vested” consistent with the     retirement provisions of that award. No other NEOs, other than Mr. Cook, have
    retirement provisions in their equity awards. The fair     values of the RSUs included in the compensation actually paid to
    our CEO and the average compensation actually paid to our other     NEOs are calculated at the required measurement
    dates, consistent with the approach used to value the awards at the grant date as     described above in footnote 1 to the
    “Summary Compensation Table     – 2023, 2022, and 2021” and footnote 1 to the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards     – 2023” table,
    respectively. Any changes to the time-based RSU and performance-based RSU grant date fair values (for 2023 grants)     and
    from prior year-end (for 2021 and 2022 grants) are based on an updated stock price valuation on the measurement dates and
    for     the performance-based RSUs, including updated input variables for the Monte-Carlo model to estimate the probability
    of satisfying     the performance objectives established for the respective award.

    NEOs for each corresponding year in the “Total” column of the “Summary Compensation Table     – 2023, 2022, and 2021” as set forth on page 62 of this
    proxy statement. For each of 2021, 2022 and 2023, the other NEOs were Luca Maestri , Kate Adams , Deirdre O’Brien , and Jeff Williams . (4) Apple’s TSR in column (f) was determined based on the value of an initial fixed investment
    of $100, as of September 26, 2020, including the reinvestment of any dividends. (5) The peer groups used to calculate Peer Group TSR in column (g) are our primary peer group as disclosed
    in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, our 2023 Proxy Statement for 2022 and our 2022 Proxy
    Statement for 2021. TSR is based on the value of an initial fixed investment of $100 at the start of 2021 and is weighted for the
    market capitalization of each peer company in each applicable year. (6) In addition to Relative TSR and Operating Income, Net Sales in column (i) represents the most important
    financial performance measure used to link Compensation Actually Paid to company performance (the “Company Selected Measure”
    as defined in the Pay Versus Performance rules). Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and our Total Shareholder
Return Long-term equity incentives represent a vast majority
of our NEOs’ total target compensation and our stock price performance or TSR is the key driver of Compensation Actually Paid. We also
use Relative TSR as the key performance measure for our performance-based RSUs.  Over the three-year period covered in this disclosure,
Apple’s TSR on an absolute basis was high, 55.24%, and outperformed the TSR of our primary peer group by 16.88%.  Apple’s
Relative TSR measured against the members of the S&P 500 Index (the peer group for performance-based RSUs) was also strong, resulting
in above-target payouts for the performance-based RSUs with applicable performance periods ending in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Further, the
TSR relative to the currently outstanding performance-based RSUs (granted in 2022 and 2023) continues to trend towards above-target payouts
due to strong TSR relative to the members of the S&P 500.  This shows how Compensation Actually Paid to our NEOs and TSR are
tightly linked. The 2021 Compensation Actually Paid values
for the CEO and NEOs are higher than the Summary Compensation Table totals in 2021, and higher than the Compensation Actually
Paid values in 2022 and 2023 because Apple’s significant and outstanding stock price increase in the years immediately
preceding 2021 resulted in our NEOs holding a larger value of unvested equity awards as of the start of 2021. Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Income Net Income is generally a key indicator of company profitability
and for Apple can contribute to changes in our stock price, which in turn drives Compensation Actually Paid.  We do not use Net Income
as a financial measure in our executive compensation program but Operating Income from which Net Income is derived. Operating Income and
Net Sales are the two financial performance measures for our Cash Incentive Plan. Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Sales Net Sales is one of the two financial measures, the
People and Compensation Committee has set for our Cash Incentive Plan, and therefore along with Operating Income is the next most important
financial metric in determining Compensation Actually Paid behind Relative TSR. Strong performance in Net Sales and Operating Income led
to above target bonus payouts in 2021, 2022, and 2023 which in turn increased Compensation Actually Paid. Tabular List of Apple’s most important metrics that link Compensation
Actually Paid to the Mr. Cook and other NEOs For 2023, the following list represented the most important
financial performance measures used by Apple to link Compensation Actually Paid with our financial performance: Net Sales Operating Income Relative TSR Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 72 CEO Pay Ratio—2023 We offer a wide range of benefits to our global employee
population, and we are committed to paying our employees competitively and equitably based on their role. For 2023, we used the same median employee that was
identified in 2022 since there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation that we reasonably believe would
result in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure. We determined our median compensated employee in 2022
by using base salary, bonuses, commissions, and grant date fair value of equity awards granted to employees in 2022 as our consistently
applied compensation measure. We applied this measure to our global employee population as of September 24, 2022, the last day of our
2022 fiscal year, and annualized base salaries for permanent full-time and part-time employees that did not work the full year. We calculated the median compensated
employee’s 2023 annual total compensation using the same methodology that is used to calculate our CEO’s annual
total compensation in the table entitled “Summary Compensation Table–2023, 2022, and 2021.” The 2023 annual
total compensation of our CEO was $63,209,845, the 2023 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was
$94,118, and the ratio of these amounts is 672 to 1. Thus, this pay ratio reflects a reasonable estimate consistent with SEC
rules based on the methodology we described above. Because SEC rules for identifying a median compensated employee allow
companies to apply certain exclusions, include estimates, and adopt different methodologies that reflect their employee
population and compensation practices, the ratio above may not be comparable to the CEO pay ratio reported by other
companies. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 73 Management Proposals Proposal

Firm The Audit Committee has re-appointed Ernst
& Young LLP as Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm and as auditors of Apple’s
consolidated financial statements for 2024. The Audit Committee reviews the performance of the independent registered public
accounting firm annually. In making the determination to re-appoint Ernst & Young for 2024, the Audit Committee
considered, among other factors, the independence and performance of Ernst & Young, and the quality and candor of Ernst
& Young’s communications with the Audit Committee and management. Ernst & Young has served as
Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm since 2009. At the Annual Meeting, our shareholders are being asked to ratify
the appointment of Ernst & Young as Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2024. Although ratification
of the Audit Committee’s appointment of Ernst & Young is not required, we value the opinions of our shareholders and
believe that shareholder ratification of the appointment is a good corporate governance practice. In the event of a negative vote
on this proposal, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. Even if this appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee
may, in its discretion, appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit
Committee determines that it would be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. Representatives of Ernst & Young
are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will
be available to respond to questions. Fees Paid to Auditors The following table shows the fees billed by Apple’s independent

financial statements. (3) Tax fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance and preparation relating to tax returns and
tax audits, as well as for tax consulting and planning services. Tax fees in 2023 include $1.5 million for tax compliance
projects and $2.3 million for tax advisory projects. Tax fees in 2022 include $1.1 million for tax compliance projects

Performed by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Apple maintains an auditor independence policy that, among other things,
prohibits Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm from performing non-financial consulting services for Apple,
such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This policy mandates that the Audit Committee approve in
advance the audit and permissible non-audit services expected to be performed each year by the independent registered public accounting
firm and the related budget, and that the Audit Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. This policy
also mandates that Apple may not enter into engagements with Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm for other
permissible non-audit services without the express pre-approval of the Audit Committee. In accordance with this policy, the Audit
Committee pre-approved all services performed by Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm in 2023. The Board recommends a vote FOR Proposal No. 2 Vote Required Approval of Proposal No. 2 requires the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 77 Proposal No. 3 Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange
Act and the related rules of the SEC, our shareholders have the opportunity to cast an annual advisory vote to approve the compensation
of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the SEC’s compensation disclosure rules, which disclosure includes
the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the executive
compensation tables. Motivating and retaining a talented and experienced leadership team
is a key factor of Apple’s long-term success. We have a consistent and effective executive compensation program that incorporates
sound policies and best practices and delivers a majority of our named executive officers’ compensation through incentives that
are aligned with shareholder interests and Company performance. The compensation paid to our executive officers in 2023 aligns
with the continued strength of our financial results in an uneven macroeconomic environment and the significant progress made across
our core values and key community initiatives. We encourage shareholders to read the section entitled “Compensation Discussion
and Analysis,” beginning on page 46, which describes the details of our executive compensation program and the
People and Compensation Committee’s decision-making process with respect to our executive compensation program. 89% of votes cast on the Say on Pay
advisory proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of our executive compensation program. This result reflects the
expanded shareholder engagement efforts, and the positive shareholder response to the overall structure of our executive
compensation program and the changes to Mr. Cook’s 2023 total target compensation. Shareholders are being asked to approve the following resolution at
the Annual Meeting: RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers,
as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the SEC’s executive compensation disclosure rules, which disclosure includes
the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the executive compensation
tables, is hereby approved. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on Apple, the Board,
or the People and Compensation Committee. However, the People and Compensation Committee and the Board value the opinions expressed
by shareholders in their votes on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions
regarding named executive officers. We expect the next advisory Say on Pay vote will occur at the 2025
annual meeting of shareholders. The Board recommends a vote FOR Proposal No. 3 Vote Required Approval of Proposal No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

designated representatives that submitted proposals for consideration at the 2024 Annual Meeting to discuss their proposals and
Apple’s related policies and practices. These proposals, including any supporting statements, are included

Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 81 Shareholder Proposal Board Voting Recommendation Rationale 4 AGAINST EEO Policy Risk Report ● We are committed to nurturing a culture where every great idea can be heard and where everyone belongs, including those
        with differing viewpoints and ideologies. ● Our policies, practices, and trainings already address the proposal’s concern, and a report on potential risks to
        the Company of omitting “viewpoint” and “ideology” from our EEO Policy would not provide material
        additional information to shareholders. 5 AGAINST Report on Ensuring Respect for Civil Liberties ● Apple is committed to respecting human rights, including civil rights, freedom of expression, and access to information,
        and we review our procedures for administering the App Store for alignment with this commitment. ● We already provide the requested information about
the standards and procedures Apple uses to curate apps available in the App Store and about government orders to take down apps. 6 AGAINST Racial and Gender Pay Gaps ● We already have a comprehensive approach to promoting pay equity and diverse representation at every level of the Company,
        and since 2017 have achieved gender pay equity globally, as well as pay equity by race and ethnicity in the United States,
        and in 2022, we also achieved pay equity at the intersections of gender and race and ethnicity in our U.S. workforce. ● We provide robust disclosure regarding our progress on diverse representation on our Inclusion and Diversity website,
        including with respect to hiring and leadership roles, and we believe our programs, policies, and transparency represent
        a more meaningful approach to pay equity and diverse representation than the approach set forth in the proposal. 7 AGAINST Report on Use of AI ● We are committed to responsibly advancing our products and services that use AI, have a robust approach to addressing
        ethical considerations across our business operations, and already provide resources and transparency on our approach
        to artificial intelligence and machine learning. ● The scope of the requested report is extremely broad and could encompass disclosure of strategic plans and initiatives
        harmful to our competitive position and would be premature in this developing area. 8 AGAINST Congruency Report on Privacy and Human Rights ● We are deeply committed to respecting human rights
and are transparent about our approach to complex situations and prioritizing engagement. ● The requested report would not provide additional material information as our robust policies and disclosures are already
        publicly available. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 82 Identification of Proponents Proposals No. 4 through

Apple’s Secretary at One Apple Park Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA, or by phone at: (408) 974-3123. Vote Required Approval of Proposals 4-8 requires the affirmative vote of
(i) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority of
the shares required to constitute a quorum. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 83 Proposal No. 4 Shareholder Proposal Apple has been advised that the National Center for Public Policy
Research intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. EEO Policy Risk Report RESOLVED Shareholders request that Apple Inc. (“Apple”) issue
a public report detailing the potential risks associated with omitting “viewpoint” and “ideology” from
its written equal employment opportunity (EEO) policy. The report should be available within a reasonable timeframe, prepared at
a reasonable expense and omit proprietary information. SUPPORTING STATEMENT Apple does not explicitly prohibit discrimination based on viewpoint
or ideology in its written EEO policy. Apple’s lack of a company-wide best practice EEO policy
sends mixed signals to company employees and prospective employees and calls into question the extent to which individuals are
protected due to inconsistent state policies and the absence of federal protection for partisan activities. Approximately half
of Americans live and work in a jurisdiction with no legal protections if their employer takes action against them for their political
activities. Companies with inclusive policies are better able to recruit
the most talented employees from a broad labor pool, resolve complaints internally to avoid costly litigation or reputational damage,
and minimize employee turnover. Moreover, inclusive policies contribute to more efficient human capital management by eliminating
the need to maintain different policies in different locations. There is ample evidence that individuals with conservative viewpoints
may face discrimination at Apple. In general, Silicon Valley is hostile to
right-of-center thought. At the 2019 annual meeting of Apple shareholders, an audience member told company CEO Tim Cook about
her close friend who works at Apple and lives in fear of retribution every single day because she happens to be a conservative.
What she described was the textbook definition of a hostile work environment. Apple has also refused requests to increase the
viewpoint diversity of its board. (1) This also signals to employees that viewpoint
discrimination is condoned if not encouraged. Presently shareholders are unable to evaluate how Apple prevents
discrimination towards employees based on their ideology or viewpoint, mitigates employee concerns of potential discrimination,
and ensures a respectful and supportive work atmosphere that bolsters employee performance. Without an inclusive EEO policy, Apple may be sacrificing competitive
advantages relative to peers while simultaneously increasing company and shareholder exposure to reputational and financial risks. We recommend that the report evaluate risks including, but not
limited to, negative effects on employee hiring and retention, as well as litigation risks from conflicting state and company anti-discrimination
policies.

        be heard and where everyone belongs, including those with differing viewpoints and ideologies; ● our policies, practices, and trainings already address the proposal’s
        concern, and a report on potential risks to the Company of omitting “viewpoint” and “ideology” from our EEO
        policy would not provide material additional information to shareholders; and ● our Board maintains active oversight of our Apple values, including
        inclusion and diversity, and of matters relating to Apple’s people and teams. At Apple, we are committed to treating everyone with dignity
and respect and believe that both Apple and its shareholders benefit from nurturing a culture where everyone belongs. We are committed to nurturing
a culture where every great idea can be heard and where everyone belongs, including those with differing viewpoints
and ideologies. Inclusion and diversity is one of Apple’s values, which means we want every employee to feel a
sense of belonging in the workplace, where their perspectives are respected, sought out, and considered fairly. We believe
that when we create a workplace where everyone feels comfortable sharing their diverse experiences and perspectives, we
remove the barriers that prevent people from being fully engaged and, in turn, facilitate creativity and productivity. A culture of open dialogue and supportive feedback
also requires respect, including for those with different points of view. That is why respect is a foundational element of our
culture. It is necessary for great collaboration. It is necessary for great debate. It is necessary for our ideas, products, and
services to be as great as they can be. We believe every employee has a role in making our workplace respectful and welcoming for
everyone, which is why we require every Apple employee to participate in trainings on respect and inclusion. Our policies already address the
proposal’s concern and therefore a report would not provide additional material information. Because our commitment
to a respectful and inclusive workplace is broadly scoped and embedded across our policies, practices, and trainings, we
believe the risk to Apple of omitting viewpoint or ideology specifically from our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy (EEO
Policy) is low, and a report on potential risks would not provide material additional information to shareholders. Apple’s EEO Policy states that, “Apple is an equal
opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting” on many specifically enumerated
categories, including any “basis protected by law.” This latter protection would include any state or local law that
provides employees protection with respect to political activities or political affiliation, such as laws in locations like California,
New York State, and Washington D.C. While the proponent’s concerns are already addressed under applicable law, which flows
through to our EEO Policy, our commitment to inclusion and respect is broader and permeates all our policies and practices. Apple’s Business Conduct and
Compliance policies are foundational to how we do business and how we put our values into practice every day. In setting this
foundation, our Business Conduct Policy states, “Apple is dedicated to maintaining a creative, diverse, inclusive, and
supportive work environment, and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of employees or non-employees with whom we
have a business, service, or professional relationship,” thus anchoring our goal of fostering acceptance and supporting
diversity in all of its aspects, including diversity based on differing viewpoints and ideologies, in one of our main guiding
policies. All employees are required to complete training on the Business Conduct Policy upon hiring and annually thereafter.
And the training makes clear that maintaining a culture where our differences are celebrated is a responsibility shared by
everyone at Apple. We want to make sure we’re doing everything we can to safeguard
and reinforce a culture free from harassment and discrimination and to ensure employees feel fully empowered to report inappropriate
or discriminatory conduct, without fear of retaliation. That is why we also offer a range of resources for employees to address
questions and report concerns, including People Support, the Business Conduct Helpline, and the Business Conduct website, as well
as an external reporting hotline. All matters are carefully and thoroughly reviewed, and our policy strictly prohibits any retaliation
for reporting potential employee misconduct or participating in an investigation. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 85 We also regularly engage our employees in surveys to learn about
what’s going well and how we can do better in areas like career development, manager performance, and inclusivity, and teams
are encouraged to create action plans based on survey results. Notably, in our 2023 employee surveys, results indicate that employees
feel accepted at Apple, and that they can comfortably share ideas and opinions that are different from their team’s. Our Board maintains active oversight. Our People and Compensation
Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management’s strategies, policies, and practices relating to Apple’s
people and teams, including with respect to inclusion and diversity, culture and employee engagement, talent recruitment, development,
and retention, and our Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of matters relating to business conduct and legal and
regulatory compliance. Further, our Nominating Committee oversees Apple’s shareholder engagement strategy and response to
shareholder proposals and oversaw Apple’s recently completed Civil Rights Assessment published in July 2023. For all the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 4 Vote Required Approval of Proposal No. 4 requires the affirmative vote
of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority
of the shares required to constitute a quorum. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 86 Proposal No. 5 Shareholder Proposal Apple has been advised that the American Family Association, represented
by Bowyer Research, intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. Proposal: Report on Ensuring Respect for Civil Liberties Resolved: Shareholders request the Board of Directors conduct
an investigation and issue a report within the next 12 months, at reasonable cost and excluding proprietary information and disclosure
of anything that would constitute an admission of pending litigation, evaluating the standards and procedures Apple Inc. (“Apple”
or “the Company”) uses to curate app content on its various platforms, and procedures by which the Company manages
disputes between government interests and user rights. Supporting Statement: Given their facilitatory role in securing access to online services,
the actions of major tech companies can significantly affect the businesses using their platforms and ignite concerns over limiting
access to that content. Given their role in the online age, tech companies have a responsibility to use their influence to protect
such inherent human rights as “freedom of thought, conscience, and religion,” particularly for underprivileged and
marginalized populations. As shareholders of Apple Inc., we believe Apple is uniquely situated
to help protect these rights and ought to commit to maintaining access to app services as a necessary consequence of its commitment
to human rights. We are therefore greatly concerned at recent reports of Apple arbitrarily limiting content access within its online
services, as detailed below. This censorship endangers Apple’s trust with its users and jeopardizes Apple’s stated
commitments to human rights and providing quality products. Shareholders must know that Apple will meaningfully commit to protecting
reliable app access as a crucial aspect of both good social policy and respecting its users’ civil liberties. Apple has defended the connection between human
rights and technological access in its Commitment to Human Rights (1) , further asserting its primary emphasis on maintaining
users’ “access to reliable information and helpful technology.” Yet, recent actions call the veracity of such
commitments into question. Apple has been characterized by the 1792
Exchange as “leverag[ing] its corporate reputation and funds to support... groups hostile to freedom of
expression,” most recently the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Reporting indicates Apple’s removal of popular
Quran (2) (Quran Majeed) and Bible (3) (Olive Tree) reading apps from its App Store in China, at the
request of authorities within the CCP. Furthermore, as detailed in the 2022 edition of the Viewpoint Diversity Index (4) ,
Apple does not provide a clear standard as to what apps are and not allowed on its platforms, indicating a concerning absence
of protocol to determine what content is permissible (5) , further amplified by recent concerns over Apple’s
threat to remove Twitter (X) from its App Store (6) , a seemingly political swipe that conservative lawmakers have
characterized as a “raw exercise of monopolistic power.” (7) These actions conflict with
Apple’s stated Commitment to Human Rights and the interest of millions of Apple’s users in reliably accessing
content. Furthermore, the perception that Apple does not respect the civil liberties of its users and vendors
creates significant reputational risk and risk of political backlash, threatening shareholder value.

        human rights, including civil rights, freedom of expression, and access to information, and we review our procedures for
        administering the App Store for alignment with this commitment; and ● we already provide the requested
        information about the standards and procedures Apple uses to curate apps available in the App Store and about government
        orders to take down apps, all under the active oversight of our Board. Since it launched in 2008, the App Store has proven to be a safe and
trusted place to discover and download apps. We’re committed to creating a great experience for customers and developers
and review every app for compliance with our publicly posted App Store Review Guidelines to uphold the highest privacy, security,
and content standards. And we report extensively about how our App Store operates. We are committed to respecting human rights
and freedom of expression. Across our products and services, we strive to reflect our respect for human rights, including
privacy, freedom of expression, and non-discrimination, which is grounded in our Human Rights Policy. (1) We
review our app review process for alignment with best practices and our human rights commitments. And we engage with external
stakeholders that include United Nations bodies, nongovernmental organizations, investors, and human rights experts to seek feedback
on issues such as freedom of expression and access to information. We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times
there are complex considerations and issues where we may disagree with governments and other stakeholders on the most appropriate
path or outcome. In these instances, we prioritize engagement, advocating for the outcome we believe is in the best interests
of our users — their privacy, their ability to express themselves, and their ability to access reliable information and
helpful technology. We already publicly provide the
requested criteria that guide our App Store curation. The guiding principle of the App Store is simple — we want to
provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We do this by
offering a highly curated App Store where apps are reviewed by specialists, and an editorial team helps users discover new
apps every day. And we disclose the standards and procedures that we apply in reviewing apps in our publicly available App
Store Review Guidelines. (2) To fulfill our goals for the App Store, trained experts from our App Review team
review every app and app update for compliance with the App Review Guidelines, a process outlined in our Digital Services Act
Transparency Report. (3) The App Store review process is carried out by hundreds of human App Review
specialists, representing 81 languages across three time zones. All App Review specialists charged with continuing review of
apps published on the App Store receive comprehensive training when they join the App Review team. This training is
supplemented by ongoing training so that specialists remain informed of new and emerging threats and issues. App Review
specialists also receive language- and region-specific training that covers cultural and sensitivity issues as they relate to
enforcing the App Store Review Guidelines. Difficult decisions are escalated to Apple’s Executive Review Board,
composed of senior leaders who have ultimate decision-making responsibility regarding the App Store, including app takedowns,
further engagement, or an exploration of viable alternatives, as appropriate. As part of the review process, Apple works hard to prevent illegal
content from ending up on a country’s storefront. Apple seeks to abide by the laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, as
all companies operating in such jurisdictions must do. Whenever possible, apps that are removed from the App Store will only be
removed in countries and territories specific to the issue, and will remain available in locations that aren’t impacted.
If a developer believes their app should be reinstated on the App Store, they can appeal the removal. (1) investor.apple.com/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy (2) developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/ (3) apple.com/legal/dsa/transparency/eu/app-store/2310/ Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 88 We already provide the
requested reporting about government orders to take down apps. Apple reports transparently and comprehensively on our
efforts to help keep the App Store a safe and trusted place for users to find the apps they love. For calendar year 2022, we
expanded our prior biannual transparency reporting, which was focused on app removal requests by law enforcement and
regulatory agencies, to offer a comprehensive App Store Transparency Report. (4) In the App Store Transparency Report, we
disclose: ● the number of all apps removed, broken out by app category (e.g. games, utilities, business,
    education, etc.), with further break-out by country and region; ● the number of all apps removed for policy violations, broken out by App Store Review Guideline
    or Developer Program License Agreement provision violated, with further break-out by country and region; ● the number of all apps removed pursuant to government requests to remove illegal content,
    broken out by government entity and law cited; ● the number of appeals of app removals, broken out by country and region; and ● the number of app restorations after appeals, broken out by country and region. The App Store Transparency Report helps give developers and the public
a comprehensive and transparent view of how our guidelines work in practice, including with respect to government takedowns. We provide notice to developers of removed
apps. In addition to the information in the App Store Transparency Report, we provide notice directly to the affected developer
when an app is removed from the App Store, and the developer can appeal the removal if they believe the removal was made in error.
In the case of a government request to remove an app from the App Store, Apple has established a procedure so that the notice
to the developer includes details regarding the legal authority making the request and the legal basis that the authority cites
for doing so. This notice and appeal procedure is publicly disclosed on our website for developers. (5) We believe our approach of providing notice directly to developers
best meets their interests and expectations as it leaves the avenues of redress in their hands without publishing potentially sensitive
information. A developer can, however, always elect to make the details of the government request more widely available if they
choose to do so. Our Board maintains active oversight. Apple’s Board is
responsible for overseeing and periodically reviewing Apple’s Human Rights Policy, while Apple’s General Counsel is
responsible for its ongoing implementation and reports to the Board and its committees on progress and any significant issues identified
in the diligence process. The Board is also regularly updated on the App Store business, including legal and regulatory matters.
Our Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring our significant business risks, including operational and reputational exposures
that may relate to compliance with governmental laws, regulations, and orders, or to human rights issues. And our Nominating Committee
assists the Board in its oversight of Apple’s strategies, policies, and practices relating to environmental and social matters,
and oversaw our recently completed Civil Rights Assessment published in July 2023. For all the reasons above, the Board
        recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 5 Vote Required Approval of Proposal No. 5 requires
        the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual
        Meeting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. Racial and Gender Pay Gaps Whereas: Pay inequities
persist across race and gender and pose substantial risk to companies and society at large. Black workers’ hourly
median earnings represent 81 percent of white wages. The median income for women working full time is 83 percent that of men.
Intersecting race, Black women earn 64 percent, Native women 51 percent, and Latina women 54 percent. At the current rate,
women will not reach pay equity until 2059, Black women until 2130, and Latina women until
2224. (1) Citigroup estimates closing minority and gender
wage gaps 20 years ago could have generated 12 trillion dollars in additional income. PwC estimates closing the gender pay gap could
boost Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries’ economies by 2 trillion dollars annually. (2) Actively managing pay equity is associated with
improved representation, and diversity is linked to superior stock performance and return on equity. (3) Minorities
represent 58 percent of Apple’s workforce and 45 percent of leadership. Women represent 35 percent of Apple’s workforce and
32 percent of leadership. (4) Best practice pay equity reporting consists of two parts: 1. unadjusted median pay gaps, assessing equal opportunity
to high paying roles, 2.  statistically adjusted gaps,
assessing pay between minorities and non-minorities, men and women, performing similar roles. Apple reports only statistically adjusted gaps but ignores unadjusted
gaps, which address structural bias women and minorities face regarding job opportunity and pay, particularly when men hold most higher
paying jobs. Median pay gaps show, quite literally, how Apple assigns value to employees through the roles they inhabit and pay they receive.
Median gap reporting also provides a digestible and comparable data point to determine progress over time. Racial and gender median pay gaps are accepted
as the valid way of measuring pay inequity by the United States Census Bureau, Department of Labor, Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, and International Labor Organization. The United Kingdom and Ireland mandate disclosure of median gender
pay gaps. For its United Kingdom employees, Apple reports a median hourly and bonus gender pay gap of 13 percent. (5) Resolved: Shareholders request Apple report on median pay gaps across race and gender, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related
to recruiting and retaining diverse talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation
strategy and legal compliance information. Racial/gender pay gaps are defined as the difference between non-minority
and minority/male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of non-minority/male earnings (Wikipedia/OECD,
respectively). Supporting Statement: An annual report adequate for
investors to assess performance could, with board discretion, integrate base, bonus and equity compensation to calculate: ● percentage median gender pay gap, globally and/or by country, where appropriate ● percentage median racial/minority/ethnicity pay gap, US and/or

    to promoting pay equity and diverse representation at every level of the Company, and since 2017 have achieved gender pay equity globally,
    as well as pay equity by race and ethnicity in the United States, and since 2022, we have also achieved pay equity at the intersections
    of gender and race and ethnicity in our U.S. workforce; ● we also provide robust disclosure of our
    workforce representation on our Inclusion and Diversity website, including with respect to hiring and leadership roles, and we believe
    our programs, policies, and transparency represent a more meaningful approach to pay equity and diverse representation than the approach
    set forth in the proposal; ● we have strong programs and policies in place
    to foster an inclusive culture and promote diverse representation, and provide comprehensive benefits and competitive compensation; and ● inclusion and diversity is one of our Apple values, and our Board maintains active oversight of this area, we have a dedicated
    Vice President of Inclusion and Diversity, and we include a modifier based on Apple values and key community initiatives in the annual
    cash incentive program for our executives, reflecting our commitment to promoting values-driven leadership. At Apple, we’re always building on our long-standing
commitment to make our Company more inclusive and diverse and provide for equitable pay for all employees. We are committed to promoting pay equity and diverse
representation through our comprehensive approach. Consistent with our commitment to be a leader in
pay equity, every year we conduct a robust pay equity analysis encompassing the base salary, bonuses, and stock awards of 100% of our
employees that utilizes sophisticated data inputs to assess appropriate compensation bands for each employee, and adjustments are made
wherever employees fall below the appropriate range. These metrics are assessed by a third-party firm that evaluates compensation across
all of Apple using statistical modeling. We continuously review and seek to improve the accuracy of this analysis and also review gaps
within each line of business to determine whether there are any clusters in particular areas of the business that require further analysis. To further promote pay equity, it is our policy
not to ask employee candidates for compensation history, and our recruiters develop offers of employment based on location of hire, job
level, and job title. In addition, during our annual compensation planning process, our People team uses analytics to assess promotion
rates, performance ratings distribution, and pay metrics for women compared to men and, in the United States, for underrepresented groups
compared to non-underrepresented groups. We also seek to pay competitive wages across our global operations, and all employees are eligible
to become shareholders in the Company through our discretionary stock programs. The results of our efforts to achieve
pay equity are tangible. Since 2017, we have achieved gender pay equity globally, as well as pay equity by race and ethnicity
in the United States. Since 2022, we have also achieved pay equity at the intersections of gender and race and ethnicity in
our U.S. workforce. In July 2023, we published of a third-party Civil Rights Assessment report prepared by former
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his team at Covington & Burling LLP, which describes the significant resources
Apple has invested to rigorously track and manage pay equity across Apple. Consistent with our goal of promoting equal employment
opportunity, we also continue to focus on increasing diverse representation at every level of the Company to help Apple identify the best
talent in the world, and become an even better reflection of the world we live in. We do that by taking a comprehensive approach, from
expanding our diversity outreach efforts, including our ties with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving
Institutions (HSIs), and other organizations that serve and engage talent from underrepresented communities, and having more diverse interview
panels and candidates so that diversity is reflected at every stage of the hiring process, to fostering an inclusive culture and empowering
communities. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 91 Taking into consideration the comprehensive approach
we have and continue to promote with respect to pay equity, and given the diverse roles in our workforce and global operations, we do
not believe a single median pay figure is a meaningful metric for Apple. This statistic seeks to compare the median of two employees whose
compensation happens to fall at the midpoint of a pay distribution and does not account for valid factors that affect pay, such as role,
skills, qualifications, location, country, performance, and experience. Our shareholders would not benefit from a substitute measure for
our progress toward a more inclusive workforce, particularly one that does not lend itself to company-to-company comparison due to the
highly divergent composition of workforces based on industry and location. Apple fosters an inclusive culture to promote
diverse representation. At Apple, we believe building an inclusive culture rooted in community helps everyone, in every part of Apple,
feel supported, valued, connected, and empowered to do the best work of their lives. From day one, Apple employees have access to our
career development programs, ongoing inclusion and diversity education, and support throughout their career journeys. For example, our
global Career Experiences program enables hands-on development opportunities for Apple Store, service, and support team members by creating
months-long rotations in technical, operations, and corporate functions across Apple. Participants can build new skills, explore an aspirational
role up close, and gain in-role experience, while host teams benefit from the unique customer-facing perspectives, talents, and passions
of participants. Further, all our employees are required to complete
inclusion training, which reiterates our policies against harassment and discrimination. In addition, all our managers are required to
take inclusive leadership training, which emphasizes their responsibility in creating and fostering a safe, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for all of their employees. For more than 35 years, Apple employees have found
community and connection in our Diversity Network Associations (DNAs). These employee-led groups foster a culture of belonging through
education, leadership, development, networking, and volunteering, while also encouraging the kind of open dialogue that leads to stronger
allyship across Apple. Today, over 60,000 Apple employees across the globe belong to groups like Accessibility@Apple, AsianPacific@Apple,
Beacon@Apple, Black@Apple, Familia@Apple, Indigenous@Apple, Pride@Apple, SouthAsian@Apple, Women@Apple, and more. Apple empowers communities. Our work to increase
representation doesn’t stop at our own doors, and we believe our work supporting and empowering our communities will also help increase
diverse representation in our workforce. We are committed to supporting and empowering communities around the world, and to date have
committed more than $200 million to Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI). This funding supports projects and partnerships
across three priority areas: education, economic empowerment, and criminal justice reform. Apple also supports two distinct learning and innovation
hubs — the Propel Center and the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub — focused on building a diverse ecosystem of leaders. With
more than 75 percent of HBCUs now engaged with Propel, the opportunity to reach and serve thousands of HBCU faculty and students at scale
is significant. And with more than 500 HSIs now reaching over 2.2 million undergraduate students across the United States, the Global
HSI Equity Innovation Hub will collaborate with other California State University campuses and HSIs throughout the country to accelerate
educational equity while providing skills to support post-graduation success. And in collaboration with Michigan
State University, we launched our Apple Developer Academy in Detroit — our first in the United States — to
prepare students from all backgrounds for jobs in the iOS app economy. And in 2022, we established a partnership with
London’s Southbank Centre, which represents Apple’s first REJI expansion in Europe. In addition to the
fundamentals of coding, academy participants learn skills like design, marketing, and project management, with an emphasis on
inclusivity and making a positive impact in their communities. We already provide robust transparent reporting
and are working to further expand it in response to new regulations globally. Consistent with our goal of promoting equal employment
opportunity, we continue to focus on increasing diverse representation at every level of the Company to help Apple identify the best talent
in the world, and become an even better reflection of the world we live in. We are proud of the progress we have made, and share our progress
on our Inclusion and Diversity website, which provides data on the ratio of women and people from underrepresented communities in our
workforce, as well as within tech, nontech, leadership, retail, and retail leadership roles. We also share on our website statistics regarding
hiring for leadership positions. And we have been making our Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1 publicly available since 2015 in
the spirit of further transparency. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 92 In addition, numerous jurisdictions globally are at different stages
of adoption and implementation of legislation requiring the disclosure of pay gap metrics across a company’s workforce. Apple is
actively evaluating and preparing for these disclosures, incorporating learnings to its existing programs. As a result, the requested
report will be redundant and not confer any additional benefits to shareholders. Our Board maintains active oversight. Inclusion and diversity
is one of our Apple values and our Board and its committees maintain active oversight of this area. The Board receives regular updates
on diversity initiatives from our dedicated Vice President of Inclusion and Diversity, whose work aids in the hiring, development, and
retention of world-class talent, at all levels, that reflects the customers and communities we engage with. Our People and Compensation Committee is tasked with assisting the Board
in its oversight of Apple’s strategies, policies, and practices relating to its people and teams, including with respect to pay
equity, inclusion and diversity, culture and employee engagement, talent recruitment, development, and retention. The People and Compensation
Committee also includes a modifier based on Apple’s values and key community initiatives in the annual cash incentive program for
our executives, reflecting our commitment to promoting values-driven leadership. And our Nominating Committee is tasked with assisting the Board in its
oversight of strategies, policies, and practices relating to environmental and social matters and oversaw Apple’s Civil Rights Assessment
published in July 2023. For all the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 6 Vote Required Approval of Proposal No. 6 requires the affirmative vote of (i) a majority
    of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute
    a quorum. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 93 Proposal No. 7 Shareholder Proposal Apple has been advised that the AFL-CIO Equity Index
Funds, represented by Segal Marco Advisors, intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. Report on Use of AI RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Apple Inc. prepare
a transparency report on the company’s use of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) in its business operations and disclose
any ethical guidelines that the company has adopted regarding the company’s use of AI technology. This report shall be made publicly
available to the company’s shareholders on the company’s website, be prepared at a reasonable cost, and omit any information
that is proprietary, privileged, or violative of contractual obligations. Supporting Statement If adopted, this proposal asks our company to issue
a transparency report on the company’s use of AI technology and to disclose any ethical guidelines that the company has adopted
regarding AI technology. We believe that adopting an ethical framework for the use of AI technology will strengthen our company’s
position as a responsible and sustainable leader in its industry. By addressing the ethical considerations of AI in a transparent manner,
we can build trust among our company’s stakeholders and contribute positively to society. The adoption of AI technology into
business raises a number of significant social policy issues. For example, the use of AI in human resources decisions may
raise concerns about discrimination or bias against employees. The use of AI to automate jobs may result in mass layoffs and
the closing of entire facilities. AI may be used in ways that violate the privacy of customers and members of the public. AI
technology may be used to generate “deep fake” media content that may result in the dissemination of false
information in political elections. The White House Office of Science
and Technology Policy has developed a set of ethical guidelines to help guide the design, use, and deployment of AI. These
five principles for an AI Bill of Rights are 1) safe and effective systems, 2) algorithmic discrimination protections, 3)
data privacy, 4) notice and explanation, and 5) human alternatives, consideration, and fallback. (White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy, “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Making Automated Systems Work for the American
People,” October 2022, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights). We believe that the adoption of ethical
guidelines for the use of AI can help improve our company’s bottom line by avoiding costly labor disruptions. In 2023,
writers and performers went on strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers in part over concerns
that the use of AI technology to create media content will infringe on the intellectual property and publicity rights of
writers and performers and potentially displace human creators. (Wall Street Journal, “Hollywood’s Fight: How
Much AI Is Too Much?,” July 31, 2023, available at https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-the-core-of-hollywoods-ai-fight-how-far-is-too-far-f57630df). In our view, AI systems should not be trained on
copyrighted works, or the voices, likenesses and performances of professional performers, without transparency, consent and compensation
to creators and rights holders. We also believe that AI should not be used to create literary material, to replace or supplant the creative
work of professional writers. For these reasons, we urge you to vote FOR this
shareholder proposal. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 94 Apple’s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No. 7 AGAINST Proposal No. 7 The Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 7 because: ● we are committed to responsibly advancing our products and services
    that use artificial intelligence and already provide resources and transparency on our approach to artificial intelligence and machine
    learning, all under the active oversight of our Board; and ● the scope of the requested report is extremely broad and could
    encompass disclosure of strategic plans and initiatives harmful to our competitive position and would be premature in this developing
    area. At Apple, we believe the measure of any great innovation
is the positive impact it has on people’s lives. It’s why we work every day to make our technology an even greater force for
good. Today, our teams around the world work to infuse Apple’s deeply held values into everything we make. That work can take many
forms. But whether we’re protecting the right to privacy, designing technology that is accessible to all, or using more recycled
materials in our products than ever, we are always working to make a difference for the people we serve and the planet we inhabit. Apple has a robust approach to addressing ethical
considerations across our business operations and that addresses the issues raised in the proposal. We believe it’s important
to be deliberate and thoughtful in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence, and that companies think through the consequences
of new technology before releasing it — something we’ve always been deeply committed to at Apple. Social issues raised in
the proposal, like discrimination, bias, and privacy may be implicated by AI technologies, but are not unique to the application of AI.
Accordingly, our existing guidelines, policies, and procedures already address the social issues raised, as described below. Our approach to human rights: In all of
our work, Apple’s values are a driving force. We’re deeply committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights
in our business operations, (1) and align our efforts with the business and human rights due diligence process set
forth in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. As part of our processes, we conduct due diligence to identify
risks and work to mitigate them. This includes identification of salient human rights risks across our organization through internal
risk assessments and external industry-level third-party audits, as well as through communication channels maintained with rights holders
and other stakeholders. In 2023, we published a Civil Rights Assessment
report prepared by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his team at Covington & Burling LLP. The report reviews
Apple’s extensive efforts to respect civil rights and promote equity, diversity, and inclusion, and live by its core values, including
accessibility, inclusion and diversity, and privacy. These efforts, many of which began years ago, are reflected in Apple’s current
policies and practices, which are detailed in Covington’s report. Our approach to transparency: Apple’s
world-class machine learning and AI research team, led by our Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, collaborates
with teams across Apple to drive breakthrough advancements in machine learning, and we have a dedicated Apple Machine Learning Research
website (2) where we provide meaningful visibility into our machine learning research and aim to make our products
and services incorporating machine learning easy to understand. We also publish Human Interface Guidelines, (3) including
dedicated sections on Inclusion, Accessibility, Privacy, and Machine Learning, among others, to support developers in their work to build
inclusive apps that put people first by prioritizing respectful communication and presenting content and functionality in ways that everyone
can access and understand. Further, we provide tools, documentation, sample code, and design best practices to help developers make their
apps more accessible.

and our Human Interface Guidelines, Apple also reports extensively on our commitment to inclusion and diversity (4) and
privacy (5) throughout our business. We believe these disclosures provide a robust level of transparency to assure
stakeholders of our commitment to values-driven development while balancing the need to protect the proprietary information that is foundational
to our business. Our approach to inclusive design: We strive
to build products and services aligned with our values and human rights commitments, as noted in the Civil Rights Assessment report. To
cite just a few examples, Apple is engaged in an ongoing process to make Siri a more inclusive and accessible feature, including by engaging
socio-linguist experts to improve speech recognition accuracy rates for users of different ethnic/racial, gender, and geographic backgrounds
and working in partnership with Black and African American Vernacular English-speaking volunteers. Additionally, in developing Face ID,
Apple appreciated from the outset that facial recognition algorithms had been associated with divergent error rates across demographic
groups and so worked with volunteer participants from around the world to include a representative group of people accounting for gender,
age, ethnicity, disability, and other factors. And we’re taking steps to advance equity in our cameras’ person recognition
features. As a result, the machine learning models used in camera technology aim to show similar performance across various age groups,
genders, ethnicities, skin tones, and other attributes. Our approach to privacy: We also
believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, and we’re constantly innovating to give users more transparency and control
over their data. We regularly engage with civil society representatives globally on various privacy and freedom of expression
issues, including privacy by design and encryption, and our Privacy Policy (6) and service-specific privacy
notices (7) reflect our belief that privacy must remain a top priority in all that we do. Our management
Privacy Steering Committee sets privacy standards for teams across Apple and acts as an escalation point for addressing privacy
compliance issues. The committee is chaired by Apple’s General Counsel and its members include Apple’s Senior Vice
Presidents of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, Software, and Services, and a cross-functional group of senior representatives
from across the business. The scope of the requested report is overly broad
and could encompass disclosure of strategic plans and initiatives harmful to our competitive position. This proposal addresses our
use of artificial intelligence across our “business operations.” The proposal does not focus on any specific novel use of
AI at Apple and, in fact, references well-established applications of software such as automation of systems. Broadly defined, the requested
report could encompass every aspect of our business, including whether and how we use automated systems in, for example, product development
and research, supply chain management, financial management and planning, efficient management of energy use throughout our physical plant
and buildings, monitoring of cyber and physical security at our facilities, coordinating employee benefit or other personnel programs,
and conducting a wide range of other aspects of our business operations. Beyond our business operations, due to
its broad nature, the requested report would cover virtually every product and service Apple currently offers. To cite a few
examples, Siri™, which has been available for more than a decade, Personal Voice and Live Voicemail included in iOS 17,
and life saving features like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and ECG, would simply not be possible without the use of
artificial intelligence and machine learning. The broad scope of the proposal therefore speaks against preparing the report
requested, especially as the proponent does not point to any specific use of AI at Apple that raises concerns. Not only would
the report encompass every aspect of our operations and nearly every product or service we build, it could also cover
competitively harmful disclosure of confidential research and development activities. The AI regulatory landscape is rapidly evolving. Apple has been and will continue to be deliberate and thoughtful in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence. However,
this proposal is premature in asking for a dedicated report when the landscape is just starting to emerge and regulators around the world
are actively engaged in new rulemaking.

Apple’s Board plays
a vital and important role overseeing this work. The Board is responsible for overseeing and periodically reviewing our Human Rights Policy,
while Apple’s General Counsel is responsible for its ongoing implementation, and reports to the Board and its committees on our
progress and any significant issues identified during the diligence process. The Board also oversees corporate and product strategy and
receives regular updates on emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our Audit Committee assists the
Board in monitoring our significant business risks, including operational and reputational exposures that may relate to human rights issues.
The Audit Committee also reviews reports on privacy and data security matters from Apple’s General Counsel, and from the heads of
Information Security, Business Conduct and Compliance, Business Assurance, and Internal Audit. These reports include updates on Apple’s
privacy program, risk management, and relevant legislative, regulatory, and technical developments. Our People and Compensation Committee is tasked with assisting the Board

    of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute
    a quorum. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 97 Proposal No. 8 Shareholder Proposal Apple has been advised that the National Legal and Policy Center intends
to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. Congruency Report on Privacy and Human Rights WHEREAS: Inconsistency and incongruity persist between articulated
and published policies and actual practices and operations, and pose substantial risk to companies, their customers, and society at large. Apple Inc. (the “Company”)
“believe[s] security shouldn’t come at the expense of individual privacy.” (1) Its
published “commitment to human rights” espouses the following principles: (2) ● “We believe in the power of technology to empower and connect people around the world ...” ● “Our human rights policy governs how we treat everyone—from our customers and teams to our business partners ...” ● “We ... make technology for people that respects their human rights, [and] empowers them with useful tools and information ...” ● “We believe in the critical importance of an open society in which information flows freely, and we’re convinced the best way we can continue to promote openness is to remain engaged, even where we may disagree with a country’s laws ...” ● “We work every day to make quality products ... available to our users in a way that respects their human rights. We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments ...” While any freedom-loving individual would likely admire such principles,
Apple appears to implement — or rescind — them inconsistently across countries where it conducts business, and incongruently
with its principles. For example in China, the Company severely restricted use of its AirDrop
wireless filesharing feature on users’ iPhones during protests against Chairman Xi Jinping’s “zero COVID” policies in
late 2022. (3) Similarly, in 2017 Apple removed the New York Times’ s apps from the App Store in China in 2017, (4) and
removed apps including HKmap.live and Quartz from its offerings, during the protests in Hong Kong in 2019. (5) Yet upon
the invasion into Ukraine, the Company halted the sale of all its products in Russia and stopped exports into the country. (6) “We
are deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stand with all of the people who are suffering as a result of the violence,”
said an Apple spokesman. As a result, Apple stood to lose as much as $1.14 billion (U.S.) annually in iPhone sales alone, and the decision
removed access to Apple’s critical communications and services for victims of the war. (7) Considering these examples, it appears the Company’s principles to “empower
and connect people” as “a force for good” – while remaining “engaged” even where it disagrees with
a government and its laws, by still making its products “available” to users – has its limits. Resolved: Shareholders request
the Board of Directors issue a report by March 31,2025, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary or confidential
information, analyzing the congruency of the Company’s privacy and human rights policy positions with its actions,
especially in such places as war zones and under oppressive regimes, as they impact how the Company maintains its reputation,
viability and profitability.

    prioritizing engagement; and ● our robust policies and disclosures are publicly available, and
    our Board maintains active oversight of these areas, and therefore the requested report would not provide additional material information. Apple has long been committed to respecting human
rights, and we view that commitment as a core part of our values and our mission to enrich people’s lives. We also believe privacy
is a fundamental human right and innovate to build industry-leading privacy and security features into our products. We strive to conduct business ethically, honestly,
and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We have an effective governance and risk management structure to oversee this
work, and we report transparently on our efforts. Apple is deeply committed to respecting human
rights. At Apple, our North Star is creating great technology that empowers our customers and enriches their lives. People come first
in everything we do, and our respect for human rights includes our commitment to seeing that everyone is treated with dignity and respect. In 2020, our Board adopted
Apple’s Human Rights Policy. (1) The policy governs how we treat everyone, including people at
every level of our supply chain, as well as our customers, our employees, and our business partners. We are deeply committed
to respecting internationally recognized human rights in our business operations, as set out in the United Nations
International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles
and Rights at Work. Moreover, our approach is guided by the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights and reflects feedback that we have heard from our shareholders, as well as civil and human rights organizations and
other stakeholders. Our commitment to human rights extends to every facet of our business, from working to safeguard security
and user privacy in our products and promoting freedom of expression and access to information on our platforms to providing
a safe and respectful environment for all people in our supply chain. In July 2023, we published our Civil Rights Assessment
report prepared by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his team at Covington & Burling LLP. The report reviews
Apple’s extensive efforts to respect civil rights and to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion and live by its core values, including
accessibility, inclusion and diversity, and privacy. These efforts, many of which began years ago, are reflected in Apple’s current
policies and practices, which are detailed in Covington’s report. We are transparent about our approach to complex
situations and commitment to engagement. We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex considerations
and issues where we may disagree with governments and other stakeholders on the most appropriate path or outcome. In these instances,
we prioritize engagement, advocating for the outcome we believe is in the best interests of our users — their privacy, their ability
to express themselves, and their ability to access reliable information and helpful technology. Our Human Rights Policy specifies that, in keeping
with the UN Guiding Principles, where national law and international human rights standards conflict, “we respect national law while
seeking to respect the principles of internationally recognized human rights.” (1) investor.apple.com/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 99 Our robust policies and disclosures are publicly available and the
requested report would not provide additional material information. We publish extensive reports on how our efforts align with our
human rights and privacy policies, so the requested report would not provide shareholders with any additional material information. For
example: ● App Store Review Guidelines: we disclose the standards and procedures
  that we apply in reviewing apps in our publicly available App Store Review Guidelines (2) and on our Developer Support
  website. (3) The guiding principle of the App Store is simple — we want to provide a safe experience for users
  to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We do this by offering a highly curated App Store where
  apps are reviewed by experts, and an editorial team helps users discover new apps every day. ● App Store Transparency Report: we report transparently and
  comprehensively on our efforts to help keep the App Store a safe and trusted place for users to find the apps they love.
  Beginning with the 2022 calendar year, we expanded our prior biannual transparency reporting, which was focused on app
  removal requests by law enforcement and regulatory agencies, to offer a comprehensive App Store
  Transparency Report. (4) ● Privacy: our Privacy website (5) sets out Apple’s privacy features that demonstrate our commitment
to our core value of privacy, and our Privacy Policy (6) and service-specific privacy notices (7) provide
clear explanations of how we collect, use, and store information. ● Supplier Responsibility: our People and Environment in Our Supply Chain – 2023 Annual Progress Report (8) describes
how Apple upholds the highest standards across our supply chain, in our care for people and the planet, and our Supplier Code of Conduct (9) requires
the companies we do business with to abide by rigorous labor, health and safety, and environmental standards, and to respect the fundamental
human rights of all people. We set standards, and we verify they’re met through independent, third-party assessments. ● Environment: our Environmental Progress Report (10) describes how Apple’s
  efforts align with our Human Rights Policy by maintaining “the highest standards in our due diligence and respect for
  human rights,” and setting out Apple’s goals and progress. Our Board maintains active oversight of these areas. Apple’s Board is responsible for overseeing and periodically reviewing Apple’s
Human Rights Policy, while Apple’s General Counsel is responsible for its ongoing implementation and reports to the Board and its
committees on progress and any significant issues identified in the diligence process. The Board is also regularly updated on the App
Store business, including legal and regulatory matters. Our Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring our significant business risks,
including operational and reputational exposures that may relate to compliance with governmental laws, regulations, and orders, or to

1, 2023, the date of this report, the Audit and Finance Committee consisted of four members: Ron Sugar, who serves as the Chair
of the Committee, James Bell, Monica Lozano, and Sue Wagner. Each member is an independent director under Nasdaq and SEC rules,
and meets the standards for committee independence as set forth in Apple’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Audit and
Finance Committee has the duties and powers described in its written charter adopted by the Board. A copy of the charter is available
on Apple’s website at investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance .
The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board’s oversight and monitoring of: ● Apple’s
financial statements and other financial information provided by Apple to its shareholders and others; ● compliance with legal, regulatory, and public disclosure requirements; ● the independent auditors, including their qualifications and independence; ● Apple’s system of internal controls, including the internal audit
        function; ● treasury and finance matters; ● enterprise risk management, privacy, and data security; ● and the auditing, accounting, and financial reporting process generally. The Audit and Finance Committee does
not itself prepare financial statements or perform audits, and its members are not auditors or certifiers of Apple’s
financial statements. The Audit and Finance Committee
is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the work performed by Apple’s independent registered
public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP. In fulfilling its oversight responsibility, the Audit and Finance Committee carefully
reviews the policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the scope
of the audit, audit fees, auditor independence matters, performance of the independent auditors, and the extent to which the independent
registered public accounting firm may be retained to perform non-audit services. Ernst & Young has served as Apple’s
independent registered public accounting firm since 2009 and rotates its lead audit engagement partner every five years. The Audit
Committee is directly involved in the selection of the lead engagement partner. Apple maintains an auditor
independence policy that, among other things, prohibits Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm from performing
non-financial consulting services, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This policy mandates
that the Audit and Finance Committee approve in advance the audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent
registered public accounting firm and the related budget, and that the Audit and Finance Committee be provided with quarterly reporting
on actual spending. This policy also mandates that Apple may not enter into engagements with Apple’s independent registered
public accounting firm for non-audit services without the express pre-approval of the Audit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed
and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023 with Apple’s management and Ernst &
Young. The Audit and Finance Committee has also discussed with Ernst & Young the matters required to be discussed by the
applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) and the SEC. The Audit and Finance Committee also has
received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young required by applicable requirements of
the PCAOB regarding Ernst & Young’s communications with the Audit and Finance Committee concerning independence,
and has discussed with Ernst & Young its independence. Based on the reviews and discussions referred
to above, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to the Board that the financial statements referred to above be included
in Apple’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023 for filing with the SEC.

statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our
environmental, social, and governance goals, commitments, and strategies, and our executive compensation program. These
statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from any future results expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including due to the risks, uncertainties, and other
important factors that are discussed in our most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and subsequent
filings. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Proxy Materials are Available on the Internet Apple uses the internet as the primary means
of furnishing proxy materials to shareholders. We are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “Notice
of Internet Availability”) to our shareholders with instructions on how to access the proxy materials online at proxyvote.com or
request a printed copy of the materials. Shareholders may follow the instructions
in the Notice of Internet Availability to elect to receive future proxy materials in print by mail or electronically by email.
We encourage shareholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials online to help reduce the environmental
impact of our annual meetings and reduce Apple’s printing and mailing costs. Apple’s proxy materials are also available at investor.apple.com . Eliminating Duplicate Mailings Apple has adopted a procedure called “householding.”

by mail, this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023 to multiple shareholders
who share the same address, unless Apple has received contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders. This procedure
reduces the environmental impact of our annual meetings and reduces Apple’s printing and mailing costs. Shareholders who
participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. Upon written or oral request, Apple will deliver promptly
a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability and, if you requested printed versions by mail, this Proxy Statement and

Annual Meeting and reconvene the Annual Meeting at a later date. Inspector of Election A representative of Broadridge Investor
Communication Solutions, Inc. will serve as the inspector of election. Proxy Solicitation Costs Apple is paying the costs of the solicitation
of proxies. Apple has retained Georgeson LLC to assist in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of proxies
from individual shareholders as well as brokerage firms, fiduciaries, custodians, and other similar organizations representing

amounts for additional proxy solicitation services and out-of-pocket expenses. In addition to solicitations by mail, the
proxy solicitor and Apple’s nominees, officers, and employees, without additional compensation, may solicit proxies on Apple’s
behalf in person, by phone, or by electronic communication. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 109 Apple’s Fiscal Year Apple’s fiscal year is the 52-

                                         and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then the persons
                                         named as proxy holders, Kate Adams and Luca Maestri, will vote your shares in the manner
                                         recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement and as they
                                         may determine in their best judgment with respect to any other matters properly presented
                                         for a vote at the Annual Meeting. Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street
Name If you are a beneficial owner of shares
held in street name and do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, then the organization
may generally vote your shares in their discretion on “routine” matters, but cannot vote on “non-routine”
matters. Routine and Non-Routine Proposals The following proposal is considered a routine
matter: ● The
                                         ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Apple’s independent
                                         registered public accounting firm for 2024 (Proposal No. 2). A broker or other nominee may generally
vote in their discretion on routine matters, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected in connection with Proposal No. 2. The following proposals are considered non-routine matters: ● Election
                                         of directors (Proposal No. 1); ● Advisory
                                         vote to approve executive compensation (Proposal No. 3); and ● Each
                                         of the shareholder proposals (Proposals No. 4 through No. 8). If the organization that holds your shares
does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, that organization will inform the inspector
of election that it does not have the authority to vote on the matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to
as a “broker non-vote.” Therefore, broker non-votes may exist in connection with Proposal No. 1 and Proposals
No. 3 through No. 8. Back to Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information 2024 Proxy Statement 111 Vote Required to Approve a Proposal With respect to the election of directors
(Proposal No. 1), Apple’s bylaws provide that, in an uncontested election of directors, the affirmative vote of (i) a
majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting, and (ii) a majority of the shares
required to constitute a quorum is required to elect a director. An “uncontested election of directors” means an election
of directors in which the number of candidates for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by the shareholders
at that election. Approval of Proposals No. 2 through
No. 8 requires, in each case, the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and
voting at the Annual Meeting, and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions Broker non-votes and abstentions are counted
for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Only “FOR” and “AGAINST” votes are counted for
purposes of determining the votes received in connection with each proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect
on determining whether the affirmative vote constitutes a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at
the Annual Meeting. In addition, for each proposal, the affirmative
vote equal to a majority of the shares necessary to constitute a quorum is also required for approval. Therefore, broker non-votes
and abstentions could prevent the election of a director or the approval of a proposal because they do not count as affirmative
votes. Confidentiality of Votes Proxy instructions, ballots, and voting
tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Apple will not disclose
the proxy instructions or ballots of individual shareholders, except: ● To
                                         allow for the tabulation and certification of votes; ● To
                                         facilitate a successful proxy solicitation; ● To
                                         assert claims for Apple; ● To
                                         defend claims against Apple; and ● As
                                         necessary to meet applicable legal requirements. If you write comments on your proxy card
or ballot, the proxy card or ballot may be forwarded to Apple’s management and the Board to review your comments. Tabulation and Reporting of Voting Results Preliminary voting results will be announced
at the Annual Meeting. Final voting results will be tallied by the inspector of election after the taking of the vote at the Annual
Meeting. Apple will publish the final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days
following the Annual Meeting. Director Nominations and Other Matters for the 2025 Annual
Meeting of Shareholders Proposals and director nominations must
