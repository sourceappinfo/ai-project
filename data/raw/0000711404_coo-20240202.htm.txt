(the “Company” or “Cooper”), which will be held at 8:00 a.m. (Pacific Time) on Tuesday, March 19, 2024, at our corporate headquarters at 6101 Bollinger Canyon Road, Suite 500, San Ramon, California. At the Annual Meeting, we will ask our stockholders to vote on the proposals detailed in our Proxy Statement and related materials. We will be providing access to our proxy materials electronically under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s “notice and access” rules. As a result, beginning on or about February 8, 2024, we are mailing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “Notice”) to many of our stockholders instead of paper copies of this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”). This approach conserves natural resources and reduces our printing and distribution costs, while providing a timely and convenient method of accessing the materials and voting. The Notice contains instructions on how to either access our materials through the internet or receive a paper copy of our proxy materials, including the Proxy Statement, the 2023 Annual Report, and a form of proxy card or voting instruction card. All stockholders who do not receive a Notice, including stockholders who have previously requested to receive paper copies of proxy materials, will receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail. Your vote is important. Regardless of whether you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we hope you will vote as soon as possible. You may vote by proxy by following the instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction card. Voting may be done over the internet, by telephone, or by mail (if you received paper copies of the proxy materials). Voting by proxy will ensure your representation at the Annual Meeting. We look forward to seeing you at the Annual Meeting. Sincerely, Robert S.

We also maintain an independent Lead Director position. We believe this division provides a balance between the independence of our directors and the experience of our officers. Our current Chair has significant business experience with the Company but has also been affirmatively determined to be independent by our Board. We feel that maintaining a separation between the Chair and the CEO provides for strong, knowledgeable leadership of the Board separate from the CEO’s immediate, day-to-day involvement with the Company. Meetings The Board and its committees met as follows during our most recent fiscal year: Number of Meetings Board of Directors 6 Audit Committee 6 Organization & Compensation Committee 5 Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee 4 The non-employee directors hold executive sessions in connection with regular meetings of the Board and more often as they deem appropriate. Either Mr. Weiss, as Chair, or Mr. Kozy, as Lead Director, presides over executive sessions. During the 2023 fiscal year, each director attended at least 75% of the board meetings and meetings of committees on which the director served. We do not maintain a formal policy regarding director attendance at the Annual Meeting. Director Independence In making determinations regarding independence, the Board considers the objective requirements for independence set forth by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”). In the 2023 fiscal year, the Board also considered the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). The Board has confirmed that each independent director has no relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Board and its committees conduct regular self-evaluations and review director independence and committee composition to ensure continued compliance with applicable regulations. Additionally, under our Amended and Restated Corporate Governance Principles, directors are not permitted to serve on the boards of more than two other public companies while they serve on our Board; provided, that the Board may make exceptions to this standard as it deems appropriate in the interest of our stockholders. We do not limit service on private company boards of directors or with non-profit organizations. The Board considers these affiliations and professional relationships on a case-by-case basis to ensure there are no conflicts of interest with the Company or other factors that would impair the relevant non-employee director’s independence from the Company. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 5 Director Nomination Process The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee (the “CGNC”) is responsible for identification and recommendation of qualified candidates to present to the Board for consideration as director nominees. As part of this responsibility, the CGNC annually considers the size, composition, diversity, and responsibilities of the Board. The CGNC considers the background and skills of the current board members, the needs of the Board, and the qualifications of any potential candidates prior to making recommendations regarding nominations. Stockholder nominations must be received on a timely basis and meet the criteria set forth below and in the information on Stockholder Proposals and Nominations for Director . Criteria for Nominees The CGNC has set minimum criteria which must be met by any director candidate as follows: (1) meet the objective independence requirements set forth by the SEC and Nasdaq (other than executive nominees), (2) exhibit strong personal integrity, character, and ethics, and a commitment to ethical business and accounting practices, (3) demonstrate an understanding of, and commitment to, good governance practices and the fiduciary responsibilities expected of a director, (4) have an appropriate educational background and significant business or professional experience, (5) not serve on more than two other public company boards, (6) not be involved in on-going litigation with Cooper or be employed by an entity which is engaged in such litigation, and (7) not be the subject of any on-going criminal investigations, including investigations for fraud or financial misconduct. In addition to these minimum standards, the CGNC considers whether a candidate has any special expertise, skills, characteristics, or qualifications that would be of particular benefit to the Company or that address a need for specific operational, management, or other expertise. The CGNC seeks candidates who demonstrate an understanding of financial statements and financial matters, offer business and managerial experience that complements the experience of current directors, and provide additional depth of knowledge that will provide practical insights and diverse perspectives that will benefit the Board in its oversight of our business. Diversity and Inclusion The CGNC also considers whether a candidate’s personal and professional background will strengthen the overall diversity of the Board and enhance the quality of deliberations and decisions. While we do not have a formal diversity policy for Board membership, the CGNC believes it is important to have directors from various backgrounds and professions to ensure that the Board has a wealth of experiences to inform its decisions. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 6 Consistent with this philosophy, the CGNC seeks directors who represent a mix of backgrounds, skills, and experiences and is committed to including candidates in each search who reflect diverse backgrounds, including candidates of diverse ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, education, cultural background, and professional experiences. As of February 1, 2024 Total Number of Directors 9 Female Male Non-Binary Did Not Disclose Gender Identity: 4 5 — — Demographic Background: African American or Black — — — — Alaskan Native or Native American — — — — Asian — — — — Hispanic/Latinx 1 — — — Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian — — — — White 3 5 — — Two (or more) Races or Ethnicities — — — — LGBTQIA+ — — — — Did not disclose — — — — Board Refreshment The Board has not adopted formal term limits or retirement age requirements, as it believes these are arbitrary and limit the ability to retain directors with valuable experience and company knowledge. However, the Board is committed to refreshment of the board of directors on a regular basis to ensure a balance of innovative ideas with experienced leadership. In furtherance of this commitment, the Board has worked actively to develop internal policies and practices to ensure regular refreshment of appointments and the CGNC has developed a succession planning framework to ensure continued refreshment of Board appointments. Five of our current directors joined the Board within the past five years, and seven of our nine directors have served for no more than ten years. The Board views the current composition as a meaningful demonstration of its efforts to refresh its membership and expects to continue these efforts going forward. Board Committees The Board currently maintains three standing committees as described below. Committee membership is determined by the Board and reviewed regularly. As required by the SEC and Nasdaq, all members of our Audit Committee, CGNC, and Organization & Compensation Committee (“OCC”) are independent directors. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 7 Each committee maintains a written charter detailing its authority and responsibilities. These charters are updated periodically as legislative and regulatory developments and business circumstances warrant. All committee charters are available on our website at http://investor.coopercos.com/corporate-governance . Audit Committee Members The Audit Committee provides advice with respect to our financial matters and assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding: (i) the quality and integrity of the Company’s financial statements, (ii) the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (iii) review of our potential risk factors, (iv) our system of internal accounting and financial controls, (v) our enterprise risk management program, (vi) the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm (the “Independent Auditors”) and (vii) the oversight and performance of the Company’s internal audit function and the Independent Auditors. The Audit Committee advises and makes recommendations to the Board regarding our financial, investment, and accounting procedures and practices. The Audit Committee also has oversight responsibility for review of any related party transactions (as defined under Item 404 of Regulation S-K), treasury and investment matters, and the Company’s information security programs. Each of Ms. Madden, Mr. Kurzius, and Ms. Lucchese are Audit Committee Financial Experts as defined by the SEC. Additional information regarding the Audit Committee and its responsibilities can be found below in the information on Audit Matters . Teresa S. Madden (Chair) ___________ Lawrence E. Kurzius Cynthia L. Lucchese Gary S. Petersmeyer Maria Rivas, M.D. Organization & Compensation Committee Members The OCC reviews and approves all aspects of the compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer and our executive officers as defined by Rule 3b-7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Members of the OCC are not eligible to participate in any of our executive compensation programs. The OCC approves the composition of our peer group for comparative compensation review, the terms of our incentive compensation and equity-based plans (including the allocation and terms of equity awards to employees), corporate goals and objectives for the Chief Executive Officer, and any agreements providing for the payment of benefits following a change in control of the Company. The OCC also advises and makes recommendations to the Board regarding annual compensation of the non-employee directors. The OCC has oversight responsibility for our retirement programs and human capital management practices, including succession planning, diversity & inclusion objectives, and other management development programs designed to strengthen our internal pool of candidates for executive level positions and promote mentoring of senior level employees.

Petersmeyer _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 8 Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee Members The CGNC develops, implements, and maintains our corporate governance standards. It advises and makes recommendations to the Board concerning our primary governance policies, proposed changes to our charter and by-laws, proposed changes to the charters of the Board committees, and procedures for reporting violations of our policies and standards. The CGNC also monitors compliance with our Code of Conduct and other policies by our directors and officers and has responsibility for review of any conflicts of interest (actual or potential). The CGNC performs the functions described below under Director Nomination Process and makes recommendations regarding the composition, function, and size of the Board and its Committees, standards for the Board’s review of its own performance, continuing education for directors, and matters related to Board refreshment and succession planning. The CGNC also oversees our compliance programs and our Environmental, Social and Governance initiatives as discussed in more detail below. William A. Kozy (Chair) ___________ Colleen E. Jay Cynthia L. Lucchese Maria Rivas, M.D. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 9 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE We have an ongoing commitment to good governance and business practices. In furtherance of this commitment, we regularly monitor developments around corporate governance and review our policies and practices as needed. We seek to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, and to implement other corporate governance practices we believe are in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. In keeping with this commitment: • All members of our Board are independent, other than Mr. White (our Chief Executive Officer). • All members of the committees of our Board are independent. • Board members stand for re-election annually and our corporate Bylaws include a majority voting standard for the election of our directors. • Our Bylaws include proxy access provisions. • The Board is active in oversight of risk and risk management. • We do not maintain a stockholder rights plan (“poison pill”). • We are committed to corporate social responsibility and sustainability. Additionally, we maintain various corporate policies, discussed in more detail below, that reflect our dedication to good governance. We believe that the policies and practices currently in place enhance our stockholders’ interests. Corporate Governance Policies Corporate Governance Principles We maintain Corporate Governance Principles which specify our standards for director qualifications, director responsibilities, Board committees, director access to our executive officers and employees, director orientation and continuing education, and performance evaluations of the Chief Executive Officer and of the Board and its committees. The Corporate Governance Principles also address compensation and stock ownership requirements for our non-employee directors (discussed in more detail in the section on Director Compensation ). The Corporate Governance Principles are available in their entirety on our website at http://investor.coopercos.com/corporate-governance . Code of Conduct Our Code of Conduct (the “Code”) was adopted in June 2021 and replaced our prior Ethics & Business Conduct Policy. The Code is designed to reflect current best practices, enhance and expand on the Company's position regarding maintenance of ethical business practices, elaborate on certain topics such as human rights, diversity, inclusion, and equality, and promote awareness of ethical issues that may be encountered in carrying out an employee’s or director’s responsibilities. We have designed the Code to provide guidance regarding compliance with laws, regulations, and Company policies, and we regularly communicate with employees regarding the Code to ensure familiarity and awareness. The Code applies to all employees, including executive officers, and to non- _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 10 employee directors, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and we require that employees annually certify their agreement to abide by the policy. The Code provides guidance on multiple topics, including: (i) conflicts of interest, (ii) the protection and proper use of Company assets, (iii) relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors, and associates, (iv) government relations and anti-corruption regulations, and (v) compliance with laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to insider trading, equal employment opportunity, harassment, and health and safety. We have also added content regarding preventing fraud and money laundering, use of social media, promoting human rights, diversity and equity, and our commitments to environmental and social initiatives. Employees are encouraged to report any conduct that they believe in good faith to be an actual or apparent violation of the Code. The Code has been translated into multiple languages to facilitate readability and all employees receive a copy of the Code both at their date of hire and annually. The Code is also posted on our internal web pages for ease of access and is available in its entirety on our website at https://investor.coopercos.com/ethics-compliance . Amendments to the Code, and any waivers of the Code granted to directors or executive officers, will be made available through our website. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, no waivers have been requested or granted, and adoption of the current Code did not result in any explicit or implicit waiver of any provision of the Ethics & Business Conduct Policy in effect prior to the adoption of the Code. Stock Trading Policy: Hedging & Pledging We have implemented a Stock Trading Policy that applies to senior executives, including our Named Executive Officers and all members of the Board of Directors. Under this Policy, trading in Company securities is prohibited except during specifically designated windows. Additionally, executives and members of the Board are prohibited from engaging in various trading practices which would suggest speculation in our securities, including short sales, puts, calls, forward sales, equity swaps, or other hedging transactions. Our Policy does permit executives and members of the Board to pledge securities as collateral, but only upon prior notice to, and approval from, the Company. Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives We believe that conducting business in a socially and environmentally responsible manner is important to our long-term success. Recognizing the impact that ESG matters have on our business, we are expanding existing initiatives and actively developing new projects to ensure sustainability and corporate responsibility remains a key focus of our business. To ensure support and advancement of these initiatives, the CGNC has oversight responsibility for our overall ESG strategy under its charter. In this capacity, the CGNC has general oversight authority for our overall ESG strategy, but specific topics continue to be overseen by other committees as appropriate, including cybersecurity oversight by the Audit Committee and human capital management review by the OCC. Additionally, our Board continues to have regular ESG discussions at its meetings. We released our annual ESG Report in May 2023, and it can be found on our public website at https://www.coopercos.com/esg/ . The report is designed to provide transparency regarding our ESG efforts, and we encourage you to read it for information regarding our ESG initiatives, activities in furtherance of _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 11 our commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, diversity and inclusion efforts, human capital management, and commitments to data privacy and security. Highlights from the report include: • We continue to partner with PlasticBank to provide net plastic-neutral contact lens products. This initiative prevented the equivalent of more than 100 million plastic bottles reaching the ocean in 2022. • The CooperVision distribution facility in New York obtained LEED/Breeam Certification, increasing the number of our certified facilities from 7 to 8. • Through our environmental impact initiatives, we reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 7% year over year. This reduction was supported by increased use of our new power plant facility in Puerto Rico and 100% renewable electricity sourcing at all key facilities in New York and the United Kingdom. • We continued and expanded partnerships with non-profit organizations to expand access to eye exams, vision care, and vision correction, and expand access to reproductive healthcare and fertility treatment. In addition to our ESG Report, additional information regarding our corporate responsibility initiatives can be found on our website at http://www.coopercos.com/corporate-responsibility . Although we encourage our stockholders to review the information in our ESG Report and on our website, the contents of the report and website are not deemed filed with the SEC and are not incorporated by reference into any filing by Cooper under the Exchange Act. Board of Directors’ Role in Risk Oversight General Our Board recognizes the importance of appropriate oversight of potential business risks in running a successful operation and meeting its fiduciary obligations to our business and our stockholders. While our management team has responsibility for the day-to-day assessment and management of potential business risks, the Board maintains responsibility for ensuring an appropriate culture of risk management and setting the proper “tone at the top.” In this function, the Board, directly and through its committees, has oversight responsibilities for our risk management process and in understanding the steps taken by management to address specific risks, including competitive, legal, regulatory, operational, and financial risks. Each committee of the Board also regularly assesses risks related to its area of focus in connection with execution of committee responsibilities. For this purpose, each committee has the ability to engage outside advisors as needed, regularly meets in executive session with key management personnel, and maintains full access to management. The Board believes that delegation of certain responsibilities and oversight functions to its committees allows for more robust oversight process, utilizing the technical expertise and subject matter focus of the Board's individual committees. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 12 Enterprise Risk Management To further strengthen risk oversight, we have adopted an enterprise risk management ("ERM") program led by a Risk Leadership Committee ("RLC") that includes our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and our General Counsel. The RLC is supported by a Global Risk Committee composed of senior business leaders tasked with providing periodic assessments of the key risks, mitigation activities, and trends related to their functional areas. These assessments are reviewed by the RLC and compiled into a formal report provided to the Audit Committee at least annually. The ERM program combines with regular processes and communications throughout the Company, including between management and the Board and Board committees, to ensure business risks are addressed continually in a structured manner. Cybersecurity Risks The Audit Committee has oversight authority for our information security programs and receives updates at least quarterly from management on matters related to cybersecurity incidents. Our information technology (IT) leadership also provides a detailed, in-person update to the Audit Committee at least annually. This update includes a discussion of significant threats to our systems, risk mitigation strategies, program assessments, planned improvements, and status of information security initiatives. We also maintain a cyber insurance policy that provides coverage for security breach recovery and response. Additional information regarding our cybersecurity program can be found in our 2023 Annual Report. Risk and Compensation The OCC regularly reviews and assesses the possible risks related to our compensation programs. Based on this assessment, the OCC has concluded that the structure of our compensation programs does not create unreasonable risk or the likelihood of a material adverse impact on the Company. In making this determination, the OCC considered possible compensation-based risks and means by which potential risks may be mitigated, including the operation of our internal control structure and the Committee’s oversight. The OCC also considered the structure of our compensation programs, including: • Oversight of executive compensation by an independent committee of the Board. • Use of an independent compensation consultant and annual review of compensation against an appropriate peer group. • The use of a combination of short- and long-term compensation programs to create a balanced mix of pay components for our executives. • Capped bonus targets for annual incentives and equity grant guidelines to govern the size of grants. • Equity ownership guidelines for our senior executives to strengthen the connection between executive and stockholder interests. • A compensation recovery (“clawback”) policy to reduce the risk that executives would be motivated to maximize performance in a specific period over long-term goals. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 13 • Double-trigger change-in-control provisions in agreements with our Named Executive Officers to prevent guaranteed payouts (see Potential Payments Upon Termination ). Additional information regarding our executive compensation program and how financial performance is tied to the compensation of our NEOs can be found in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis . Management Succession Planning At least annually, and more often as deemed appropriate, the OCC meets with management to discuss succession plans for our executive management, including our Chief Executive Officer. Succession plans are designed to allow for an orderly transition of top executive posts either in the ordinary course of business or in response to emergency situations. Management develops and presents plans for identification, mentoring, and continuing development of potential internal candidates for executive leadership positions. The Committee provides oversight, input, and recommendations regarding the criteria to be used for identification of potential candidates for succession to leadership positions. The Committee also meets with individual members of management occasionally throughout the year to assess leadership development within the executive team. Related Party Transactions We review all relationships and transactions in which the Company and our directors and executive officers, or their immediate family members, are participants. The Company’s legal and governance staff is primarily responsible for monitoring and obtaining information from the directors and executive officers with respect to related party transactions and for then determining, based on the facts and circumstances, whether the Company or a related party has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction. Management reports related party transactions to the Audit Committee in accordance with written policy and the Audit Committee reviews and approves (or ratifies) all transactions between the Company and related parties that are required to be disclosed under SEC rules. Under this policy, the Audit Committee has deemed certain transactions to be pre-approved or ratified even if the aggregate amount involved exceeds thresholds that would otherwise require disclosure as follows: • Compensation paid for service as executive officer of the Company, provided such compensation has been approved by the OCC and the executive officer is not an immediate family member of another related party; • Transactions involving the recovery of incentive-based compensation as required under any policy established by the Company for that purpose; • Compensation for service as a non-employee director provided such compensation is required to be reported in the Company's proxy statement; • Transactions where the related party’s only interest arises from the ownership of the Company’s common stock and all holders of the Company's common stock received the same benefit on a pro rata basis (such as payment of regular dividends or stock splits), • Transactions between parent and subsidiary entities within the Company’s subsidiary structure, joint ventures, equity investments, and limited liability entities, • Transactions where law or government authority regulate the rates or charges, and _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 14 • Transactions involving services as a bank depository of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee under a trust indenture, or similar services. KPMG, as our independent registered public accounting firm, reviews our controls around the identification and reporting of related party transactions as required by current accounting and auditing standards. We have determined that there were no related party transactions requiring disclosure during the 2023 fiscal year. Audit Matters The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities relate to the reliability and integrity of our accounting policies, financial reporting and financial disclosure practices, the maintenance of our system of internal accounting and financial controls, and the retention and termination of our independent registered public accounting firm (the “Independent Auditors”). The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding: (i) the quality and integrity of the Company’s financial statements, (ii) the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (iii) review of our potential risk factors, (iv) the qualifications and independence of the Independent Auditors, and (v) the oversight and performance of the Company’s internal audit function and the Independent Auditors. Additionally, the Audit Committee assists the Board with risk oversight, as discussed above, including review of our enterprise risk management programs and oversight of cybersecurity, treasury and investment matters, and related party transactions. Governance The Audit Committee operates under a written charter which can be found on our website at http://investor.coopercos.com/corporate-governance. The Audit Committee regularly reviews its charter to ensure that it is meeting all relevant policy requirements of the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and Nasdaq. Member Qualifications The Audit Committee had five members until our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and four members for the remainder of the 2023 fiscal year. Our Board determined that all five directors serving on the Audit Committee during the year were independent directors as required by the SEC and each of the NYSE and Nasdaq. The Board further determined that all five members serving during the 2023 fiscal year met the financial literacy requirements of the NYSE and the financial sophistication requirements of Nasdaq. Additionally, both Ms. Lucchese and Ms. Madden were determined to meet the qualifications for an audit committee financial expert as defined by the SEC (as was former director, Jody S. Lindell, until her retirement as of the date of the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders). Mr. Kurzius was appointed to the Audit Committee after the start of the 2024 fiscal year. Prior to his appointment, the Board determined that Mr. Kurzius was independent as required by the SEC and Nasdaq. Since his appointment, the Board further determined that Mr. Kurzius meets the financial _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 15 sophistication requirements of Nasdaq and the qualifications for an audit committee financial expert as defined by the SEC. Internal Controls The Company has a full-time internal audit function that reports to the Audit Committee and the Chief Financial Officer, and is responsible for, among other things, objectively reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness, and quality of the Company’s system of internal controls. To support this work, management has engaged Ernst & Young LLP to assist the Company’s internal audit team. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight and performance of the Company’s internal audit function. Independent Auditors The Audit Committee is solely responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and termination of the Independent Auditors for the purpose of (i) preparing or issuing an audit report or related work, or (ii) performing other audit, review, or attest services for the Company. Oversight Oversight of the work of our Independent Auditors includes: • Review and approval of the planned scope of our annual audit. • Review of the Independent Auditors’ continued independence. • Review and pre-approval of any audit and non-audit services that may be performed by our Independent Auditors. • Review of the adequacy of our internal financial and disclosure controls with management and the Independent Auditors. • Review of our critical accounting policies and the application of accounting principles. • Reviewing the auditors’ report and critical audit matters presented by the Independent Auditors. • Monitoring the Independent Auditors’ rotation of partners on our audit engagement team as required by regulation. The Independent Auditors report directly to the Audit Committee. Appointment The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG to serve as our Independent Auditors and to perform an independent audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, as well as our internal controls over financial reporting, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”). The Audit Committee’s responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. In this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and KPMG regarding the fair and complete presentation of the Company’s financial results. The Audit Committee reviews the independence and quality control procedures of KPMG and the experience and qualifications of KPMG senior personnel that are providing audit services to the Company at least annually. In conducting its review of KPMG, the Audit Committee considers: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 16 • Historical and recent performance, including the results of an internal survey of KPMG’s service. • Quality and professional reputation, utilizing the questionnaire published by the Center for Audit Quality. • External data relating to audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on KPMG and its peer firms. • The value of KPMG’s services in relation to the fees charged to the Company. • KPMG’s tenure as our Independent Auditors and its familiarity with our global operations and businesses, accounting policies and practices and internal control over financial reporting. • KPMG’s capability and expertise in handling the breadth and complexity of our worldwide operations. • KPMG’s compliance with the partner rotation requirements established by the SEC. • KPMG’s integrity and objectivity. • KPMG’s independence from the Company consistent with PCAOB Rules, and the impact that any relationships or services may have on the objectivity and independence. The Company also annually confirms with each of its directors and executive officers whether there are any relationships that they are aware of with KPMG LLP that may impact the auditor independence evaluation. Based on this evaluation, including the factors discussed above, the Audit Committee has concluded that KPMG is independent and believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to retain KPMG to serve as our Independent Auditors for the 2024 fiscal year. The Audit Committee has also set clear hiring policies regarding the Company’s hiring of present or former employees of KPMG. Procedures for Handling Accounting Complaints The Audit Committee has established procedures for receipt and handling of potential complaints we may receive regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for the confidential, anonymous submission by our employees of concerns regarding accounting or auditing matters. In furtherance of this goal, we have established a confidential reporting system managed by an independent third-party vendor through which employees may report concerns about our business practices. The reporting system provides both a telephone hotline and online reporting options in multiple languages. Fees Paid to KPMG LLP The Audit Committee or its Chair approved all audit services provided by KPMG for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 prior to the work being performed. The total fees paid or payable to KPMG for the last two fiscal years are as follows: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 17 Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 Audit Fees $6,090,050 $5,290,720 Audit Related Fees $— $— Tax Fees $19,500 $20,000 All Other Fees $— $5,000 • Audit Fees include the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements, review of financial statements included in each of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by KPMG in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years. This category also includes audit related work for acquisitions and our ongoing adoption of new accounting standards. • Audit-Related Fees consist of fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements or that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor. • Tax Fees primarily relate to the preparation and review of federal, state, and international tax returns and assistance with tax audits. • All Other Fees include assurance services not related to the audit or review of our financial statements. Our Audit Committee determined that the rendering of non-audit services by KPMG was compatible with maintaining the independence of KPMG. Audit Committee Pre-Approval Procedures Under its charter, the Audit Committee must pre-approve the engagement of, and fees incurred by, KPMG LLP to perform audit and other services for the Company and its subsidiaries. The Audit Committee maintains a Pre-Approval Policy for this purpose. The Pre-Approval Policy designates the services which may be performed by the independent auditors and provides for advance approval of services and fees, consistent with SEC regulations regarding pre-approval of services. In some cases, pre-approval for a particular category or group of services and related fees may be provided by the Audit Committee for up to a year, subject to annually approved budget limits and regular management reporting. Management recommendations are considered in connection with such engagements, but management has no authority to approve engagements. In determining whether to grant pre-approval, the Audit Committee considers non-audit fees incurred to date as a percentage of total annual fees paid to KPMG LLP and the potential impact of KPMG LLP performing such services on auditor independence, including (i) whether the services are permitted under the rules and recommendations of the PCAOB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and Nasdaq, (ii) whether the proposed services are permitted under Cooper’s policies, and (iii) whether the proposed services are consistent with the principles of the SEC’s auditor independence rules. The Audit Committee considered and determined that fees for services other than audit and audit-related services paid to KPMG LLP during fiscal year 2023 are compatible with maintaining KPMG LLP’s independence. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 18 The Chair of the Audit Committee also has the delegated authority to pre-approve, on behalf of the full Audit Committee, engagements for  additional services and associated fees estimated to be below $150,000, provided that any such pre-approvals are reported to the Audit Committee at least quarterly. The Pre-Approval Policy also designates certain prohibited services for which the Company will not retain the Independent Auditors. Report of the Audit Committee The information contained in this report shall not be deemed filed with the SEC and is not incorporated by reference into any filing by Cooper under the Exchange Act. During fiscal year 2023, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the processes and procedures associated with our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. The Audit Committee also reviewed the quality and integrity of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, its compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of its independent registered public accounting firm, the performance of KPMG, and other significant financial matters. The Audit Committee met six times, including telephonic and/or videoconference meetings, during the 2023 fiscal year. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 with management and KPMG, and management represented to the Audit Committee that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed by the PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301 “Communication with Audit Committees” and received both the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG that are mandated by applicable requirements regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and the Audit Committee discussed KPMG’s independence from the Company with the lead engagement partner. Based on the review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 and be filed with the SEC.

Andrews Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer Daniel G. McBride Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer Holly R. Sheffield President, CooperSurgical, Inc. Gerard H. Warner III President, CooperVision, Inc. Fiscal 2023 Performance - The Year in Review Fiscal 2023 was an outstanding year for Cooper as we continued successfully executing on our long-term strategic objectives, including gaining market share, driving profitability, launching innovative products and services, and maintaining a fantastic culture. We posted record revenues of $3.59 billion, up 9% from prior year and 11% in constant currency, with CooperVision posting record revenues of $2.42 billion, up 8% from prior year and 11% in constant currency, and CooperSurgical posting record revenues of $1.17 billion, up 10% from prior year and 11% in constant currency. Major geopolitical events and risks presented notable headwinds for the year, but we successfully managed these challenges, including coping with inflation, ongoing supply chain difficulties, heightened foreign exchange volatility, and higher interest rates. With this performance, our stock price appreciated 14% in fiscal 2023. Within our business units, CooperVision’s record revenue performance included reporting an eleventh consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth to end the fiscal year. This led to market share gains and the strengthening of the company’s number two market share position in the global contact lens market in revenues, while becoming the leading global company in terms of wearers (based on internal estimates). CooperVision experienced global success with all geographic regions posting robust growth, and throughout its product portfolio, led by its silicone hydrogel portfolio of contact lenses. Product highlights included strong sales of daily silicone hydrogel lenses, led by MyDay®, continuing robust growth in the myopia management business, led by MiSight®, and ongoing success from the broad Biofinity portfolio of monthly silicone hydrogel lenses. CooperSurgical’s record annual revenues included its fertility business closing the year on a very strong note, with its twelfth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. In addition to the strong growth in fertility, CooperSurgical achieved market share gains around the world and throughout its product portfolio driven by a wide array of market-leading products and services. CooperSurgical’s medical device operations also managed through significant supply chain challenges and reported record revenues. During the 2023 fiscal year, we also continued investing heavily in key areas for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. We expanded our manufacturing footprints, improved distribution capabilities, and completed significant IT projects, all of which supported record revenues and position us well for continued growth. We completed important integration activity, including transitioning our specialty _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 24 lens care business into the core CooperVision franchise and advancing/completing numerous integration projects within CooperSurgical regarding our prior acquisition of Generate Life Sciences. We also invested considerable efforts enhancing our employee training and development activities. Our results for fiscal 2023 reflect the continuation of a multiyear effort to drive stronger sustainable, organic growth by investing in our people and our infrastructure including strengthening our supply chain management, sales and marketing teams, and research and development efforts to support continuing launches of new and innovative products. This investment activity resulted in a very successful 2023 and puts us in an excellent position entering fiscal 2024, and well into the future. 2023 Financial Highlights Budget Target FY2023 Results (Constant Currency) (1) FY2023 Results Change YoY (Constant Currency) (2) Revenue : $3.51 billion $3.60 billion $3.59 billion 11% CooperVision: $2.36 billion $2.43 billion $2.42 billion 11% CooperSurgical: $1.15 billion $1.17 billion $1.17 billion 11% Non-GAAP EPS: (3) $12.34 $13.02 $12.81 3% Stock Price (10/31/2023): $311.75 14% (1) Constant currency results used for consideration of achievement for annual cash incentive compensation reflect adjustments to foreign exchange rate used in connection with our annual budget.

This included expanding our employee development programs throughout the organization, including: ◦ The addition of a Mind & Body Well-being employee resource group (“ERG”) to our existing ERG programs providing resources to a variety of areas, including better access to mental health support. ◦ Launching new Inclusion & Diversity initiatives to support development of employees from underrepresented groups. ◦ Implementing tools to improve talent review and succession planning across all levels of the organization. • We also continued development of our ESG initiatives, as detailed in our ESG Report (which can be found on our website at https://www.coopercos.com/esg/). We encourage you to read the report for information regarding our ESG initiatives, including our continued efforts to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and initiatives to reduce plastic waste. Overall, we are proud of our successes during the 2023 fiscal year and our momentum entering fiscal 2024. The OCC took these efforts, and the resulting achievements, into consideration in its executive compensation decisions for fiscal 2023. 5 Year Trends _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 26 5 Year Trends Fiscal 2023 Compensation Highlights Our executive compensation program is designed to support our business and compensation objectives, and to reinforce our pay-for-performance culture through performance-based compensation that rewards achievement of our financial goals and positive stockholder outcomes. In fiscal 2023, our NEOs were eligible for a combination of annual cash bonuses under our 2023 Incentive Payment Plan (the “2023 IPP”) and long-term equity incentives provided as a combination of performance-based awards, granted as performance share awards ("PSUs"), and time-vested stock options and/or restricted stock units (“RSUs”) Approximately 92% of Mr. White’s target total direct compensation for fiscal 2023 was tied to financial and stockholder return outcomes, including 50% of total equity award value granted in the form of PSUs which only vest on achievement of financial performance over a three-year period. Approximately 84% of target total direct compensation for our other NEOs (on average) was tied to financial and/or stockholder return outcomes. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 27 Target Total Compensation Fiscal 2023 * “All Other Compensation,” as discussed in footnote 4 to the Summary Compensation Table represents less than 1% of total target direct compensation for our NEOs. Fiscal 2023 Incentive Payment Plan Result The 2023 IPP provides for annual cash incentives on achievement of designated quantitative financial metrics, representing 75% of the target bonus opportunity, and non-financial goals, representing 25% of the target bonus opportunity. The quantitative financial metrics selected for the 2023 IPP were revenue, and either non-GAAP EPS for the Company or operating income for CooperVision or CooperSurgical. All metrics are measured on a constant currency basis. Non-financial goals selected for the 2023 IPP included operational, organizational, and business goals not explicitly reflected in the quantitative financial metrics. These non-financial goals generally aligned with the objectives approved by the Board for Mr. White at the beginning of the fiscal year and determination of NEO achievement was dependent on the OCC’s assessment of executive performance against the designated goals. On review of the fiscal 2023 financial results and assessment of achievement against the designated non-financial goals, the OCC certified overall achievement of between 120% to 140% of target for each of the NEOs. This included the OCC’s determination that the NEOs had met the objectives set for the non-financial goals, resulting in achievement at 100% of target for the portion of annual bonuses based on those measures. This determination, including quantitative achievement, the approved non-financial goals, and considerations in setting NEO achievement, is discussed in more detail below. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 28 Fiscal 2021 PSU Result In December 2023, the OCC evaluated the performance results for PSUs that were granted in fiscal 2021 and eligible to be earned based on our 3-year non-GAAP EPS growth on a constant currency basis through the end of fiscal 2023. The OCC reviewed our financial performance over the three-year period and certified achievement of 14.8% compounded growth in non-GAAP constant currency EPS, which exceeded the maximum achievement goal. On that basis, the OCC confirmed achievement at 200% of target. This determination is discussed in more detail below. Consideration of 2022 Say-on-Pay Vote The OCC considered the outcome of our annual “Say-on-Pay” vote at our 2022 Annual Meeting in determining the design of our executive compensation program and the composition and levels of individual compensation packages for the 2023 fiscal year. At our 2022 Annual Meeting approximately 91% of the votes cast on our Say-on-Pay proposal were voted in favor of the compensation program for our NEOs. The OCC viewed this an indication of support for our NEO compensation in fiscal 2022 and considered this result in setting compensation for fiscal 2023 as described in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Consideration of 2023 Frequency of Say-on-Pay Vote At our 2023 Annual Meeting, our stockholders also voted on the frequency with which we will hold “Say-on-Pay” votes to approve the compensation of our NEOs and substantially all votes cast (99.3%) were in favor of presenting a Say-on-Pay vote every year. Accordingly, we are again holding a “Say-on-Pay” vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs at our 2024 Annual Meeting, and currently intend to hold additional “Say-on-Pay” votes to approve the compensation of our NEOs annually. Compensation Governance The OCC oversees our executive compensation program. In this capacity, the OCC regularly reviews our program to ensure that we maintain an effective and appropriate link between pay and performance and that our compensation practices do not encourage behaviors that could have adverse effects on the Company. The OCC seeks to ensure we maintain sound governance and compensation policies and practices. In designing and overseeing our executive compensation program we strive to employ best practices, and the OCC works closely with its compensation consultant, management, and such other advisors as the OCC considers appropriate to accurately assess our policies and practices. THINGS WE DO: THINGS WE DON’T DO: ✓ Entirely independent OCC ❖ No guaranteed annual salary increases ✓ Assessment by OCC of link between compensation and performance at least annually ❖ No guaranteed annual bonuses or long-term incentive awards ✓ Review by OCC of executive compensation program and individual compensation packages at least annually ❖ Prohibition on hedging and speculative transactions in Company securities by our officers and directors _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 29 THINGS WE DO: THINGS WE DON’T DO: ✓ Use of independent compensation consultants ❖ No supplemental executive retirement plan or other executive deferred compensation plans ✓ “Double-trigger” (change in control accompanied by an involuntary loss of employment) requirements for receipt of payments and benefits under employment agreements ❖ No related party transactions without approval from our Audit Committee ✓ Annual review of management succession planning process ❖ No repricing of long-term incentives without stockholder approval ✓ Robust stock ownership guidelines applicable to our executive officers ❖ No tax gross-ups for NEOs in connection with “change in control” payments ✓ Limited perquisites based on specific business rationale ✓ Compensation recovery (“clawback”) policy applicable to executive officer incentive compensation ✓ Exercise discretion to reduce annual cash incentive awards if determined necessary to ensure rigor required to earn incentive compensation The OCC also regularly assesses the alignment between our executive compensation packages and our performance through: • Regular updates from management on our business results, • Review of our quarterly financial statements, management projections, and long-range plans, • Review of management reports on continued progress on long-term strategies, • Review of performance and market information regarding our peer group, and • Review of broader industry compensation data relative to our market and other companies of comparable size. The OCC considers management input, the advice of its compensation consultant, and publicly available peer information to be valuable tools in evaluating the relationship between executive compensation and Company performance. Compensation Objectives / Pay for Performance Our executive compensation program is designed to provide market-competitive target total direct compensation opportunities for our NEOs based on a “pay for performance” philosophy and to align our NEOs’ interests with those of our stockholders by emphasizing certain principles: • Aligning compensation with performance by connecting executive compensation to financial measures that correlate strongly with stockholder returns, • Balancing short-term financial results with long-term strategic objectives, • Rewarding achievement of challenging corporate objectives, without encouraging inappropriate risk-taking, _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 30 • Providing competitive pay packages aligned to market compensation practices, and • Maintaining sufficient flexibility to allow recognition of significant individual achievements by our executive officers. The OCC believes that each element of executive compensation and the total compensation provided to each of our NEOs is reasonable, competitive, and appropriate. The OCC believes that our executive compensation program provides an appropriate mix of elements that will allow us to continue to attract, retain, and motivate a top-performing management team, without encouraging excessive or inappropriate risk-taking by our executive officers, and that our compensation arrangements create incentives that drive our continued strong financial performance. The compensation payable to our NEOs depends primarily on our financial performance and returns to our stockholders. This strategy has supported strong financial and operational results and we have maintained steady growth and returns for our stockholders over the past decade. We consider our executive compensation program design to be integral to our success and believe the performance measures selected for use in our incentive compensation plans serve as significant drivers of our continued success. Compensation Recovery Policy As part of the OCC’s pay for performance philosophy, the OCC has adopted a policy for recovery of incentive-based compensation in the event of misconduct by our NEOs (“Clawback Policy”). The Clawback Policy was amended in October 2023 to comply with the listing standards adopted by Nasdaq regarding compensation recovery, and the full policy is disclosed as an exhibit to our 2023 Annual Report. Under the policy, in the event we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement under securities laws, the Company will recover Incentive Compensation (as defined under the policy) received by current or former executive officers, including our NEOs, in the three fiscal years prior to the triggering event. Incentive Compensation includes compensation that was granted, earned, or vested based wholly, or in part, on attainment of one or more measures derived from our financial statements. The OCC administers the Clawback Policy and has authority to determine the amount of recoverable compensation and manner of recovery. Use of Compensation Consultants In fiscal 2023, the OCC retained Compensia to provide information and analysis on the compensation of our executive officers and the non-employee members of our Board. The OCC maintains sole authority to determine the terms of Compensia’s retention and services, and a representative of Compensia generally attends OCC meetings. The OCC has reviewed the nature of the relationship between itself and Compensia as an independent consulting firm, and its relationship with the members of Compensia as individuals, for potential conflicts of interest. In conducting this review, the OCC considered the factors identified by the SEC and Nasdaq as possibly contributing to conflicts, including the scope of work performed for the OCC by Compensia, the fees paid to Compensia for services, and any personal or business relationships between our executive officers or members of the OCC and Compensia or its individual members. Based on its _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 31 review, the OCC determined there were no conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest arising in connection with the OCC’s engagement of Compensia. Role of Management The OCC considers input from management regarding executive compensation and performance to be a valuable tool in setting appropriate compensation levels. In addition to recommendations regarding annual executive compensation, management also provides recommendations to the OCC regarding: • Selection of companies for our compensation peer group (as described further below), • Appropriate structure for our annual incentive payment plan, including financial performance measures, non-financial objectives, target performance levels, and calculation or determination of achievement levels, • Long-term incentive plan design and annual award allocations, • Employment terms and arrangements, and • Stock trading and incentive compensation recovery policies and ownership guidelines. The OCC reviews management recommendations with its compensation consultant before making its own decisions on the compensation of our NEOs. Compensation Peer Group The OCC uses a peer group for understanding and assessing competitive compensation levels and practices within our industry. Our compensation peer group is drawn from publicly traded companies headquartered in the United States and is reviewed annually. Recommendations for peer group companies are based on similarity of product lines or industry and similarity in company size as measured by annual revenue, market capitalization, operating margins, and other financial measures of organizational scope and complexity. For fiscal 2023, companies in Healthcare Equipment, Healthcare Supplies, and Life Sciences Tools and Services industries with comparable business focuses and end markets (generally healthcare supplies or equipment and hospital or health-care provider end markets) were considered for inclusion in our compensation peer group. Our peer group selection criteria also targeted revenues between about $1.5 billion and $6.1 billion in the previous fiscal year (about 0.5x to 2.0x our own revenue) and market capitalizations between about $5.3 billion and $52.6 billion (about 0.3x to 3.0x our own market capitalization). Our compensation peer group for fiscal 2023 comprised the following companies: Agilent Technologies, Inc. Illumina, Inc. Align Technology, Inc. Masimo Corporation Bausch + Lomb Corporation Revvity, Inc. (formerly PerkinElmer, Inc.) Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. ResMed Inc. Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. STERIS PLC DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Teleflex Incorporated DexCom, Inc. Waters Corporation Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Hologic, Inc. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 32 Compared to the above group, our revenue was in the 26th percentile and our market capitalization was in the 35th percentile at the time the peer group was approved. This group reflects updates from the peer group for fiscal 2022 as follows: Removed :    Hill-Rom Holdings. Inc. – was acquired during the year. Integra Lifesciences Holding Corporation – no longer meets criteria for peers. Added :        Bausch + Lomb Corporation – relevant business match within financial criteria Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. – relevant business match within financial criteria Compensation Decision-Making The OCC’s goal is generally to set all elements of NEO compensation within a competitive range, using a balanced approach that does not use rigid percentiles to target pay levels for each compensation element. For fiscal 2023, the OCC reviewed each element of compensation described below and set the target total direct compensation opportunities of our executive officers after taking into consideration the following factors: • A compensation analysis of competitive market data performed by Compensia, • Each executive officer’s scope of responsibilities, skill set, prior experience, and time in their position, • The recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer, and • General market conditions. The OCC does not assign relative weights or rankings to any of these factors and does not solely use any quantitative formula, target percentile, or multiple for establishing compensation among the executive officers or in relation to the competitive market data. Instead, the OCC relies upon its members’ knowledge and judgment in assessing the various qualitative and quantitative inputs it receives regarding each individual and makes compensation decisions accordingly. Executive Compensation The primary elements of our executive compensation program are designed to allow us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and to connect NEO compensation to stockholder returns and company objectives. Base Salary Provides a minimum level of competitive compensation for our executives Annual Cash Incentive Encourages achievement of short-term business goals as reflected in our annual operating budget Long-Term Equity Incentives Connects equity incentives to strategic objectives and priorities linked to long-term success, supports alignment between executives and stockholders, and encourages executive retention The majority of NEO compensation is a combination of annual cash and long-term equity incentives. This creates a direct link between our performance and NEO compensation. Additionally, compensation is _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 33 balanced between short-term and long-term factors to encourage attention to annual financial and operational objectives, and long-term strategic goals to drive long-term stockholder value creation. Annual target total direct compensation for our NEOs is based on current role, recent changes to responsibilities, and overall execution of duties throughout the prior fiscal year. Company performance, internal compensation alignment, peer group practices, and competitive market changes and conditions are also considered. Base Salaries We offer base salaries that are intended to provide a level of stable fixed compensation to our executive officers for performance of day-to-day services. Base salaries for our executive officers are generally reviewed annually to determine whether an adjustment is warranted or required, with any changes in base salary generally effective on the first day of our fiscal year. EXECUTIVE 2022 BASE SALARY (1) 2023 BASE SALARY (1) % CHANGE Albert G. White III $925,000 $1,080,000 16.8% Brian G. Andrews $550,000 $600,000 9.1% Daniel G. McBride $725,060 $750,000 3.4% Holly R. Sheffield $550,043 $575,000 4.5% Gerard H. Warner III $450,000 $500,000 11.1% (1) Salaries as presented here represent amounts approved by the OCC for the indicated fiscal year. Salary changes become effective on a calendar year basis and therefore amounts presented here may differ from the Summary Compensation Table which presents amounts actually paid. Salary changes for fiscal 2023 were structured to align executive compensation with similar roles from our peer group. This is consistent with the OCC’s overall philosophy regarding retention of key talent and maintaining stable leadership for the Company. Larger increases for certain executives, including our CEO, were approved in the context of salary levels that were meaningfully below the median of competitive market data provided by Compensia. Annual Cash Incentives – 2023 Incentive Payment Plan At the beginning of each fiscal year, the OCC approves an Incentive Payment Plan (“IPP”) to provide annual performance-based cash incentive opportunities. The OCC sets participation levels under the IPP (target incentive opportunities) for our NEOs. Each NEO’s annual incentive opportunity under the IPP is allocated into two components: • 75% of the target is tied to quantitative, pre-established financial performance metrics, and • 25% of the target is payable based on specified non-financial goals intended to recognize strategic, operational, and individual accomplishments. This combination of financial metrics and non-financial goals encourages our executive officers, including our NEOs, to focus on both our immediate business objectives and short-term financial performance, as well as other non-financial factors that support longer-term performance. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 34 Achievement levels for the quantitative financial performance metrics used in the IPP are based on targets in our annual operating budget, and achievement against the non-financial goals is based on the OCC’s assessment of individual performance by the NEOs. Target incentive opportunities under the IPP are calculated as a designated percentage of base salary for the fiscal year, and that percentage controls the potential award that can be achieved under the IPP as follows: Total Bonus Paid ($) = Base Salary ($) X IPP Participation Level (%) X Financial Metric and Non-Financial Goal Achievement (%) We have adopted a similar cash incentive plan for fiscal year 2024. Quantitative Financial Performance Component Quantitative financial performance measures and related target levels for the 2023 IPP were based on our annual operating budget, as approved by our Board at the beginning of fiscal 2023. Achievement for Messrs. White and Andrews was based on our overall revenue and non-GAAP EPS, adjusted for currency fluctuations. Achievement for Mr. Warner and Ms. Sheffield was based on revenue and operating income, adjusted for currency fluctuations, for each of CooperVision and CooperSurgical, respectively. Achievement for Mr. McBride was based equally on our overall revenue and non-GAAP EPS and on revenue and operating income achievement for CooperVision. Weighting for each of these financial metrics is described below under “Financial Objective Achievement.” The table below describes the relationship between how an award would be earned based on Company performance for each of the financial performance measures included in the 2023 IPP. No award would be payable with respect to any financial performance measure that did not reach its minimum achievement threshold. The maximum award for each NEO regarding any individual financial performance measure was capped at 200%. IPP Achievement Required to Attain Payout (1) Performance Measure Threshold Target Maximum Revenue (Constant Currency) 95% 100% 105% Non-GAAP EPS (Constant Currency) 90% 100% 110% Operating Income 90% 100% 110% (1) Potential payments at each of Threshold, Target and Maximum are presented in the Grants of Plan Based Awards Table . Target achievement provides for payout of 100% of target bonus amounts and maximum achievement is capped at 200% of the target bonus amount. Adjustments to Quantitative Financial Metrics and Achievement The 2023 IPP provides for adjustment to quantitative financial performance metrics for acquisitions and/or divestitures and other items during the fiscal year as determined by the Board. In making such adjustments, the OCC considers a report provided by management on variances to the budget goals for _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 35 revenue, operating income, and non-GAAP EPS that highlights key variances including non-recurring, non-controllable, and/or discretionary items. The OCC may elect to include or exclude certain of these items for purposes of determining the achievement against the financial metrics. The OCC also has discretionary authority to reduce, by up to 25%, the amount awarded based the financial metric component of the annual cash incentive, regardless of achievement levels, to the extent the OCC considers such reduction to be in the Company’s best interests based on any facts and circumstances. Award payments could also be reduced or wholly eliminated by the OCC if a review of the results for the first two months of fiscal 2024 reflected anomalous unfavorable events that were attributable to fiscal 2023. Non-Financial Performance Component Non-financial goals for the 2023 IPP were selected by the OCC at the beginning of fiscal 2023 to reflect operational, organizational, and business goals not directly reflected in the quantitative financial measures for the year. Achievement against the designated non-financial goals depended on the OCC’s assessment of individual performance by the NEOs against the agreed objectives, subject to a cap on maximum achievement at 200%. In determining achievement for the NEOs, the OCC considered Mr. White’s assessment of each NEOs performance against the selected objectives as well as the OCC’s own evaluation of such performance and recommendations from Compensia. Overall 2023 IPP Achievement Based on the OCC’s determination of achievement against the selected quantitative metrics and non-financial goals for fiscal 2023, the OCC approved the following awards for each NEO under the 2023 IPP. NEO Participation Level Financial Metrics Non-Financial Goals Award Payout (1) Target Bonus ($) (% of Base Salary) Weighted Achievement (2) Goal Weighting Weighted Achievement (2) Goal Weighting ($) (% of Target) (% of Base Salary) A.

For a reconciliation between reported GAAP and non-GAAP measures, see the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Non-Financial Objective Achievement The non-financial goals selected by the OCC in December 2022 for fiscal 2023 are summarized as follows: Category Goals Operational • Gain market share in contact lenses and fertility. • Further advance CooperVision's global myopia management business. • Complete strategic capital investment and expansion projects for CooperVision. • Complete key IT implementations for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. Organizational • Successfully transition key leadership roles and continue to advance executive development and succession planning. • Advance “OneCooper” initiatives to expand cross-division support and improve standardization and efficiency. Business • Complete strategic analysis of CooperSurgical business to support continued initiatives and return on investments. • Execute strategic M&A activity to support growth for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. • Continue advancing ESG initiatives. On review of performance for the year, the OCC determined that the NEOs had met or exceeded the non-financial goals and set achievement at 100% of target for the 25% of each NEO’s target incentive opportunity based on such goals. The OCC’s determination was based on its own assessment of the NEO’s accomplishments rather than a formulaic determination of achievement. In making its determination, the OCC considered numerous achievements against the non-financial objectives, including: Goals Key Achievements Operational: Market Share • CooperVision grew market share across all regions in revenue and wearers, including becoming the #1 contact lens company in the world in share of patients. • CooperSurgical gained market share in fertility on a global basis led by growth in consumables. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 38 Goals Key Achievements Myopia Management Business • The myopia management business grew 35% in constant currency with record revenues reported in all three regions, led by MiSight® growing 49% and orthokeratology products up 24%. • Substantially completed integration of our specialty eye care business into the core business. • Continued to advance research and development activities and supported adoption of standard of care guidelines for myopia management by professional organizations. • Increased distribution of MiSight® through expanding in key accounts and launching in new markets.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation For fiscal 2023, the OCC used a combination of time-vested and performance-based equity awards to deliver long-term incentive compensation to our NEOs. In setting equity compensation, the OCC discusses appropriate award design with Compensia and management to drive long-term focus on strategic objectives. The OCC also reviews historical grant levels based on the role and position of each NEO, as well as economic and accounting implications, when determining the type and appropriate size of individual awards. In setting award levels, the OCC considers market practices, management recommendations, and a competitive market analysis provided by Compensia. Equity awards are generally granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, after financial results for the prior fiscal year are available. Before the date of grant, each executive officer, including the NEOs, can choose to receive their time-vested award as stock options, RSUs, or a 50/50 combination of the two award types. The OCC retains the authority to set awards as it determines appropriate, regardless of such elections, but it believes that soliciting input from our executive officers enhances the retention value of long-term equity compensation. The OCC sets the grant value and type of awards granted to our NEOs based on an assessment of the value and type of awards granted by our peers and targets values to be competitive relative to comparable executive positions. Once the grant value is set, the number of shares underlying individual awards is determined based on the grant value, the stock price on the date of grant, and the accounting assumptions in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification Topic 718 (“ASC 718”). For fiscal 2023, stock options were valued at approximately 31.3% of the stock price on the date of grant. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 40 In setting award levels, the OCC considered competitive market practices and the recommendations provided by Compensia.

For a discussion of valuation assumptions, see Note 9, Stock Plans, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report. (2) Stock options granted in fiscal 2023 vest, in equal installments, over a four-year period starting on the first anniversary of the date of grant and have an exercise price of $329.83, which was equal to the closing trading price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. (3) RSUs granted in fiscal 2023 vest in equal annual installments on January 8, 2024, January 8, 2025, January 8, 2026 and January 8, 2027. (4) PSUs granted in fiscal 2023 have a 3-year performance period and will vest if designated targets are met at the end of fiscal 2025. Each performance share constitutes the right to be issued up to 2 shares of our common stock at maximum achievement. Awards granted are presented here at target number of shares to be awarded. Time-Vested Equity (Stock Options and RSUs) The OCC believes that time-vested equity awards have strong retention value while also creating a close link between executive compensation and stockholder gains. Time-vested equity awards granted to our executive officers, including our NEOs, are made in the form of stock options and/or RSUs. Stock options only have value to the recipient if we also have growth in our stock price, putting a portion of the executive officers’ compensation at risk of no return, and RSUs provide guaranteed value if the executive officer remains with the Company. Both award types provide the opportunity for long-term gain tied to stockholder returns while also encouraging longevity and stable management for the Company. Our time-vested equity awards generally vest annually in equal portions over a four-year period, but awards outside of the regular grant cycle or for special purposes may have different vesting. There were no out-of-cycle or special awards to NEOs in fiscal 2023. Performance-Based Equity (PSUs) In fiscal 2023, our NEOs received 50% of their total equity grant value in the form of performance-based equity awards, granted as PSUs. These awards are designed to reflect the direct influence of our NEOs on our long-term financial performance. The OCC has selected growth in compounded, adjusted EPS calculated on a constant currency basis over a three-year period as the performance measure for these awards due to its belief that this measure _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 41 provides a strong link to stockholder returns. Shares are released under these awards based on a sliding scale between 50% and 200% of target, assuming threshold achievement is met. Achievement below threshold will result in zero payout. The target number of shares to be received on vesting of PSUs is set based on the grant value of the award and the share price on the date of grant. In setting criteria for PSUs, the OCC considers our forecast performance. Target achievement levels are set to require significantly challenging, but attainable, results. These targets ensure that even achievement at the threshold levels for payout represents solid growth for the Company and stockholders. The OCC reviews these target achievement levels with Compensia to ensure that they are reasonable and appropriate. The OCC also considers the objectives for long-term growth set by our Board, the Company’s historical achievements, and the OCC’s goals for executive compensation. Achievement for Awards Granted in Fiscal 2021 PSUs granted to the NEOs (other than Mr. Warner) in fiscal 2021 completed their performance cycle at the end of fiscal 2023. Mr. Warner did not receive PSU award in fiscal 2021. These awards were eligible to be earned based on our 3-year non-GAAP EPS growth on a constant currency basis, as modified by the OCC for extraordinary, non-recurring, and/or unusual events. The OCC reviewed our financial performance over the three-year period and certified achievement of 14.8% compounded growth in non-GAAP EPS, which exceeded the maximum achievement goal of 11%. Additionally, the OCC decided to exercise its discretion to settle these awards in cash. Therefore, the NEOs will receive a cash payment equivalent to the value of 200% of the target number of shares under their awards as detailed below. Such payment shall be based on the average closing price of our common stock on the five trading days ending on February 2, 2024 and will be made on February 9, 2024. Achievement under 2021 PSUs (Performance Cycle: November 1, 2020 to October 31, 2023) Threshold (5% growth) Target (8% growth) Maximum (11% growth) Actual (14.8% growth) NEO Possible Shares Actual Shares A.

Sheffield 1,266 2,531 5,062 5,062 Employee Benefits & Perquisites Our NEOs are eligible to receive benefits under programs provided to our employees generally, including participation in our 401(k) plan (with matching contributions), benefits under our Retirement Income Plan (a defined benefit plan), and our health, life, and disability insurance programs, including contact lens benefits. Matching contributions to our 401(k) plan for the NEOs are equal to the matching contributions provided to employees generally, matching 50% of employee contributions up to $8,000 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 42 (for a maximum benefit of $4,000 per year). Benefits under the Retirement Income Plan are discussed in more detail in the Narrative to the Pension Benefits Table. Our NEOs also receive limited perquisites or other personal benefits, generally in the form of automobile allowances. In fiscal 2023, we also reimbursed expenses for each of Messrs. McBride and Warner in connection with spousal travel. We only provide perquisites or other personal benefits to our executive officers, including our NEOs, in situations where we believe it is appropriate to assist an individual in the performance of his or her duties, to make our executive officers more efficient and effective, and for recruitment and retention purposes. Executive Employment Agreements The OCC considers maintaining a stable and effective management team essential to protecting our, and our stockholders,’ best interests. Accordingly, the Company entered into employment agreements with each of the NEOs (other than Mr. Warner, who was not an NEO at the time) as of November 2018. The employment agreements provide for severance payments on termination of employment for specified reasons, including in connection with a change in control. These agreements provide severance benefits that the OCC has determined are competitive with market practice as well as double-trigger severance benefits for a termination in connection with a change in control, which is intended to encourage their continued attention, dedication, and continuity with respect to their roles and responsibilities without the distraction that may arise from the possibility or occurrence of a change in control of Cooper. Mr. Warner is eligible for change in control severance benefits under our Change in Control Severance Plan adopted on May 21, 2007. This plan provides for payments on termination of employment in connection with a change in control. Mr. Warner is subject to our standard practices regarding severance in the event of termination for reasons other than in connection with a change in control. All executive agreements and the Change in Control Severance Plan are discussed in more detail in the section titled Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control . Stock Ownership Guidelines We maintain stock ownership guidelines that require each of our executive officers to maintain a stock ownership level equal to a specific multiple of their annual base salary as set out below. There is no required period for the executive officers to achieve the required ownership. While ownership is below the set guideline the executive officers are expected to hold shares acquired from equity awards until the guidelines are met. In addition to directly held shares, the potential value of vested stock options and unvested RSUs are credited in consideration of whether ownership requirements have been met. As of October 31, 2023, all of our NEOs were in compliance with the applicable stock ownership guidelines. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 43 GUIDELINE (AS MULTIPLE OF BASE SALARY) 5x base salary – Chief Executive Officer Must hold 75% of the shares acquired from equity awards, net of taxes and any exercise cost, until guidelines are met. 2x base salary - Other Executive Officers Must hold 50% of the shares acquired from equity awards, net of taxes and any exercise cost, until guidelines are met. Tax Deductibility of Compensation The OCC considers ways to maintain tax deductibility of the compensation for our executive officers, however, the OCC has the discretion to approve, and it is likely that the Company will pay, compensation which will not be deductible under the Internal Revenue Code. Report of the Organization & Compensation Committee The Organization & Compensation Committee of the Board has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on this review and discussion, the OCC has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023.

(2) As of fiscal year end, Ms. Sheffield had not yet vested in her accrued benefits under the RIP. Narrative to Pension Benefits Table The RIP was adopted in December 1983. The majority of the Company’s U.S. employees who work at least 1,000 hours per year and were hired before August 1, 2019 are covered by the RIP. For services performed after December 31, 1988, participants accrue an annual retirement benefit equal to 0.60% of base annual compensation up to $10,000 and 1.20% of annual base compensation which exceeds $10,000 but is not in excess of the applicable annual maximum compensation permitted to be taken into account under Internal Revenue Service guidelines for each year of service. Further, current actively employed participants accrue an annual retirement benefit equal to 1.20% of base annual compensation up to the applicable annual maximum compensation for each year of service in excess of 35 Plan years of service. For service prior to January 1, 1989, participants accrued an annual retirement benefit equal to 0.75% of base annual compensation up to the Social Security Wage Base in effect that year and 1.50% of base annual compensation in excess of the Social Security Wage Base for each year of service. Based on the current accumulated benefits for the NEOs, the estimated annual benefits payable under the RIP upon retirement (at the RIP’s normal retirement age of 65) are as follows: Officer Estimated Annual Benefits Payable Albert G. White III $95,861 Brian G. Andrews $126,752 Daniel G. McBride $79,169 Holly R. Sheffield (1) $64,550 Gerard H. Warner III $59,484 (1) As of fiscal year end, Ms. Sheffield had not yet vested in her accrued benefits under the RIP. Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control The following table provides estimated payments to our NEOs if a covered termination of employment occurred on October 31, 2023. Values in the table include, as applicable: 1) cash severance; 2) annual bonus compensation payable under the 2023 IPP; 3) value of equity awards that would be exercisable and/or that would vest and be settled on a termination of employment; and 4) continued medical benefits. The value of accumulated benefits payable under the RIP, as shown in the Pension Benefits Table, are not included. Equity award value is calculated based on a price per share of $311.75, which was the closing price of our common stock on October 31, 2023. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 50 Termination without Cause / Resignation with Good Reason Termination without Cause / Resignation with Good Reason in connection with a Change in Control Death / Disability Albert G.

As permitted by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, for fiscal year 2023, we used the same median employee for the pay ratio as was used for the pay ratio in the Proxy Statement for fiscal year 2022. To identify the median employee, we evaluated the base salary of all employees globally (other than our Chief Executive Officer) as of October 31, 2022. We believe this measure most reasonably reflects the typical annual compensation of our employee population and was consistently applied for all employees. For employees paid other than in U.S. dollars, base salary amounts were converted from local currency to USD based on exchange rates on October 31, 2023. We did not exclude any non-U.S. employees under the de minimis or other exceptions set forth in Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, and we did not make any cost-of-living adjustments. Once the median employee was identified, we calculated the median employee’s total annual compensation in accordance with the requirements of the Summary Compensation Table. As calculated, we determined: • The annual total compensation of our median-paid employee for fiscal 2023 was $39,543. • The annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer for fiscal 2023 was $13,490,923 (as described above in the Summary Compensation Table). • The ratio of CEO compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee was 341:1. PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE Our executive compensation program is designed to support our business objectives and to provide market-competitive compensation based on a “pay for performance” philosophy that emphasizes achievement of financial goals and alignment with stockholder interests. Pay Versus Performance Table The following table provides disclosure for the indicated fiscal years regarding 1) the compensation paid to our Principal Executive Officer (“PEO”), and the average compensation of the other non-PEO NEOs (“Other NEOs"), as reported in the Summary Compensation Table (“SCT”), 2) the “compensation actually paid” (“CAP”) to our PEO and Other NEOs, 3) our company performance, and 4) the performance of our peers. The amounts provided are calculated pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K. The OCC does not utilize “compensation actually paid” as a basis for making compensation decisions. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 54 Fiscal Year SCT Total Compensation for PEO (1) Compensation Actually Paid to PEO (1) (3) Average SCT Total Compensation for Other NEOs (2) Average Compensation Actually Paid to Other NEOs (2) (3) Value of Initial Fixed $100 Investment Based On: Net Income (5) (in millions) Company Selected Measure: Total Stockholder Return (4) Peer Group Stockholder Return (4) Non-GAAP EPS (6) 2023 $ 13,490,923 $ 22,309,137 $ 3,462,463 $ 4,997,872 $ 97.77 $ 99.33 $ 294.2 $ 12.81 2022 $ 11,735,964 $( 9,232,263 ) $ 3,122,556 $( 1,008,290 ) $ 85.72 $ 102.28 $ 385.8 $ 12.42 2021 $ 10,994,906 $ 36,205,083 $ 2,772,601 $ 7,944,570 $ 130.69 $ 132.08 $ 2,944.7 $ 13.24 (1) Our PEO for all presented fiscal years was Albert G.

The CAP calculation for each year adjusts the compensation disclosed in the SCT to incorporate adjustments to the fair value of equity awards as detailed in the above Pay Versus Performance table and its footnotes. The CAP adjustment fluctuates due to changes in the Company's stock price in each of the years. The following graphs show the relationship between the CAP for our PEO and our Other NEOs and certain indicators of financial performance for Cooper for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

This compensation applies only to our non-employee directors. Members of the Board who are also our employees receive no additional compensation for their service as directors. The OCC reviews and recommends compensation amounts for our non-employee directors. The full Board approves compensation based on these recommendations. The OCC considers director responsibilities, compensation practices of our peer companies, and recommendations from Compensia in making non-employee director compensation recommendations to the Board. Compensation levels are reviewed at least annually and modified as the Board considers necessary or appropriate. Components of Director Compensation Cash Compensation In fiscal 2023, our non-employee directors received an annual retainer for their service. Additional annual retainers, in recognition of additional responsibility, were paid to the Chairman of the Board, the independent Lead Director, and the Chair of each committee of the Board. Annual Retainer: Chairman of the Board $175,000 Non-Executive Lead Director $70,000 All Other Non-Employee Directors $50,000 Additional Annual Retainer for Service as a Committee Chair: Audit Committee $25,000 Organization & Compensation Committee $20,000 Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee $15,000 Equity Compensation Our non-employee directors are eligible to receive annual equity awards in the form of RSUs under the Company’s 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan for non-employee directors (the “2020 Directors’ Plan”). Grants have a total grant date value of $270,000 (or $283,500 and $297,000 in the case of the Lead Director and Chairman, respectively) and are awarded annually on April 1st. If a non-employee director is appointed or elected after April 1st, then the director will receive a grant on the date of such appointment or election that is proportionally adjusted to reflect the number of months of actual service on the Board during the first fiscal year of their election or appointment. Awards vest in full on the first anniversary of the date of grant, except that if a director ends their term of service prior to the vesting date, the number of shares released under the award will be prorated according to the portion of the year actually served and the prorated number of shares will be released on the standard April 1 vesting date. If a director’s service were terminated prior to the vesting date for Cause, as defined in the 2020 Directors’ Plan, the director would immediately forfeit the award. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 58 Director Compensation Table The following table sets forth the total compensation paid to the non-employee directors for their service on the Board and its committees during the 2023 fiscal year.

Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast either for or against the nominee and therefore will not affect the outcome of the director elections. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 68 PROPOSAL 2 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Audit Committee has appointed the firm of KPMG LLP to act as our independent registered public accounting firm and to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2024. This appointment will continue at the pleasure of the Audit Committee and is presented to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good governance. If this appointment is not ratified by our stockholders, the Audit Committee will consider that fact when it selects our independent auditor for the following fiscal year. A representative of KPMG is expected to attend the Annual Meeting with an opportunity to make a statement and/or respond to appropriate questions from stockholders present at the Annual Meeting. KPMG has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 1982. The Audit Committee believes that KPMG’s tenure as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm provides distinct benefits, as KPMG has obtained significant knowledge and expertise in the Company’s global business operations, accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting. This knowledge: • Enhances audit quality and effectiveness and provides a framework for effective audit design and planning. • Enables efficiencies allowing cost effectiveness in fee negotiations. • Avoids disruption and additional education, and the substantial knowledge and familiarity required of a new auditor. In considering whether to reappoint KPMG, the Audit Committee considered: • KPMG’s qualifications and global capabilities, including its experience in our industry. • The results of the Audit Committee’s annual assessment of KPMG’s performance. • KPMG’s, and the audit engagement team’s, independence including whether the provision of non-audit services provided by KPMG, individually and in aggregate, to the Company during 2023 was compatible with their independence. • The quality, timeliness, and candor of KPMG’s communications with the Audit Committee and management. • The appropriateness of KPMG’s fees. • KPMG’s tenure as our independent registered public accounting firm. • The controls and processes in place that help ensure KPMG’s continued independence. • Any Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s firm inspection reports. • The potential impact of appointing a new independent registered public accounting firm. Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee believes that KPMG is independent, and its selection is in the best interests of the Company. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 69 The proposal to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2024 fiscal year requires an affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions will have the same practical effect as votes against this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect in determining the outcome of this proposal. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 70 PROPOSAL 3 — ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION We are requesting stockholder approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our NEOs as presented in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 24 and the compensation tables and associated narrative disclosure included in the discussion of executive compensation beginning on page 45. In addition to the annual review of our overall programs by our Organization & Compensation Committee (OCC), which is responsible for the design and administration of our executive compensation program, we have presented this advisory vote to our stockholders on an annual basis since 2011. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon us as a Company; however, the OCC values the opinions of our stockholders as expressed through your vote on this proposal. The OCC will consider the outcome of this vote in making future compensation decisions for our NEOs. Our executive compensation program has been designed to retain and incentivize a talented, motivated, and focused executive team by providing compensation that is competitive within our market. We believe that our executive compensation program provides an appropriate balance between salary and “at-risk” forms of incentive compensation, as well as a mix of incentives that encourage executive focus on both short-term and long-term goals as a company without encouraging inappropriate risks to achieve performance. Highlights of our Named Executive Officer compensation include: • Short-term and long-term incentives represent the majority of executive compensation, making actual compensation dependent on our performance as a company. • Short-term incentives require achievement of both quantitative financial goals tied to our operating budget and accomplishments against non-financial objectives approved by the OCC. • Half of the long-term, equity-based compensation awarded to our NEOs is granted in the form of performance share awards. • Agreements with our NEOs include a “double trigger” for any compensation on termination of employment resulting from a change in control. • We maintain Stock Ownership Guidelines for our executives, including a requirement that our Chief Executive Officer maintain stock ownership equivalent to at least five times his base salary. Accordingly, we will present the following resolution for vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders: “RESOLVED, that the stockholders of The Cooper Companies, Inc. (the “Company”) approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s NEOs as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table and related compensation tables and narrative disclosure as set forth in our Proxy Statement.” _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 71 The proposal to approve our Named Executive Officer’s compensation, on an advisory basis, requires an affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions will have the same practical effect as votes against this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect in determining the outcome of this proposal. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 72 OTHER MATTERS The Board knows of no other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting, but if any such matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is intended that the persons holding the accompanying proxy will vote in accordance with their best judgment. RECOMMENDATIONS The Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote: • FOR the election of eight directors to our Board as identified in this Proxy Statement. • FOR the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2024. • FOR the compensation of our NEOs as presented in this Proxy Statement, on an advisory basis. When a properly executed proxy in the form enclosed with this Proxy Statement is returned, the shares will be voted as indicated or, if no directions are indicated, the shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board.

The method of voting by proxy differs for shares held as a record holder and shares held in “street name.” If you hold your shares of common stock as a record holder you may vote your shares by following the instructions on the Notice, or by completing, dating, and signing the proxy card included with this Proxy Statement and _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 73 promptly returning it in the pre-addressed, postage paid envelope provided to you. If phone or internet voting is available to you, instructions are included in the Notice or on your proxy card. If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank, or other nominee, you will receive the proxy materials from your broker, bank, or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank, or other nominee may allow you to deliver your voting instructions by phone or through the internet. If you wish to vote your shares in person you may do so by attending the Annual Meeting and requesting a ballot. What happens if I vote my shares by proxy? When you return a completed proxy card, or vote your shares by telephone or internet, you authorize our officers listed on the proxy card to vote your shares on your behalf as you direct. If you sign and return a proxy card, but do not provide instructions on how to vote your shares, the designated officers will vote your shares on your behalf as recommended by the Board: • FOR the election of eight directors, as identified in this Proxy Statement, to serve for one year terms expiring at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders. • FOR ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2024. • FOR approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as presented in this Proxy Statement. Can I change or revoke my vote after I return my proxy card or voting instructions? If you choose to vote your shares by proxy, you may revoke or change your vote at any time prior to the casting of votes at the Annual Meeting. To revoke or change your vote, you may take any of the following actions: 1. Execute and submit a new proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card. 2. Submit new voting instructions through telephonic or internet voting, if available to you. 3. Notify Nicholas S. Khadder, Secretary of the Company, in writing that you wish to revoke your proxy; or 4. Vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting. Attending the Annual Meeting in person will not automatically revoke your proxy. How many votes must be present to hold the Annual Meeting? To conduct business and have a valid vote at the Annual Meeting a quorum must be present in person or represented by proxies. A quorum is defined as a majority of the shares outstanding on the Record Date and entitled to vote. In accordance with Delaware law and our Bylaws, broker “non-votes” and proxies reflecting abstentions will be considered present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 74 What are broker “non-votes”? Broker “non-votes” occur when a broker is not permitted to vote on behalf of shares it holds for a beneficial owner and the beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions. Shares held in a broker’s name may be voted by the broker, but only in accordance with the rules of Nasdaq. Under those rules, the broker must follow the instructions of the beneficial owner. If instructions are not provided, Nasdaq rules determine whether the broker may vote the shares based on its own judgment or if it is required to withhold its vote. This determination depends on the proposal being voted on. For the proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting, broker discretionary voting is only permitted for the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm. Will I have appraisal or similar dissenters’ rights in connection with the proposals being voted on at the Annual Meeting? No. You will not be entitled to appraisal or similar dissenters’ rights in connection with the proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. Other Q&A Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? The SEC permits us to provide our proxy materials electronically if you have not previously requested to receive only printed materials on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, on or about February 8, 2024, we mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. The Notice includes instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the internet or to request a printed copy. The Notice was sent to our stockholders of record as of January 24, 2024. All stockholders receiving the Notice can access the proxy materials electronically through the website referred to in the Notice, and they also have the option to request a printed set of the proxy materials. We encourage stockholders to take advantage of the availability of proxy materials on the internet. Can I vote my shares by filling out and returning the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials? No. The Notice only identifies the items to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. You cannot vote by marking the Notice and returning it. The Notice provides instructions on how to cast your vote. Who pays for the proxy solicitation and how will the Company solicit votes? We pay all costs associated with the solicitation of proxies, including any costs incurred by brokers and other fiduciaries to forward proxy solicitation materials to beneficial owners. We may solicit proxies in person or by mail, telephone, facsimile, or e-mail. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by any of our directors, officers, or employees. Additionally, we have retained the firm of D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist with the solicitation of proxies and will pay a fee of $17,500 for this service, plus reasonable costs and expenses. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 75 How can I communicate with the Board of Directors?
