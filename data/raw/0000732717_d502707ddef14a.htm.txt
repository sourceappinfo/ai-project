SUM2 2024 PROXY Table of Contents 2024 Proxy Statement Summary STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AT&T has a long history of engaging with our stockholders, reaching out to our investors each spring and fall to discuss an array of topics. We believe it is important for our governance process to have meaningful engagement with our stockholders and understand their perspectives on corporate governance, executive compensation, and other issues that are important to them. These engagements help to inform our Board’s approach to governance, compensation, and oversight of sustainability initiatives. The Company also provides online reports designed to increase transparency on issues of importance to our investors, including sustainability, diversity, political contributions and privacy, as well as the Proxy Statement and Annual Report. In the spring and fall of 2023, members of management and our Board Chairman, William Kennard, engaged with stockholders representing 29% of institutional shares outstanding on a variety of strategy, business performance and governance topics. Specifically, stockholders expressed interest in Board composition and how the collective skillset of our Board has evolved to support strategic priorities, and stockholders continued to express support for our approach to Board leadership and governance practices which promote independent Board oversight and management of risk. We also discussed our sustainability strategy’s alignment to business priorities and our executive compensation program and philosophy, which stockholders expressed continued support for. No further changes are anticipated for our 2024 compensation programs. • SCOPE OF OUTREACH IN 2023: We reached out to stockholders representing more than 34% of shares outstanding, or more than 60% of shares held by institutional investors. • SCOPE OF ENGAGEMENT IN 2023: In the spring and fall of 2023 we engaged with stockholders representing approximately 20% of shares outstanding, or approximately 46% of shares held by institutional investors who accepted our request for a meeting. 2024 PROXY SUM3 AT&T INC. Table of Contents 2024 Proxy Statement Summary SUSTAINABILITY HIGHLIGHTS The issues we manage under our Corporate Responsibility umbrella represent risks, opportunities and important external impacts we consider in our strategy and operations. Our approach is integrated into our business through Board of Directors oversight, officer-level leadership across relevant departments, and collaboration among dedicated teams of corporate responsibility professionals and subject-matter experts throughout the Company. Pages 31-35 detail how our integrated approach delivers long-term value for AT&T and positive social and environmental impact for our stakeholders. A sample of independent assessment organizations recognizing our approach and performance is provided on the inside back cover. SELECT HIGHLIGHTS: GOVERNANCE Board oversight (page 31) •  The Governance and Policy Committee (GPC) has direct oversight of environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy, related policies, programs and ESG reporting. Two other Board committees supplement ESG oversight as needed, the Audit Committee and the Human Resources Committee. Political engagement transparency (page 32) •  In 2023, our leadership in political engagement transparency was again recognized via independent third-party analysis. Additionally, we prepared and published our first Political Congruency Report, which provides insight into the congruency of votes made by recipients of political contributions from AT&T and from the AT&T Employee PACs with our Political and Corporate Sustainability Priorities. ENVIRONMENTAL Net zero emissions by 2035 (page 33) •  Through 2023, we are on track toward our science-based target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions 63% by the end of 2030, and our goal for net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by year-end 2035. Supplier and customer emissions reductions (page 34) •  Through 2023, we continued toward our Gigaton Goal to equip business customers with connectivity solutions that cumulatively avoid a gigaton of GHG emissions by the end of 2035. •  More than 50% of suppliers (by spend) have set their own science-based targets – achieving our supplier climate engagement target for the second consecutive year. Community resilience (page 33) •  In collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Argonne National Laboratory, we enhanced and grew awareness of the Climate Risk and Resilience Portal, which provides emergency managers and community leaders with critical climate data so they can better understand and address the future impacts of climate change. COMMUNITY IMPACT $2B commitment to address the digital divide (page 34) •  In 2023, we completed our $2B commitment to help close the digital divide. We also are on-track toward our 2025 goal to reach 1 million people through AT&T Connected Learning ® . Through the end of 2023 we launched 34 AT&T Connected Learning Centers ® in neighborhoods facing barriers to connectivity. We anticipate launching more than 50 total AT&T Connected Learning Centers by the end of 2024. •  We enabled more low-income households to access low-cost broadband service offerings with our Access from AT&T service and through participation in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC’s) Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). A welcoming and inclusive workforce (page 35) •  AT&T focuses efforts in three primary areas: 1) Diversifying our talent pipeline, 2) Enabling all talent to thrive, and 3) Strengthening our inclusive culture. To accomplish these goals, we regularly explore ways to tailor talent searches to attract a broader array of qualified applicants, provide key talent with opportunities and exposure to senior leaders, and develop our people leaders with inclusive leadership skills that help them build an ecosystem where all employees can feel a sense of belonging. AT&T INC. SUM4 2024 PROXY Table of Contents Proxy Statement GENERAL This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of AT&T Inc. (AT&T, the Company, or we) for use at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of AT&T. The meeting will be conducted virtually over the Internet at 3:30 p.m. Central time on Thursday, May 16, 2024. The purpose of the meeting is set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. This Proxy Statement and form of proxy are being sent or made available beginning April 4, 2024, to stockholders who were record holders of AT&T’s common stock, $1.00 par value per share, at the close of business on March 18, 2024. These materials are also available at www.envisionreports.com/att. Each share entitles the registered holder to one vote. As of March 18, 2024, there were 7,173,434,903 shares of AT&T common stock entitled to vote at the meeting. To constitute a quorum to conduct business at the meeting, stockholders representing at least 40% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote at the meeting must be present or represented by proxy. Each share of AT&T common stock represented at the Annual Meeting is entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the meeting. All matters, except as provided below, are determined by a majority of the votes cast, unless a greater number is required by law or our Certificate of Incorporation for the action proposed. A majority of votes cast means the number of votes cast “for” a matter exceeds the number of votes cast “against” such matter. If the proxy is submitted and no voting instructions are provided, the person or persons designated on the card will vote the shares for the election of the Board of Directors’ nominees and in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors on the other subjects listed on the proxy card and at their discretion on any other matter that may properly come before the meeting. The Board of Directors is not aware of any matters that will be presented at the meeting for action on the part of stockholders other than those described in this Proxy Statement. Election of Directors In the election of Directors, each Director is elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that Director’s election. Under our Bylaws, if a nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee is an existing Director standing for re-election (or incumbent Director), the Director must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board, subject to the Board’s acceptance. The Governance and Policy Committee will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Governance and Policy Committee’s recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the SEC, or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Governance and Policy Committee in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in making its decision may each consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. Any Director who tenders his or her resignation as described above will not participate in the recommendation of the Governance and Policy Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. If the number of persons nominated for election as Directors as of ten days before the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at such meeting shall exceed the number of Directors to be elected, then the Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. Because no persons other than the incumbent Directors have been nominated for election at the 2024 Annual Meeting, the majority vote provisions will apply. Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation The advisory vote on executive compensation is non-binding, and the preference of the stockholders will be determined by the choice receiving the greatest number of votes. All Other Matters to be Voted Upon All other matters at the 2024 Annual Meeting will be determined by a majority of the votes cast. Abstentions Except as noted above, shares represented by proxies marked “abstain” with respect to the proposals described on the proxy card and by proxies marked to deny discretionary authority on other matters will not be counted in determining the vote obtained on such matters. 2024 PROXY 1 AT&T INC. Table of Contents GENERAL Broker Non-Votes Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), on certain routine matters, brokers may, at their discretion, vote shares they hold in “street name” on behalf of beneficial owners who have not returned voting instructions to the brokers. On all other matters, brokers are prohibited from voting uninstructed shares. In instances where brokers are prohibited from exercising discretionary authority (so-called broker non-votes ), the shares they hold are not included in the vote totals. At the 2024 Annual Meeting, brokers will be prohibited from exercising discretionary authority with respect to each of the matters submitted other than the ratification of the auditors. As a result, for each of the matters upon which the brokers are prohibited from voting, the broker non-votes will have no effect on the results. VOTING Stockholders of Record Stockholders whose shares are registered in their name on the Company records (also known as “stockholders of record”) will receive either a proxy card by which they may indicate their voting instructions or a notice on how they may obtain a proxy. Instead of submitting a signed proxy card, stockholders may submit their proxies by telephone or through the Internet. Telephone and Internet proxies must be used in conjunction with, and will be subject to, the information and terms contained on the form of proxy. Similar procedures may also be available to stockholders who hold their shares through a broker, nominee, fiduciary or other custodian. All shares represented by proxies will be voted by one or more of the persons designated on the form of proxy in accordance with the stockholders’ directions. If the proxy card is signed and returned or the proxy is submitted by telephone or through the Internet without specific directions with respect to the matters to be acted upon, it will be treated as an instruction to vote such shares in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors. Any stockholder giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before the proxy is voted at the meeting by giving written notice of revocation to the Secretary of AT&T, by submitting a later-dated proxy, or by virtually attending the meeting and voting electronically. The Chairman of the Board will announce the closing of the polls during the Annual Meeting. Proxies must be received before the closing of the polls in order to be counted. Shares Held Through a Broker, Nominee, Fiduciary, or Other Custodian Where the stockholder is not the record holder (“Beneficial Stockholder”), such as where the shares are held through a broker, nominee, fiduciary or other custodian, the stockholder must provide voting instructions to the record holder of the shares in accordance with the record holder’s requirements in order to ensure the shares are properly voted. Beneficial Stockholders that attend the virtual meeting will be able to vote, change a prior vote, or ask questions. Shares Held on Your Behalf under Company Benefit Plans or under The DirectSERVICE Investment Program The proxy card, or a proxy submitted by telephone or through the Internet, will also serve as voting instructions to the plan administrator or trustee for any shares held on behalf of a participant under any of the following employee benefit plans: the AT&T Retirement Savings Plan; the AT&T Savings and Security Plan; the AT&T Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan; and the BellSouth Savings and Security Plan. Subject to the trustee’s fiduciary obligations, shares in each of the above employee benefit plans for which instructions are not received will not be voted. To allow sufficient time for voting by the trustees and/or administrators of the plans, your voting instructions must be received by May 13, 2024. In addition, the proxy card or a proxy submitted by telephone or through the Internet will constitute voting instructions to the plan administrator under The DirectSERVICE Investment Program sponsored and administered by Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (AT&T’s transfer agent) for shares held on behalf of plan participants. If a stockholder participates in the plans listed above and/or maintains stockholder accounts under more than one name (including minor differences in registration, such as with or without a middle initial), the stockholder may receive more than one set of proxy materials. To ensure that all shares are voted, please submit proxies for all of the shares you own. AT&T INC. 2 2024 PROXY Table of Contents VOTING ITEMS - MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS ITEM NO. 1 - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS Under our Bylaws, the Board of Directors has the authority to determine the size of the Board and to fill vacancies. Currently, the Board is comprised of eleven Directors, one of whom is an Executive Officer of AT&T. There are no vacancies on the Board. Under AT&T’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, a Director will not be nominated by the Board for re-election if the Director would be 75 or older at the time of the election. The Board of Directors has nominated the eleven persons listed below for election as Directors to one-year terms of office that would expire at the 2025 Annual Meeting. Each of the nominees is an incumbent Director of AT&T recommended for re-election by the Governance and Policy Committee. In making these nominations, the Board reviewed the background of the nominees (each nominee’s biography can be found beginning on the next page) and determined to nominate each of the current Directors for re-election. The Board believes that each nominee has valuable individual skills, attributes, and experiences that, taken together, provide us with the variety and depth of knowledge, judgment and vision necessary to provide effective oversight of a large and varied enterprise like AT&T. As indicated in the table below and in the following biographies, the nominees have exhibited significant leadership skills and extensive experience in a variety of fields, each of which the Board believes provides valuable knowledge about important elements of AT&T’s business. If one or more of the nominees should at the time of the meeting be unavailable or unable to serve as a Director, the shares represented by the proxies will be voted to elect the remaining nominees and any substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board. The Board knows of no reason why any of the nominees would be unavailable or unable to serve. The Board recommends you vote FOR each of the following candidates All Director nominees are independent, except for Mr. Stankey. 2024 PROXY 3 AT&T INC.

Table of Contents VOTING ITEMS - MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS ITEM NO. 2 - RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS This proposal would ratify the Audit Committee’s appointment of Ernst & Young LLP (EY) to serve as independent auditors of AT&T for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The Audit Committee’s decision to re-appoint our independent auditor was based on the following considerations: • quality and performance of the lead audit partner and the overall engagement team, • knowledge of the telecommunications industry and company operations, • global capabilities and technical expertise, • auditor independence and objectivity, and • the potential impact of rotating to another independent audit firm. The Audit Committee’s oversight of EY includes regular private sessions with EY, discussions about audit scope and business imperatives, and - as described above - a comprehensive annual evaluation to determine whether to re-engage EY. Considerations concerning auditor independence include: • Limits on non-audit services: The Audit Committee preapproves audit and permissible non-audit services provided by EY in accordance with AT&T’s pre-approval policy. • Audit partner rotation: EY rotates the lead audit partner and other partners on the engagement consistent with independence requirements. The Audit Committee oversees the selection of each new lead audit partner. • EY’s internal independence process: EY conducts periodic internal reviews of its audit and other work and assesses the adequacy of partners and other personnel working on the Company’s account. • Strong regulatory framework: EY, as an independent registered public accounting firm, is subject to PCAOB inspections, “Big 4” peer reviews and PCAOB and SEC oversight. Based on these considerations, the Audit Committee believes that the selection of Ernst & Young LLP is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Therefore, the Audit Committee recommends that stockholders ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP. If stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Committee will reconsider its decision. One or more members of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will be able to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. The Board recommends you vote FOR this proposal AT&T INC. 10 2024 PROXY Table of Contents VOTING ITEMS - MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS ITEM NO. 3 - ADVISORY APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION This proposal would approve the compensation of Executive Officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the accompanying narrative disclosures (see pages 39 through 70). These sections describe our executive compensation program. The Human Resources Committee is responsible for executive compensation and works to structure a balanced program that addresses the dynamic, global marketplace in which AT&T competes for talent. The compensation structure includes pay-for-performance and equity-based incentive programs and seeks to reward executives for attaining performance goals. AT&T submits this proposal to stockholders on an annual basis. While this is a non-binding, advisory vote, the Committee intends to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. AT&T is providing this vote as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act. GUIDING PAY PRINCIPLES Alignment with Stockholders Incorporate stockholder perspectives and feedback into any compensation program enhancements. Engage with stockholders as a key part of the Committee’s decision-making process and utilize compensation elements and set performance targets that closely align executives’ interests with those of stockholders. For example, approximately 67% of annual target pay for active NEOs is tied to stock price performance. In addition, we have executive stock ownership guidelines and stock holding requirements, as described on page 56. Each NEO is in compliance with AT&T’s common stock ownership guidelines. Competitive and Market Based Evaluate all components of our compensation and benefits program compared to appropriate peer company practices to ensure we are able to attract and retain world-class talent with the leadership abilities and experience necessary to develop and execute business strategies, obtain superior results, and build long-term stockholder value in an organization as large and complex as AT&T. Pay for Performance Tie a significant portion of compensation to stock price and/or the achievement of predetermined goals and recognize individual accomplishments that contribute to our success. For example, in 2023, 90% of the CEO’s target compensation (and an average, 89% for other active NEOs) was at risk and tied to short- and long-term performance incentives, including stock price performance. Balanced Short- and Long-Term Focus Ensure that the compensation program provides an appropriate balance between the achievement of short- and long-term performance objectives, with a clear emphasis on managing the sustainability of the business and mitigating risk. Principled Program Structure our program so that it aligns with both corporate governance best practices and our strategic objectives, while remaining easy to explain and communicate. The Board recommends you vote FOR this proposal 2024 PROXY 11 AT&T INC. Table of Contents VOTING ITEMS - STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS Certain stockholders, as noted below, have advised the Company that they intend to introduce at the 2024 Annual Meeting the proposals set forth below. The addresses of, and the number of shares owned by, each such stockholder will be provided upon request to the Office of the Corporate Secretary of AT&T at 208 S. Akard Street, Suite 2951, Dallas, Texas 75202. ITEM NO. 4 - Stockholder Proposal - Independent Board Chairman Kenneth Steiner proposes the following: Proposal 4 – Independent Board Chairman Shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt an enduring policy, and amend the governing documents as necessary in order that 2 separate people hold the office of the Chairman and the office of the CEO. Whenever possible, the Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent Director. The Board has the discretion to select a Temporary Chairman of the Board who is not an Independent Director to serve while the Board is seeking an Independent Chairman of the Board on an accelerated basis. Although it is a best practice to adopt this policy soon this policy could be phased in when there is a contract renewal for our current CEO or for the next CEO transition. The roles of Chairman and CEO are fundamentally different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent of the CEO and our company. This proposal is important to AT&T because the Board of Directors can repeatedly appoint one person to do the 2 most important jobs at AT&T, Chairman and CEO, for decades into the future. This proposal topic won 40% support at the 2020 AT&T annual meeting. It took much more AT&T shareholder conviction of the merits of this proposal topic to vote for the 2020 shareholder proposal, and thereby override the recommendation of the Board of Directors, than to simply go along with the AT&T Board of Directors recommendation. This 40%-support likely represented close to or more than 50%-support from professional investors who have access to independent proxy voting advice A Lead Director is no substitute for an independent Board Chairman. According to the 2022 AT&T annual meeting proxy the AT&T Lead Director has 4 primary duties some of which are shared with others. When the Lead Director shares roles with others it means that the Lead Director may need to do little or nothing in those roles in a given year. A new independent Board Chairman can focus more on developing the performance of the directors. For instance Glenn Hutchins, governance committee chair, was rejected by 17% of shares in 2023. Mr. Luis Ubiñas was rejected by 11% of shares in 2023. This compares to a 5% rejection often being the norm for well-performing directors. The ascending complexities of a company with $100 Billion in market capitalization, like AT&T, increasingly demand that 2 persons fill the 2 most important jobs at AT&T on an enduring basis – Chairman and CEO. It is time for a change since AT&T stock is down significantly from its $43 price in 1999. Please vote yes: Independent Board Chairman—Proposal 4 AT&T INC. 12 2024 PROXY Table of Contents VOTING ITEMS - STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS BOARD RESPONSE: The Board is committed to independent Board leadership and has had an Independent Chair in place since 2021. The Board does not anticipate any changes to its current leadership structure, which it believes is consistent with other S&P 500 companies and supported by AT&T’s stockholders, and recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this inflexible, one-size fits all, proposal that seeks to influence the decisions of future Boards regardless of the circumstances relevant to the Company at that time. Our Board currently has an Independent Chair, and our governance structure promotes strong independent Board leadership. The AT&T Board currently has an Independent Chair and has since 2021 when Bill Kennard began serving in that role. The Board has determined that such a leadership structure is the most appropriate for our Company at this time and believes that Mr. Kennard’s expertise in the global communications industry and knowledge of our complex regulatory landscape enable him to effectively serve in this role. While the Board’s current practice is to elect an Independent Chair, its Directors have a fiduciary duty to regularly evaluate and determine the most appropriate Board leadership structure for AT&T and our stockholders, considering the Company’s needs, circumstances, and opportunities. Moreover, the Board is firmly committed to independent Board leadership, and in situations where the Chair of the Board is not independent, our Company policies require the appointment of an independent Lead Director, to be elected by the independent Directors at the time, with robust and clearly defined responsibilities as detailed further below. The Board believes that its current structure with an Independent Chair, and its system of appointing an independent Lead Director in the event the Chair is not independent, provides effective oversight of management. The Board maintains strong, independent oversight on behalf of stockholders by consistently ensuring that each Board committee is led by and composed entirely of independent Directors, and we maintain strong corporate governance practices, as described in more detail beginning on page 20 of this proxy. Additionally, according to the 2023 Spencer Stuart Board Index, less than 40% of S&P 500 companies have an independent chair in place and, based on information collected by an independent, third-party advisor, only 3% of S&P 500 companies have a codified policy in their corporate governance guidelines requiring that the chair of the board be independent. Maintaining flexibility in approach is in the best interest of AT&T and its stockholders. The Board believes continued flexibility to appoint the appropriate Board leadership is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Given the large and complex nature of our business and the challenges of operating in a highly regulated industry, a policy requiring an independent chair would unnecessarily restrict the ability of Directors in structuring AT&T’s Board leadership when faced with new or different circumstances. The rigid standard imposed by this proposal does not allow the Board flexibility to select the leadership structure best suited to meet the needs of the Company and prioritize the interests of its stockholders based on the particular environment, circumstances, and challenges confronting the Board and the Company at any given time. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide for the appointment of an independent Lead Director with robust and clearly defined responsibilities in the event that the Chair is not independent. Should the best interests of the Company and its stockholders warrant the appointment of a Chair who is not independent, in compliance with existing policies, the independent Directors of the Board would simultaneously appoint an independent Lead Director with clearly delineated and comprehensive responsibilities including – among others – presiding at Board meetings at which the Chair is not present, acting as the principal liaison between management and non-management Directors, and acting as a contact for major stockholders and other interested persons. The Board believes that in the event the Chair is not independent this structure would serve as an appropriate counterbalance, promoting consistent independent Board oversight, and providing for clearly established leadership roles on the Board. The full list of Lead Director responsibilities is detailed on page 4 of the AT&T Corporate Governance Guidelines at investors.att.com. 2024 PROXY 13 AT&T INC. Table of Contents VOTING ITEMS - STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS Through our long-standing stockholder engagement program, we have received consistent support for the Board’s flexible approach, including during our most recent leadership transition. We regularly discuss our leadership structure with stockholders as part of our annual engagement program; stockholders continue to express support for our flexible approach to Board leadership and our governance practices which promote independent Board oversight of management, including throughout leadership transitions. In our most recent stockholder outreach in the fall of 2023, we prioritized this topic in our discussions with stockholders. We continued to hear strong support for our current Board leadership structure, flexibility for the Board to evolve the leadership structure if it determines it is necessary, and appreciation for a robust and clearly defined independent Lead Director role in the event of a non-independent Chair. Additionally, similar stockholder proposals have been presented at six of the last eight annual meetings, and our stockholders have voted against the proposal each time. For these reasons, the Board believes that the rigid approach to the Company’s leadership structure requested by the proposal is not necessary and not in the best interest of our stockholders. The Board has a demonstrated commitment to independent Board leadership and believes it is best positioned to determine the most effective leadership structure for the Company in consideration of the relevant circumstances facing the Company at any given time. The Board recommends you vote AGAINST this proposal. ITEM NO. 5 - Stockholder Proposal - Improve Clawback Policy for Unearned Pay for Each NEO John Chevedden proposes the following: Proposal 5 – Improve Clawback Policy for Unearned Pay for Each NEO Shareholders ask the Board of Directors to amend the Company Policy on recoupment of incentive pay to apply to the each Named Executive Officer and to state that conduct or negligence – not merely serious misconduct – may trigger application of that policy. Also the Board is to report to shareholders in an EDGAR filing the results of any deliberations about whether or not to cancel or seek recoupment of compensation paid, granted or awarded to NEOs. These amendments should operate prospectively and be implemented so as not to violate any contract, compensation plan, law or regulation. This includes that at the time of the amendment that no section of such revised policy be adopted that would act against this proposal and make it more difficult to clawback unearned NEO pay and that no section of such revised policy shall further restrict the current policy. The current AT&T policy applies only to knowing fraudulent or illegal conduct. The current AT&T policy requires no report to shareholders. Because the AT&T clawback policy is limited to knowing fraudulent or illegal conduct and does not require disclosure to shareholders, that policy is too narrow, too vague, and does not address situations where an executive fails to exercise oversight responsibilities that result in significant financial or reputational damage to AT&T. It should. A clawback policy based on conduct – not serious misconduct is consistent with a 2022 rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission that requires a clawback of erroneously awarded incentive pay – even with no misconduct – if a company restates its financial statements owing to material errors. There are only 50-words in the 2023 AT&T annual meeting proxy under the heading of Clawback Policy and there is no listing of the web address for the complete AT&T Clawback Policy. Wells Fargo offers a prime example of why AT&T needs a stronger policy. After 2016 Congressional hearings, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million to resolve claims of fraudulent sales practices. Wells Fargo’s board then moved to claw back $136 million from 2 top executives. Wells Fargo unfortunately concluded that the CEO had only turned a blind eye to the practice of opening fraudulent accounts. Please vote yes: Improve Clawback Policy for Unearned Pay for Each NEO—Proposal 5 AT&T INC. 14 2024 PROXY Table of Contents VOTING ITEMS - STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS BOARD RESPONSE: The proposal ignores AT&T’s existing policies regarding the recovery of employee compensation which, in certain respects, are even more comprehensive than what the proposal requests. The Board recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: • AT&T recently adopted a Clawback Policy 1 in compliance with SEC rules and NYSE standards, and conducted a thorough review to ensure the policy best protects stockholder interests and adequately discourages excessive risk-taking by executives. • Additionally, AT&T has long had protections on employee compensation that extend beyond the terms of the Clawback Policy. Specifically, since 2009, AT&T’s Policy on Restitution 2 has permitted the Company to seek restitution of any bonus, commission, or other compensation received by any employee as a result of fraudulent or illegal conduct, regardless of whether a restatement of the Company’s financial statements is required. • AT&T’s policies and SEC rules already require disclosure of information about the application of these policies. • AT&T’s policies provide the Board with appropriate guidance, authority, and discretion to seek recoupment of incentive-based compensation when such action is warranted and to act in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Furthermore, the Company’s policies protect the interests of its stockholders and promote transparency and management accountability. We crafted our Clawback Policy to be comprehensive in nature and in compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Effective October 2, 2023, we adopted our new Clawback Policy, which addresses SEC rules and NYSE listing standards requiring companies to adopt, disclose and enforce a clawback policy providing for the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received by current and former executive officers in connection with a financial restatement, regardless of fault or misconduct. Our Clawback Policy applies to all incentive-based compensation received by covered executives of the Company regardless of fault or misconduct “in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws.” In this respect, the Clawback Policy has a no-fault standard, which is an even lower standard than the proposal’s requested standard of “conduct or negligence.” Under the Clawback Policy, the Board does not need to determine that a covered executive of the Company was negligent or acted (or omitted to act) in any way at all for the policy to apply. If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, the Clawback Policy is automatically triggered, and the Company must “recover reasonably promptly the amount of erroneously awarded” incentive-based compensation from any covered executives of the Company who received such compensation during the covered period. By adopting the Clawback Policy, we specifically intended to comply with the new NYSE listing requirement. Notably, the proposal acknowledges that the policy it requests is consistent with that clawback policy listing requirement. The proposal thus would not provide stockholders with any meaningful protection or benefit beyond what our Clawback Policy already provides. We maintain a Policy on Restitution, which includes additional parameters that extend beyond the proposal’s ask. Our Policy on Restitution allows the Board to “seek restitution of any bonus, commission, or other compensation received by any employee as a result of the employee’s intentional or knowing fraudulent or illegal conduct, including the making of a material misrepresentation contained in the Company’s financial statements.” Unlike the policy requested by the proposal, the Policy on Restitution is not limited to incentive-based compensation received by Named Executive Officers of the Company but applies to all employees and to other forms of compensation, as well. Because the scope of the Policy on Restitution is broad, the Board believes it is appropriate to limit its application to circumstances involving misconduct. The proposal does not discuss specific circumstances, events, actions, or outcomes that trigger the application of the requested policy. As a result, the Board believes that the proposal lacks the appropriate guidelines to direct its application. 1 Available at https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR-V2/governance-documents/att-clawback-policy. pdf. 2 Available at https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR-V2/governance-documents/policy-on-restitution. pdf. 2024 PROXY 15 AT&T INC. Table of Contents VOTING ITEMS - STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS We disclose our full Clawback Policy and Policy on Restitution on our company website, and details surrounding their application are disclosed in a Form 8-K, as required, which is accessible to all stakeholders. The proposal claims that the “AT&T clawback policy does not require disclosure for shareholders”; however, the Company is required to disclose information about the application of these policies in its SEC filings and complies with these requirements. The Clawback Policy requires the Company to disclose not only the Board’s determination that the policy applies, as in the proposal’s request, but also the basis for any conclusion by the Board that an exception under the policy is warranted and detailed information about the amounts subject to recoupment. To the extent the Company were to recoup material compensation paid to a Named Executive Officer pursuant to the Policy on Restitution, disclosure would be required in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC. The Board believes that the Company’s Clawback Policy and Policy on Restitution provide the Board with appropriate guidance, authority, and discretion to seek recoupment of incentive-based compensation in circumstances when such action is warranted and to act in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Furthermore, the Company’s policies protect stockholders’ interests, and promote transparency and management accountability. The Board recommends you vote AGAINST this proposal. ITEM NO. 6 - Stockholder Proposal - Report on Respecting Workforce Civil Liberties The National Center for Public Policy Research proposes the following: Report on Respecting Workforce Civil Liberties Supporting Statement: AT&T (Company) employs more than 160,000 people. 1 It should respect its employees’ speech rights and religious freedom. Company legally must comply with many laws prohibiting discrimination against employees on many grounds, including religion and sometimes political affiliation. Respecting diverse views and beliefs allows Company to attract the most qualified talent, promote a healthy and innovative business culture, and contribute to a healthy economic market and marketplace of ideas. Despite this, the Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index (2023) (VDSBI) 1 found rampant corporate discrimination by religion, viewpoint and other characteristics, and that 78% of scored companies discriminated against religious nonprofits, and 63% supported legislation undermining fundamental First Amendment freedoms. AT&T scored only 10 percent on the VDSBI, in part because it reserves the right to deny service to customers who express views opposed by AT&T executives, pressures stakeholders to discriminate as those executives wish, and supports legislation that would roll back longstanding statutory protections of religious liberty. 2 AT&T actively supports the “Equality Act,” which would repeal viewpoint protections while forcing American life into alignment with fringe theories that harm, among others, women, girls and small children 3 Likewise, it opposed common-sense voting-integrity provisions that most Americans of all surface-characteristic categories support. 4 These unnecessary, divisive stances alienate many current and potential employees and other stakeholders. 1 https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/t/employees/ 2 https://www.viewpointdiversityscore.org/company/att 3 https://www.hrc.org/resources/business-coalition-for-equality; https://www.realclearreligion.org/articles/2019/05/16/the_equality_act_will_hurt_religious_freedom_110219.html 4 https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dell-american-airlines-att-weigh-restrictive-voting-bills/story?id=76809993; https://news.yahoo.com/poll-majority-dems-non-white-194529851.html AT&T INC. 16 2024 PROXY Table of Contents VOTING ITEMS - STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS The business dangers of viewpoint conformity are clear. Company bottom-lines, and thus shareholder value, decrease when ideological lockstep makes the risks of hyperpartisan behavior invisible. Bud Light revenue fell $395 million in North America in a year because it took a hard partisan position on hot-button political and social issues. 5 Target’s market cap fell over $15 billion for parallel reasons. 6 And Disney stock fell 44 percent in 2022 – its worst performance in nearly 50 years – amid its decision to pursue extreme partisan agendas. 7 Meanwhile, companies’ potential liability for discrimination was sharpened by the recent Supreme Court decisions in Students for Fair Admission v. Harvard and Groff v DeJoy . The Company must act now to assess and correct potential shortcomings. Corporations have recently lost such illegal discrimination actions, paying $10 to $25 million in damages, plus litigation costs. The risk of these suits is rising. AT&T has a proven record of discrimination on illegal grounds and of active campaigns against religious liberty. 8 With more than 160,000 employees, Company could face thousands of religious and other discrimination cases if it doesn’t correct course, putting billions of shareholder assets at risk. Resolved : Shareholders request the Board of Directors conduct an evaluation and issue a report within the next year, at reasonable cost and excluding proprietary information and disclosure of anything that would constitute an admission of pending litigation, evaluating how AT&T’s policies and practices impact employees and prospective employees based on their religion (including religious views) or political, social and environmental view, and the risks those impacts present to Company’s business. 5 https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/business/anheuser-busch-revenue-bud-light-intl-hnk/index.html; 6 https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/target-market-cap-losses-hit-15-7-billion-share-near-52-week-low-amid-woke-backlash 7 https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/disney-has-lost-50-billion-in-value-since-war-with-florida-began; https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-stock-2022-1235289239/; https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/disney-stock-price-decline-bob-iger-pandemic-inflation-recession-streaming-2022-12; https://www.foxnews.com/media/disneys-decline-shows-woke-focus-alienating-fans-wsj-column 8 https://www.city-journal.org/article/white-people-you-are-the-problem BOARD RESPONSE: The proponent’s comments about AT&T’s policies, practices and advocacy misrepresent our commitment to equality and anti-discrimination, and the proponent is seeking a report which would be duplicative of AT&T’s existing disclosures. The Board recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: • AT&T is committed to respecting the rights and viewpoints of all stakeholders on various issues, including its employees and customers. AT&T’s practices are governed by its Human Rights Policy, 1 Code of Business Conduct, 2 Equal Employment Opportunity & Harassment Policy 3 and Principles of Conduct for Suppliers, 4 which prohibit discrimination on the basis of all characteristics protected by law. • AT&T already provides robust disclosure on how its policies and practices reinforce an inclusive workforce and equitable recruiting and hiring processes, as well as its anti-discrimination initiatives. AT&T regularly discloses its efforts through its annual Sustainability Summary, DE&I Report and its DE&I-specific Issue Brief, which are all published externally on its Sustainability and DE&I webpages. 5 • AT&T’s approach to maintaining an inclusive and equitable culture that respects all viewpoints is codified at the Board level, through the Governance and Policy Committee’s oversight of corporate responsibility matters, including diversity, and of the Company’s brand health and reputation. 1 Available at https://about.att.com/ecms/dam/csr/2023/Policies/Human_Rights_Policy.pdf. 2 Available at https://cobc.att.com/workplace. 3 Available at https://about.att.com/ecms/dam/csr/2019/governance/Equal-Employment-Opportunity.pdf. 4 Available at https://attsuppliers.com/misc/SupplierSustainabilityPrinciples.pdf. 5 Available at https://sustainability.att.com/ and https://about.att.com/pages/diversity. 2024 PROXY 17 AT&T INC. Table of Contents VOTING ITEMS - STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS • AT&T is acting in the best interest of stockholders through its established practices; AT&T believes when its employees succeed, the Company does better. Implementing this proposal would be costly and not in the best interest of stockholders given AT&T already devotes substantial resources to developing and managing high-impact DE&I programs that equally support employees of all kinds, including various races, genders, religious beliefs and ideologies, provides transparency about such efforts, and regularly reports on its progress. We take an affirmative stance in support of equality, including free speech and religious freedom, and against discrimination. Standing for equality aligns with our Company Purpose of connecting people to greater possibility. Our publicly disclosed policies and our robust practices reflect this commitment. We reached out to the proponent and engaged in a lengthy discussion about the commitment we have to respecting human rights and providing a fully fair and equitable workforce for all. After listening to the proponent, we reviewed our policies and public statements and will be making adjustments to clarify, ensure consistency and reinforce our commitment to equitable policies for all employees. While the proponent appreciated this action, absent a commitment to participate in the survey referenced in the shareholder proposal, an agreement could not be reached. We believe that the freedom to access information, the freedom to communicate and respect for privacy are essential to the advancement of human potential. At its most basic level, the infrastructure we build and operate is part of a global platform which enables the ability to connect and communicate. Through our services and platforms, we make it possible for our users to hold and share opinions freely, to seek out the ideas of others and to communicate their own. This exchange of information and ideas is at the very core of what we do as a company. We respect and protect the freedom of expression of our users. We promote the right of our users to hold and freely share opinions without interference, and to access the full range of ideas and information. We seek to protect our users, particularly children, from harmful content by providing tools and information, and by working with those dedicated to online safety. We believe restrictions on freedom of expression using communications services and the internet diminish their usefulness, dampen the exchange of ideas, and reduce innovation and commercial opportunities. We maintain codified policies that prohibit discrimination of any kind across all stakeholders, and that protect workforce civil liberties. Our Human Rights Policy codifies our approach to equality in the workplace. As an employer, we strive to be a preferred place to work, to be respectful and supportive of our workforce, and to provide an inclusive culture. We believe the differing viewpoints that we each bring to the workplace challenge us collectively to think more broadly and allow us to better serve our customers. We realize that the world we serve is diverse in its social customs and cultural traditions, and we respect and embrace those differences. We seek to live up to the highest standards of ethics, integrity and responsibility in our own operations, with our suppliers, and for all the customers we serve. Further, both our Code of Business Conduct and Equal Employment Opportunity & Harassment Policy make clear that our Company does not permit discrimination, intimidation or harassment. As written, AT&T employees are protected from discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, religious creed, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, physical disability, mental disability, pregnancy, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, citizenship status, military status, veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law. We believe that when the actions of some cause others to feel intimidated, offended, or to lose dignity, all of us suffer. We insist on a positive work environment and to speak out if that goal is compromised by anyone. AT&T INC. 18 2024 PROXY Table of Contents VOTING ITEMS - STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS We transparently and regularly disclose our efforts to promote an environment of equality and inclusion for all. Our approach to DE&I puts our employees and their experiences at the heart of our inclusive culture, valuing and celebrating the diversity of their backgrounds, viewpoints and abilities. We work to create an environment of inclusion in our workforce, including through our Equality First platform which provides employees with free access to an immersive hub of content and hands-on tools focused on building inclusive leadership practices. The platform offers learning techniques to improve communication to broader audiences; sharpen employees’ ability to recognize and counteract how bias impacts their teams’ work and relationships; upskill in assessing team members’ contributions through the lenses of inclusion and equity; and gain expertise to more consciously and comfortably build diverse teams. We prioritize recruiting and hiring talented people who reflect the world in which we live and we also invest in skills development programs for our people throughout their careers. We maintain an award-winning internal training organization, AT&T Learning & Development, that engages our team with training, mentoring and career development programs. Our programs allow our employees to foster achievement based on individual merits and abilities without regard to sex, race, age, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, religion, protected veteran status, employment status or other protected statuses. We also support the Business Coalition for the Equality Act and the United Nations Standards of Conduct for Business, which offer a holistic framework of best practices to help combat discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Contrary to the claim that the Equality Act drives divisiveness and alienation among current and potential employees, these coalitions serve to promote inclusion of all groups among AT&T’s workforce and do not infringe on the rights of any employees to freedom of expression and respect. We transparently disclose our efforts, progress and impact on our workforce through our DE&I website, which includes our Sustainability Summary, Priority Topics and Progress Toward Goals. The Governance and Policy Committee of our Board provides robust oversight of our corporate responsibility programs, including issues related to diversity, privacy and public policy impacting our stockholders, employees, customers, and communities. We believe the report requested by this proposal is redundant and not in stockholders’ best interest. Our commitment to equity and preventing discrimination starts at the top, with oversight from the Board of Directors and direct guidance from the Governance and Policy Committee. The Committee is regularly updated on key DE&I topics and engages in strategic discussions with both AT&T’s Senior Vice President – Sustainability, Corporate Responsibility and ESG, as well as the Chief Diversity Officer. The Committee reviews AT&T’s corporate policies and practices and is responsible for determining how Company practices impact public expectations, including those related to equity and inclusion, and for providing guidance and perspective to the full Board and management on these issues. We agree with the proponent’s assertion that respecting diverse views and beliefs allows our Company to attract the most qualified talent, promote a healthy and innovative business culture, and contribute to a healthy economic market. However, we believe that the disclosed policies and practices we already have in place effectively safeguard our workforce’s civil liberties, making the report requested by this proposal redundant and not in the best interests of stockholders. The Board recommends you vote AGAINST this proposal. 2024 PROXY 19 AT&T INC. Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT&T is committed to strong corporate governance principles. Effective governance protects the long-term interests of our stockholders, promotes public trust in AT&T, and strengthens management accountability. AT&T regularly reviews and updates its corporate governance practices to reflect evolving corporate governance principles and concerns identified by stockholders and other stakeholders. The Role of the Board The Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of management and strategic direction and for establishing broad corporate policies. In addition, the Board of Directors and various committees of the Board regularly meet to review and discuss operational and financial reports presented by the Chief Executive Officer and other members of management as well as reports by experts and other advisors. Corporate review sessions are also offered to Directors to give them more detailed views of our businesses, such as corporate opportunities, technology, and operations. The Board oversees succession planning and talent development for senior executive positions. The Human Resources Committee has primary responsibility for developing succession plans for the CEO position. Members of the Board are expected to attend Board meetings in person unless the meeting is held by means of remote communication. The Board held six meetings in 2023. Directors are also expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All Directors attended the 2023 Annual Meeting. In 2023, all Directors attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and of the Committees on which each served. Board’s Role in Risk Oversight The Board is responsible for overseeing our policies and procedures for assessing and managing risk over the short-, medium- and long-term. Management is responsible for assessing and managing our exposures to risk on a day-to-day basis, including the creation of appropriate risk management policies and procedures. Management also is responsible for informing the Board of our most significant risks and our plans for managing those risks, as well as for disclosing our material risks in our periodic reports. Annually, the Board reviews the Company’s strategic business plans, which includes evaluating the competitive, technological, economic, environmental and other risks associated with these plans. In addition, under its charter, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management the Company’s significant financial, compliance, ethics, and operational risk exposures and the steps management has taken to detect, monitor and control such exposures, including the Company’s risk assessment and risk management policies. This includes, among other matters, evaluating risk in the context of financial policies, counterparty and credit risk, and the appropriate mitigation of risk, including through the use of insurance where appropriate. The Audit Committee also oversees our compliance program and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The internal audit organization provides the Committee with an assessment of the Company’s risks and conducts assurance reviews of the Company’s internal controls. The finance, compliance and internal audit organizations each provide regular updates to the Audit Committee. The Company’s senior internal auditing executive and Chief Compliance Officer each meet annually in executive session with the Audit Committee. The senior internal auditing executive and Chief Compliance Officer review with the Audit Committee each year’s annual internal audit and compliance risk assessment, which is focused on significant financial, operating, regulatory and legal matters. The Audit Committee also receives regular reports on completed internal audits of these significant risk areas. In accordance with its charter, the Audit Committee provides the senior internal auditing executive with access to communicate personally and directly with the members of the Committee at any time on any auditing or internal control matter, and it provides the Chief Compliance Officer with such access on any matter of compliance and ethics. The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Senior Executive Vice President and General Counsel. The Audit Committee also reviews and discusses with management the Company’s privacy and data security, including cybersecurity, risk exposures, policies, and practices, including the steps management has taken to detect, monitor and control such risks and the potential impact of those AT&T INC. 20 2024 PROXY Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE exposures on the Company’s business, financial results, operations and reputation. In addition, the Audit Committee, as well as the Board of Directors, receive reports from officers with responsibilities for cybersecurity. The AT&T Chief Security Office establishes policy and requirements for the security of AT&T’s computing and networking environments. Ethics and Compliance Program The Board has adopted a written Code of Ethics applicable to Directors, officers, and employees that outlines our corporate values and standards of integrity and behavior and is designed to foster a culture of integrity, drive compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and protect and promote the reputation of our Company. The full text of the Code of Ethics is posted on our website at investors.att.com. Our Chief Compliance Officer has responsibility to implement and maintain an effective ethics and compliance program. He also has responsibility to provide updates on our ethics and compliance programs to the Audit Committee. Board Leadership Structure William E. Kennard, an independent Director, has served as Chairman of the Board, since 2021 and has served as a Director of AT&T since 2014. In addition, Mr. Kennard presides over meetings of the independent members of the Board, who meet in executive session (without management Directors or management personnel present) at least four times per year. While the Board’s current practice is to elect an independent Chairman, our Directors have a fiduciary duty to regularly evaluate and determine the most appropriate Board leadership structure for AT&T and our stockholders, considering the Company’s needs, circumstances, and opportunities. The Board believes continued flexibility is in the best interest of the Company. In situations where the Chairman of the Board is not independent, our Company policies require the appointment of an independent Lead Director, with robust and clearly defined responsibilities. We regularly discuss our leadership structure with stockholders as part of our annual engagement program, and stockholders continue to express support for our approach to Board leadership. Each of the Audit, Human Resources, Governance and Policy, Corporate Development and Finance, and Executive Committees is composed entirely of independent Directors. Duties and Responsibilities Chairman of the Board • Presides over meetings of the Board • Presides over meetings of stockholders • Approves the agenda for each Board meeting • Approves the agenda for each stockholder meeting • Represents the Board in communications with stockholders and other stakeholders Chief Executive Officer • In charge of the affairs of the Company, subject to the overall direction and supervision of the Board and its committees • Consults and advises the Board and its committees on the business and affairs of the Company • Performs such other duties as may be assigned by the Board Director Nomination Process The Board of Directors believes that the Company benefits from having experienced Directors who bring a wide range of skills and backgrounds to the Boardroom. The Governance and Policy Committee is responsible for identifying eligible candidates based on our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which includes the consideration of a candidate’s: • general understanding of elements relevant to the success of a large publicly traded company in the current business environment; • understanding of our business; • educational and professional background; • judgment, competence, anticipated participation in Board activities; and • experience, geographic location, and special talents or personal attributes The Committee also considers whether the candidate is capable of devoting the necessary time to discharge their duties, taking into account memberships on other boards and other responsibilities. In addition, the Committee believes that diversity is an important factor in determining the composition of the Board, and the Committee considers it in making nominee recommendations. Stockholders who wish to suggest qualified candidates should write to the Office of the Corporate Secretary, AT&T Inc., 208 S. Akard Street, Suite 2951, Dallas, Texas 75202, stating in detail the qualifications of the persons proposed for consideration by the Committee. 2024 PROXY 21 AT&T INC. Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Director Independence Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a substantial majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent Directors. In addition, the NYSE Listing Standards require a majority of the Board and every member of the Audit Committee, Human Resources Committee, and Governance and Policy Committee to be independent. For a Director to be “independent” under the NYSE standards, the Board must affirmatively determine that the Director has no material relationship with AT&T, either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with AT&T, other than in his or her capacity as a Director of AT&T. In addition, the Director must meet certain independence standards specified by the NYSE. Using these standards for determining the independence of its members, the Board has determined that the following Directors are independent: Scott T. Ford Michael B. McCallister Glenn H. Hutchins Beth E. Mooney William E. Kennard Matthew K. Rose Stephen J. Luczo Cynthia B. Taylor Marissa A. Mayer Luis A. Ubiñas In addition, each member of the Audit Committee, the Governance and Policy Committee, and the Human Resources Committee is independent. In determining the independence of the Directors, the Board considered the following commercial relationships between AT&T and companies at which our Directors serve as Executive Officers or employees. Each of the entities where Mr. Ford and Ms. Taylor serve as executive officers purchased communications services from subsidiaries of AT&T. In each case for the year 2023: • The relevant products and services were provided by AT&T on terms determined on an arm’s length basis that were comparable to the terms provided to similarly situated customers; • The transactions were made in the ordinary course of business of each company; and • The total payments to AT&T by the other company (for communications services) were each less than 1% of the consolidated gross revenues of each of AT&T and the other company. This level is significantly below the maximum amount permitted under the NYSE Listing Standards for director independence (i.e., 2% of consolidated gross revenues). In addition, Mr. Kennard, through a private equity investment management company in which he has a less than 5% equity interest, invests in certain companies that engage in commercial transactions with AT&T. Noting Mr. Kennard’s limited ownership interest in this management company and that he is not an employee or Executive Officer of this management company or of any of these investee companies, together with the fact that AT&T’s revenues from and spending with each of these investee companies are not material to AT&T, the Board determined that Mr. Kennard is independent. AT&T INC. 22 2024 PROXY Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BOARD COMMITTEES From time to time the Board establishes standing committees and temporary special committees to assist the Board in carrying out its responsibilities.

The Office will either forward the original materials as addressed or provide Directors with summaries of the submissions, with the originals available for review at the Directors’ request. The Office does not forward or summarize advertisements, solicitations or other inappropriate materials. AT&T INC. 24 2024 PROXY Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Annual Multi-Step Board Evaluations Each year, the Governance and Policy Committee and the Chairman of the Board lead the Board through three evaluations: a Board self-evaluation, Committee self-evaluations, and peer evaluations. Through this process, Directors provide feedback, assess performance, and identify areas where improvement can be made. We believe this approach supports the Board’s effectiveness and continuous improvement. ONE-ON-ONE DIRECTOR PEER EVALUATIONS Members discuss the performance of other members of the Board including their: •  Understanding of the business •  Meeting attendance •  Preparation and participation in Board activities •  Applicable skill set to current needs of the business Responses are discussed with the individual Director if applicable.

Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Related Person Transactions Under the rules of the SEC, public issuers, such as AT&T, must disclose certain “Related Person Transactions.” These are transactions in which the Company is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a Director, Executive Officer, or holder of more than 5% of our common stock has a direct or indirect material interest. AT&T has adopted a written policy requiring that each Director or Executive Officer involved in such a transaction notify the Governance and Policy Committee and that each such transaction be approved by the Committee. In determining whether to approve a Related Person Transaction, the Committee will consider the following factors, among others, to the extent relevant to the Related Person Transaction: • whether the terms of the Related Person Transaction are fair to the Company and on the same basis as would apply if the transaction did not involve a related person, • whether there are business reasons for the Company to enter into the Related Person Transaction, • whether the Related Person Transaction would impair the independence of an outside director, and • whether the Related Person Transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any of our Directors or Executive Officers, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the Director, Executive Officer or other related person, the direct or indirect nature of the Director’s, Executive Officer’s or other related person’s interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any proposed relationship, and any other factors the Committee deems relevant. The Committee will prohibit a Related Party Transaction if it determines such transaction to be inconsistent with the interests of the Company and its stockholders. The employment of the following person was approved by the Governance and Policy Committee under the Company’s Related Party Transactions Policy. The rate of pay for this employee is similar to the rate of pay for comparable positions at the Company. During 2023, the daughter of John Stankey, Chief Executive Officer and President, was employed by an AT&T subsidiary with an approximate rate of pay, including commissions, of $140,880. Director Compensation The compensation of Directors is determined by the Board with the advice of the Governance and Policy Committee. The Governance and Policy Committee is composed entirely of independent Directors. None of our employees serve on this Committee. The Committee’s current members are Glenn H. Hutchins (Chair), William E. Kennard, Beth E. Mooney and Luis A. Ubiñas. Under its charter, the Committee annually reviews the compensation and benefits provided to Directors for their service and makes recommendations to the Board for changes. This includes not only Director retainers, but also Director compensation and benefit plans. The Committee’s charter authorizes the Committee to employ independent compensation and other consultants to assist in fulfilling its duties. From time to time, the Committee engages a compensation consultant to advise the Committee and to provide information regarding director compensation paid by other public companies, which may be used by the Committee to make compensation recommendations to the Board. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer may make recommendations to the Committee or the Board about types and amounts of appropriate compensation and benefits for Directors. Directors who are employed by us or one of our subsidiaries receive no separate compensation for serving as directors or as members of Board committees. AT&T INC. 26 2024 PROXY Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Company offers Directors both cash and equity compensation as set out in the table below. Directors have the ability to defer their annual retainers and earn interest or may defer their cash compensation through deferred stock units (See Director Plans). 2023 Compensation Amount ($) Annual Retainer 140,000 Chairman of the Board 300,000 Committee Chair Retainer Audit Committee 30,000 Human Resources Committee 25,000 Corporate Development and Finance Committee 20,000 Governance and Policy Committee 20,000 Annual Award of Deferred Stock Units 220,000 Annual Communications Service Stipend Within AT&T’s service area 4,000 Outside AT&T’s service area 6,000 Beginning in 2024 the Chairman of the Board and Committee Chairperson retainers will be as follows: Chairman of the Board - $250,000, Audit Committee - $40,000, Human Resources Committee - $30,000, Governance and Policy and Corporate Development and Finance Committees - $25,000. Director Plans Under the Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferral Plan (the Director Plan ) each continuing non-employee Director annually receives a grant of $220,000 in deferred stock units. The number of units granted is determined by dividing $220,000 by the closing price of AT&T common stock on the last trading day of the month in which the grant is made. A non-employee Director who is first elected to the Board on a day other than the day of the Annual Meeting receives a prorated grant based on the number of days served prior to the next Annual Meeting (using an assumed next Annual Meeting date one year following the last Annual Meeting). Each deferred stock unit is equivalent to a share of AT&T common stock and earns dividend equivalents in the form of additional deferred stock units. The annual grants are fully earned and vested at issuance and are distributed beginning in the calendar year after the Director leaves the Board. At distribution, the deferred stock units are converted to cash based on the then price of AT&T common stock and are paid either in a lump sum or in up to three annual installments, as elected by the Director. Additionally, Directors may annually elect to defer the receipt of their retainers into either additional deferred stock units or into a cash deferral account under the Director Plan. Directors purchase the deferred stock units at the fair market value of AT&T common stock. Deferrals into the cash deferral account under the plan earn interest during the calendar year at a rate equal to the Moody’s Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield Average for September of the preceding year ( Moody’s Rate ). Directors may annually choose to convert their cash deferral accounts into deferred stock units at the fair market value of our stock at the time of the conversion. Directors may also use all or part of their retainers to purchase AT&T common stock at fair market value under the Non-Employee Director Stock Purchase Plan. To the extent earnings on cash deferrals under the Director Plan exceed the interest rate specified by the SEC for disclosure purposes, they are included in the “Director Compensation” table on page 28 under the heading “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings.” Non-employee Directors may receive installation of equipment for the provision of Internet service at the Director’s primary residence, provided the residence is served by an AT&T affiliate. Monthly billing for such service is paid by the Director. Each Director within AT&T’s service area receives an annual stipend of $4,000, and each Director outside of AT&T’s service area receives an annual stipend of $6,000. In addition, each Director is entitled to receive one phone and one tablet every two years. Monthly billing for service for such devices is paid by the Director. 2024 PROXY 27 AT&T INC.

AT&T INC. 30 2024 PROXY Table of Contents Commitment to Sustainability CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY INTEGRATION ACROSS AT&T OPERATIONS The issues we manage under our Corporate Responsibility program represent risks, opportunities and important external impacts we consider in our strategy and operations. These pages detail how our integrated approach delivers long-term value for AT&T and positive social and environmental impact for our stakeholders. Board and Executive Oversight The AT&T Board of Directors Governance and Policy Committee (GPC) has direct oversight of Corporate Responsibility strategy, related policies, programs and reporting. It also oversees our policies for political and philanthropic giving, which include political contributions, corporate contributions approved by the AT&T Contributions Council and grants approved by the AT&T Foundation. In 2023, the GPC held six meetings. Our Senior Vice President – Corporate Responsibility, who is also Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), presents at the GPC and Board meetings and provides educational materials through a Corporate Responsibility Board portal. Materials and discussions cover Environmental, Social and Governance topics such as: digital divide; social innovation; responsible supply chain; business-affecting climate transition; public corporate responsibility reporting; and political and charitable contributions. The CSO also holds discussions with individual Committee members as needed throughout the year. The company’s Chief Diversity Officer presents updates to the GPC and provides workforce metrics for each GPC meeting. Two other Board committees oversee specific corporate responsibility factors as part of their full charters, the Audit Committee and the Human Resources Committee. The Audit Committee oversees AT&T compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as internal enterprise risk assessment activities, which include privacy and data security. The Human Resources Committee oversees human capital management at AT&T, including factors such as employee benefit plans, professional development and relevant executive compensation. Our CSO oversees internal management of AT&T’s corporate responsibility strategy, risks and opportunities. Our SVP – Audit Services oversees internal enterprise risk assessment activities and audit functions, including analysis of risks and disclosures, and associated processes, controls and assurance. Internally, our CSO leads our Corporate Responsibility (CR) Governance Council, which is comprised of more than a dozen Officers who lead the business operations aligned to our most important ESG focus areas. The CR Governance Council held three meetings in 2023 and covered ESG topics such as digital divide, business-affecting climate transition, political contributions, corporate responsibility reporting, Inclusion, long-range goal setting and social issue engagement. In addition to the CR Governance Council, we convene core issue committees focused on the community, digital divide, disclosure, environment and human rights. These committees are led by senior leaders who work closely with subject matter experts throughout our business to implement and enhance programs and policies that address Corporate Responsibility issues across AT&T. 2024 PROXY 31 AT&T INC. Table of Contents COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY Corporate Responsibility Reporting Each year, we engage hundreds of subject matter experts and business unit approvers across the Company to prepare, review, and continuously enhance our reporting and disclosures. Prior to publication, our annual Sustainability Summary data and content are reviewed by our CEO, the CR Governance Council and senior executives across the business. CR disclosures are further validated by our legal and finance organizations and select environmental calculations – such as energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – are externally assured by an independent third party. We seek to deliver a comprehensive reporting suite featuring consistent and comparable metrics. To do so, we align our reporting with several ESG frameworks. These include the Global Reporting Initiative standards, which we’ve aligned to since 2007, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations, and the CDP Climate Change assessment. Our reporting also aligns with the United Nations Global Compact and Sustainable Development Goals. In the U.S., the Company and our affiliated Employee PACs are committed to compliance with applicable laws and other requirements regarding contributions to political organizations, candidates for federal, state and local public office, ballot measure campaigns, PACs and trade associations. Our biannual Political Engagement Report describes our political engagement priorities, how we participate in the political process and discloses our U.S. political contributions. With oversight from the Governance and Policy Committee and visibility of the full Board, every action we take is guided by our public Political Engagement Priorities and our Political Engagement Policy. Since 2019, AT&T has received the leading “Trendsetter” designation from the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, for transparent reporting of our engagements. In 2023, AT&T received a 100% score for the third consecutive year. 100% SCORE Third year in a row from the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability Network and Data Security and Privacy Network and data security and privacy are crucial to our mission of delivering connectivity services that businesses and consumers can trust. The Chief Security Office, led by our Chief Security Officer, establishes global policy and programmatic requirements designed to help protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of our network. Our Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) is responsible for developing, implementing and supporting compliance with our privacy principles, policies and commitments – in accordance with international, federal and state legislation. Our Transparency Report lists the number and types of legal demands that have compelled AT&T to provide information about the communications of our customers as well as information permitted by law to be disclosed about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act requests. Supply Chain Management A diverse, ethical and sustainable supply chain is crucial for mitigating risk, realizing new opportunities, delivering excellence and creating long-lasting value for AT&T and our stakeholders. We expect supplier business operations to be conducted in compliance with sustainability clauses in our contracts, which require conformance with the AT&T Principles of Conduct for Suppliers and the AT&T Human Rights Policy. Suppliers are required to verify adherence to our Principles of Conduct for Suppliers through a self-attestation process every 18-24 months. We screen potential suppliers prior to contract execution and monitor contracted suppliers to ensure we do not conduct business with entities that pose risks to our operations, brand or reputation. AT&T INC. 32 2024 PROXY Table of Contents COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY We have an ongoing goal to lead our supply chain to improve its impacts by requesting sustainability data from suppliers representing 80% of our spend. In 2023, we reached 85% of our spend, exceeding our goal for the third consecutive year. In addition, through our participation alongside peer telecom companies in the Joint Alliance for CSR, we engage suppliers at risk of noncompliance with certain ESG standards – such as child or forced labor, health and safety, freedom of association, non-discrimination, working hours, compensation, and business ethics – in on-site audits and corrective action plans. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Understanding and mitigating climate change is fundamental to connecting our customers to greater possibility. AT&T is amplifying our positive environmental impact through enhancements in resource efficiency and optimizing the resilience of our business through efforts to protect our network and stakeholders from environmental risk. i 48.7% REDUCTION In Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, reaching 77% of our 2030 target* $663M SAVINGS In annualized energy cost due to energy efficiency projects* 188M METRIC TONS OF CO2e Reduction in customer emissions, enabled by AT&T Smart Climate Solutions *Data measured between 2015 and 2023 Mitigating Climate Change We’ve established a goal to become carbon neutral, targeting net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 1 by the end of 2035. To help measure our progress, we launched a science-based target to reduce emissions for these same categories 63% by year-end 2030 (2015 baseline) – aligning with a 1.5°C pathway. Between 2015-2023, we reduced reported Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 48.7%, reaching 77% of our 2030 target. 2 A key component of our emissions reduction strategy is enhancing operational efficiency. Between 2015-2023, we implemented nearly 161K energy efficiency projects – such as the ongoing integration of our centrally-managed Enterprise Building Management Solution across our footprint and decommissioning obsolete portions of our network operations – resulting in annualized energy cost savings of approximately $663 million. We also continue to grow our procurement of renewable energy, where feasible. AT&T is currently #5 on the EPA Green Power Partnership list. Climate-related Impacts Extreme weather presents operational risks to AT&T’s network and safety risks to our employees, customers and communities. We’re taking steps to protect our network from threats and costly repairs associated with such events, while helping communities identify and address their own vulnerabilities. By modeling the potential for climate hazards within our operational footprint, our industry-leading Climate Change Analysis Tool (CCAT) helps network engineers analyze how inland and coastal flooding, drought, wind or wildfires may impact existing infrastructure or future network builds – up to 30 years into the future. In collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory, we launched the Climate Risk and Resilience Portal (ClimRR). ClimRR provides free and equitable access to leading climate datasets to support analysis and data-driven planning for future climate risks. The portal empowers non-technical individuals, organizations, planners and decision-makers at state, local, tribal, and territorial 2024 PROXY 33 AT&T INC. Table of Contents COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY governments to gain awareness of future climate conditions to support community resilience. Environmental Performance of our Supply Chain AT&T’s supply chain contributes to our emissions footprint and presents unique climate-related risks and opportunities. To address this, we engage suppliers to reduce the environmental impact of their operations. In 2022, we met our Scope 3 science-based target 2 years ahead of schedule. In 2023, suppliers representing 55% of our spend – against our target goal of 50% – have set science-based Scope 1 and 2 targets. This goal covers AT&T spend including purchased goods and services, capital goods and downstream leased assets. Supporting Customer Environmental Objectives Beyond our commitments focused on our own operations, we have a goal to help business customers leverage our connectivity to help collectively reduce a gigaton (one billion metric tons) of GHG emissions by 2035. We’re helping these customers reduce their environmental footprint through adoption of AT&T Smart Climate Solutions – broadband-enabled technologies such as online collaboration tools and IoT solutions for fleet, asset and building energy management. As of year-end 2023, we’ve achieved 19% of our Gigaton goal and have enabled customers to reduce more than 188 million metric tons of CO2e. We measure our impact using a methodology developed in collaboration with Carbon Trust and BSR. COMMUNITY IMPACT At AT&T, we’re committed to connecting people to greater possibility. Our efforts to help bridge the digital divide, foster an inclusive environment, support the development of our employees and protect human rights are examples of how we help our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities thrive. Further, these social factors influence the near- and long-term success of our Company. $2B INVESTED To help bridge the digital divide, completing our 2021-2023 commitment. 34 CONNECTED LEARNING CENTERS Opened in traditionally underserved neighborhoods $132M Invested to engage employees in 5.8 million hours of training and development Digital Divide Access to affordable and reliable internet service is critical for work, health, learning and commerce – and for staying digitally connected to family, friends, news and information. Leveraging our resources to address the digital divide is strategically important to AT&T. We’re investing in our networks and working with state and local governments to build out broadband networks to expand high-speed internet access to more people. This work helps drive social change while expanding our network reach and deepening valuable collaboration with communities, authorities and NGOs. In 2023, we completed our commitment to invest $2 billion between 2021 and the end of 2023 to help bridge the digital divide. Our efforts have promoted broadband affordability, accessibility and safe adoption. We continue to offer low-cost, high-speed internet service available for qualifying low-income households through our Access from AT&T program. AT&T also participates in the FCC’s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) to help make wired and wireless services more affordable for millions of American households. When combined with Access from AT&T, eligible households can receive high-speed fixed internet service at no monthly charge. All households that quality for ACP are eligible for Access from AT&T. Through our AT&T Connected Learning community program, by year-end 2025, we seek to provide 1M people in need with digital resources and/or skills needed to succeed. Through the end of 2023, we opened 34 AT&T Connected Learning Centers in traditionally underserved neighborhoods facing barriers to connectivity, and we intend to increase this figure to more than 50 by the end of 2024. AT&T Connected Learning Centers provide access to high-speed internet and computing devices, as well as opportunities for tutoring and mentorship through our AT&T INC. 34 2024 PROXY Table of Contents COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY employee-driven AT&T Believes volunteerism initiative. Also part of AT&T Connected Learning, AT&T offers digital education resources. For instance, The Achievery SM is a free digital learning platform to support K-12 student learning and success everywhere today’s connected students learn. Together with the Public Library Association and other national partners, we’re offering a collection of digital literacy courses and workshops to help parents and caregivers build skills and confidence using technology and to help their child’s safe online learning. We have also invested $3 million to extend a Digital Navigator program and community-based IT help desk. This effort began in late 2022 and, as of the end of 2023, we have trained more than 150 community members to become digital navigators, providing service to more than 10,000 residents in Miami, St. Louis, Dallas, and Sacramento, Calif. Inclusion From our Board of Directors to front-line workers across the globe, we seek talented people who represent a mix of backgrounds, identities, viewpoints, abilities and experiences. Our strategy for employee inclusivity is led by the AT&T Chief Diversity Officer, who also is a member of the CR Governance Council. To promote employee engagement and cross-functional cultural initiatives across our business, we regularly convene several inclusion councils, including a Senior Executive Inclusion Council made up of key officers and executives in the business. Data on the makeup of our global workforce is regularly provided to Board members and discussed in depth at least once a year with the Governance and Policy Committee and the full board. All employees can join any of AT&T’s 26 Employee Groups, which are the vanguard of our efforts to advance our culture and encourage inclusivity across AT&T. Those principles extend into our hiring, career development, and employee experience strategies and practices. AT&T continues to receive third party awards and accolades, such as Fair360 Top 50 Companies for Diversity, Human Rights Campaign Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+, Disability Equality Index Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion and Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. Employee Talent Development As the global economy evolves, it’s crucial to train – and retain – a skilled and diverse workforce, and to help ensure our colleagues have the tools needed for continued success. Our internal training organization – AT&T Learning & Development – works across our business to deliver strategic leadership training, inspire continuous development for current and future roles, and energize our workforce to drive innovation. AT&T Learning & Development builds and enhances skills and capabilities in an evolving technological world, developing leaders who enhance the skills of others and role model critical competencies for the rest of the organization. In 2023, AT&T invested approximately $132 million to engage employees in 5.8 million hours of training and development, plus $10.3 million in higher education tuition assistance. Human Rights Business success and ethical behavior go hand-in-hand, and protecting human rights is fundamental to our operations, supply chain and engagement with key stakeholders. The AT&T Human Rights Policy details our commitment to upholding internationally recognized principles supporting rights to privacy, freedom of expression, fair labor practices, ethical use of artificial intelligence and protection from harmful online content – particularly for children.

The Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which may be viewed on the Company’s web site at investors.att.com. The Audit Committee performs a review and reassessment of its charter annually. The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of AT&T’s financial statements, the independent auditors’ qualifications and independence, the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors, AT&T’s compliance with legal and regulatory matters, and enterprise risk management, including privacy and data security.

The members of the Audit Committee are Ms. Taylor (Chair), Mr. Luczo, Mr. McCallister, and Mr. Ubiñas each of whom was appointed by the Board of Directors. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate under NYSE listing standards. In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that Ms. Taylor is an “audit committee financial expert.” Although the Board of Directors has determined that she has the requisite attributes to be considered an “audit committee financial expert” as defined under SEC rules, her responsibilities are the same as those of the other Audit Committee members. She is not AT&T’s auditor or accountant, does not perform “field work” and is not a full-time employee. The SEC has determined that an audit committee member who is designated as an audit committee financial expert will not be deemed to be an “expert” for any purpose as a result of being identified as an audit committee financial expert.

Significant internal audit reports and corrective action status are regularly discussed with the Audit Committee. Risk Review The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management the Company’s significant financial, compliance, ethics, and operational risk exposures and the steps management has taken to detect, monitor and control such exposures, including the Company’s risk assessment and risk management policies. This includes, among other matters, evaluating risk in the context of financial policies, counterparty and credit risk, and the appropriate mitigation of risk, including through the use of insurance where appropriate. The Audit Committee also reviews and discusses with management the Company’s privacy and data security, including cybersecurity, risk exposures, policies, and practices, including the steps management has taken to detect, monitor and control such risks and the potential impact of those exposures on the Company’s business, financial results, operations and reputation.

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES Ernst & Young LLP acts as AT&T’s principal auditor and provides certain audit-related, tax and other services. The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy for services to be performed by Ernst & Young. Under this policy, the Audit Committee approves specific engagements when the engagements have been presented in reasonable detail to the Audit Committee before services are undertaken. This policy also allows for the approval of certain services in advance of the Audit Committee being presented details concerning the specific service to be undertaken. These services must meet service definitions and fee limitations previously established by the Audit Committee. Additionally, engagements exceeding $500,000 must receive advance concurrence from the Audit Committee Chairman. After an auditor is engaged under this authority, the services must be described in reasonable detail to the Audit Committee at the next meeting. All pre-approved services must commence, if at all, within 14 months of the approval.

In the following pages, we discuss the elements of our compensation program and how our program supports pay for performance. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2023 KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS In 2023, we continued to live our purpose of connecting people to greater possibility – with expertise, simplicity and inspiration. We remained committed to creating stockholder value as we invested in becoming the leader in converged connectivity as we build lasting, profitable 5G and fiber customer relationships. Our 2023 key accomplishments are highlighted as follows: • We again added customers in a profitable manner thanks to our consistent go-to-market approach and value proposition. Over the past three years, we added 7.8 million postpaid phone subscribers to America’s most reliable 5G network 1 . This marks our best three years of postpaid phone net adds in over a decade. In 2023, we gained 1.7 million postpaid phone net adds as we maintained historically low churn and grew wireless service revenues by 4.4%. With AT&T Fiber, we have the nation’s largest consumer fiber network 2 and have added more than 1 million net adds for 6 straight years. In 2023, we grew broadband revenues by 8.1% with fiber revenues growing approximately 27%. 1 Based on nationwide GWS drive test data. GWS conducts paid drive tests for AT&T and uses the data in its analysis. AT&T 5G requires compatible plan and device. 5G not available everywhere. 2 Based on fiber to the home households using the latest publicly available data. 2024 PROXY 39 AT&T INC. Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS • Our profitable customer growth, with improving revenues and increased efficiencies, drove strong financial and operating results. For the full year, Mobility operating income grew 8.6% compared to 2022. • In total, we delivered cash from operations of $38.3 billion for the full year, which is up $2.5 billion compared to 2022. We generated full-year free cash flow 3 of $16.8 billion, which is up $2.6 billion compared to 2022. This level of free cash flow provides more than twice the coverage of our approximately $8 billion annual common dividend. • We made solid progress on strengthening our balance sheet. While total debt increased $1.4 billion, net debt 3 decreased by $3.3 billion in the year. We achieved this while investing at near-historic levels with $17.9 billion in capital expenditures and $5.7 billion of cash payments for vendor financing, or $23.6 billion of capital investment 3 . 3 See Annex A for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial results and Cautionary Language Concerning Forward Looking Statements.

The Committee’s responsibilities include: Compensation Oversight Management Oversight •  Determining compensation for our Executive Officers; •  Reviewing, approving, and administering our executive compensation plans and approving employee benefit plans; •  Establishing performance objectives under our incentive compensation plans; •  Determining the attainment of performance objectives and the resulting awards to be made to our Executive Officers; and •  Evaluating Executive Officer compensation practices to ensure that they remain equitable and competitive. •  Evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO); •  Reviewing the performance and capabilities of other Executive Officers, based on input from the CEO; and •  Succession planning for Executive Officer positions, including the CEO position. 2024 PROXY 41 AT&T INC. Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS GUIDING PAY PRINCIPLES The Committee believes that our programs should align with stockholder interests and be competitive and market-based, align with generally accepted practices and our pay for performance philosophy, and balance both short- and long-term focus. To that end, we incorporate many best practices in our compensation programs and avoid ones that are not aligned with our guiding pay principles. ALIGNMENT WITH STOCKHOLDERS Incorporate stockholder perspectives and feedback into any compensation program enhancements. Engagement with stockholders is a key part of the Committee’s decision-making process, and AT&T has a long history of incorporating stockholder perspectives into our executive compensation program. Each year, we engage with stockholders in both the spring and fall to understand their views on executive compensation and other topics. In addition to the support shared through direct engagement, our stockholders supported our program with 92% of votes cast for approval of the “say on pay” proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We provide details of discussions with stockholders over the past year in the Proxy Statement Summary. COMPETITIVE & MARKET BASED Evaluate our compensation and benefits compared to appropriate peer companies to ensure we attract and retain world-class talent with leadership abilities and experience necessary to develop and execute business strategies, obtain superior results, and build long-term stockholder value. PAY FOR PERFORMANCE Tie a significant portion of compensation to stock price and/or the achievement of predetermined goals that contribute to our success. For example, see at-risk target compensation for each Named Executive Officer (NEO) under 2023 Total Target Compensation and Pay Mix . BALANCED SHORT- & LONG-TERM FOCUS Ensure that the compensation program provides an appropriate balance between the achievement of short- and long-term performance objectives, with a clear emphasis on managing the sustainability of the business and mitigating risk. PRINCIPLED PROGRAM Structure our program so that it aligns with both corporate governance best practices and our strategic objectives while remaining easy to explain and communicate. PAY GOVERNANCE The Committee designs our compensation and benefits program around the following market-leading practices: ✓ OUR PRACTICES û WHAT WE DON’T DO ✓ Pay for performance. ✓ Multiple performance metrics and multi-year time horizons. ✓ Stock ownership and holding period requirements. ✓ Regular engagement with stockholders. ✓ Dividend equivalents. ✓ Restitution and Clawback policies. ✓ Severance policy limits payments to 2.99 times salary and target bonus. û No “single trigger” change in control provisions. û No tax gross-ups, except in extenuating circumstances. û No hedging or short sales of AT&T stock or stock-based awards, and no guaranteed bonuses. û No supplemental executive retirement benefits for officers promoted/hired after 2008. û No excessive dilution; as of June 1, 2023, our total dilution was 1.0% of outstanding stock. AT&T INC. 42 2024 PROXY Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS COMPENSATION ELEMENTS AND PAY DETERMINATION ELEMENTS OF 2023 COMPENSATION Stockholders’ interests are best represented by a compensation program that is properly structured to attract, retain, and motivate our executives to lead the Company effectively, thus creating stockholder value. Our program contains various elements, each designed for a different purpose, with the overarching goal of encouraging a high level of sustainable individual and Company performance well into the future: FOCUS ON CURRENT YEAR PERFORMANCE SALARY AND CASH-BASED SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES + FOCUS ON MULTI-YEAR PERFORMANCE LONG-TERM INCENTIVES: 75% PERFORMANCE SHARES 25% RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS + FOCUS ON ATTRACTION & RETENTION RETIREMENT, DEFERRAL/ SAVINGS PLANS, BENEFITS, AND PERSONAL BENEFITS The chart below more fully describes the elements of total direct compensation and their link to our business and talent strategies. Reward Element Link to Business and Talent Strategies FIXED PAY Base Salary •  Provides current compensation for the day-to-day responsibilities. •  Current pay level recognizes experience, skill, and performance, with the goal of being market competitive. •  Future adjustments may be based on individual performance, pay relative to other executives, and/or pay relative to market. AT-RISK PAY Short-Term Incentives •  Aligns pay with the achievement of short-term Company objectives. •  Payouts are based on achievement of predetermined goals, with potential for adjustment (up or down) by the Committee to align pay with actual performance. Long-Term Incentives •  Motivates and rewards the achievement of long-term Company objectives. •  Aligns executive and stockholder interests. DETERMINING 2023 TARGET COMPENSATION The Committee uses market data as the starting point for determining Executive Officer compensation. The independent consultant compiles data from peer companies using both proxy data and third-party compensation surveys, then presents findings to the Committee for their review and decision-making process. How the Peer Group Was Chosen The Committee, based on input from its consultant, established a peer group that was representative of companies consistent with AT&T’s business in 2023. The peer group included large cap companies with similar scale and business complexity to AT&T. The Committee and independent consultant confirmed that the peer group composition reflected AT&T’s business transformation into a simplified telecom provider, the company’s scale (revenue, market capitalization, and enterprise value), and investments in technology and tech-enabled services. 2024 PROXY 43 AT&T INC. Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Based on the responsibilities of each executive’s role, the Committee evaluated compensation against the same or similar positions in the peer group companies. If a peer company did not have a role corresponding to a particular AT&T executive, it was omitted from the peer group for the executive. 2023 AT&T Peer Group Alphabet Boeing Comcast Intel Netflix T-Mobile US Wal-Mart Amazon Charter General Electric IBM Oracle UPS Walt Disney Apple Cisco General Motors Microsoft Salesforce Verizon As part of its annual review of the peer group and to continue its approach to align executive interests to those of stockholders, the Committee conducted a comprehensive assessment and established the 2024 peer group by removing mega cap companies (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft). The Committee took this action to proactively align the company’s size and business operations to a peer group that includes competitors for talent and investor dollars. For 2024, the Committee will use this peer group for benchmarking and the S&P 500 Index to measure the Total Stockholder Return modifier applicable to Performance Share awards (see page 53 for more details). The Committee’s Process for Establishing 2023 Target Compensation The Committee’s consultant reviewed market data from the peer group with members of management and the CEO (for Executive Officers other than himself) to confirm job matches and scoping of market data based on the relative value of each position and differences in responsibilities between jobs at AT&T and those in the peer group. After completing this review, the consultant presented the market data to the Committee. The Committee used the market data with the CEO’s evaluation of performance and compensation recommendations for the other Executive Officers and then applied its judgment and experience to set Executive Officer target compensation. While the Committee does consider peer group compensation information when setting executive compensation, it does not believe it appropriate to establish compensation amounts based solely on this data. The Committee believes that compensation decisions are multi-dimensional and require consideration of additional factors, including market competition for the position and the executive’s experience, performance, contributions, long-term potential, and leadership. In addition, to determine CEO pay, the Board continued to use its formal annual performance evaluation process. The performance evaluation consists of the Board reviewing key strategic and leadership behaviors and providing feedback directly to Mr. Stankey regarding his performance and the performance of the company. 2023 Total Target Compensation and Pay Mix The Committee designs the executive compensation program to include at-risk pay such as incentive awards and stock-based compensation. These incentives tie the interests of our executives to those of our stockholders. As explained above, the Committee reviewed target pay in January for the NEOs and determined total target compensation for 2023. The Committee adjusted compensation and pay mix as follows to align with market data of peers. Upon promotion to CEO in 2020, Mr. Stankey’s total target compensation was established at $21.5 million and had not been adjusted since. In 2023, the Committee conducted a robust analysis of the compensation landscape, which included input from its independent consultant, market data, and consideration of our guiding compensation principles. It also took into consideration Mr. Stankey’s performance and tenure in the CEO role, and that his compensation was falling behind that of market peers. As a result of this review, the Committee did not change his cash compensation, but approved an increase to Mr. Stankey’s long-term target compensation of $3 million to align with market peers amidst increasing competition for talent in our industry, while maintaining our commitment to incentivize performance aligned with the long-term interests of stockholders. As a result of this same market analysis, adjustments for other NEOs were made to align to market as we continue to balance opportunity and pay mix.

The Committee maintained the metrics and weightings for their continued link to our business strategy. For executive officers, the Committee maintained the strategic metric with a 20% weighting to further drive performance within the framework of AT&T’s culture and purpose.

Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS The chart below describes the long-term awards our NEOs earned in 2023 or early 2024. Due to a shift from vesting at the end of four years (cliff vesting) in 2020, to vesting a third each year (ratable vesting) beginning in 2021, we describe both types of RSU grants. Form of Award Performance/Restriction Period and Metrics Description Performance Shares Granted in 2021 3-year performance period (2021-2023) –  Each Performance Share is a notional share equal in value to a share of common stock, which causes the value of the award to fluctuate directly with changes in our stock price over the performance period. 75% of 2021 Long-Term Award Performance metrics: –  100% ROIC –  Relative TSR payout modifier Payout value based on combination of performance attainment and common stock price performance. –  Once vested, Performance Shares settle 66% in cash and 34% in common stock. The amount of cash to be paid is based on our stock price on the date the award payout is approved. When combined with the RSU distribution, NEOs receive 50% of their long-term incentive compensation distributions in stock. –  Awards are based on a 3-year performance period and maximize both short-and long-term performance. The impact of a single year’s performance is felt in each of the three Performance Share grants outstanding at any given time, so that employees are motivated to sustain strong performance each year in order to gain favorable payouts. –  Dividend equivalents are paid at the end of the performance period, based on the number of Performance Shares earned. RSUs Granted in 2020 (cliff vesting) 25% of 2020 Long-Term Award 4-year restriction period Payout value based on common stock price performance. RSUs pay in common stock at the end of the restriction period, regardless of whether they vest earlier. RSUs vest 100% after four years or upon retirement eligibility, whichever occurs earlier. Dividend equivalents are paid quarterly in cash on the number of shares outstanding. RSUs Granted in 2021 & 2022 (ratable vesting) 25% of 2021 & 2022 Long-Term Awards 3-year restriction period Payout value based on common stock price performance. RSUs vest and pay in common stock 33-1/3% per year over three years unless they vest earlier due to retirement eligibility. They distribute on the normal schedule regardless of when they vest. Dividend equivalents are paid quarterly in cash on the number of shares outstanding. AT&T INC. 48 2024 PROXY Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ROIC Payout Table and Actual Performance Attainment – 2021-2023 Performance Period Determination of Performance Goal We established a ROIC performance target range of 6.00% to 7.00% at the beginning of the 3-year performance period. This target range does not reward or penalize Executive Officers for performance achievement within close proximity to the midpoint of the range. The lower end of the performance target range was set so that it exceeded our internally calculated weighted average cost of capital (determined, in part, based on input from banks) by 125 basis points, ensuring a reasonable return is delivered to stockholders before Executive Officers are eligible for full payout of their target award. We calculate ROIC by taking our annual reported net income minus minority interest and adding after-tax interest expense and dividing that result by the total of the average debt and average stockholder equity for the relevant year, subject to adjustments. The ROIC for each year is then averaged over the 3-year performance period to determine the final performance. Performance Below Target Range Achievement below the target range results in decreasing levels of award payout. No payout is earned if less than 63% of the performance target range is achieved. Performance Within Target Range 100% payout if performance falls within the target range. Performance Above Target Range Maximum payout of 150% is earned if 154% or more of the performance target range is achieved. Achievement above the target range provides for higher levels of award payout, up to the maximum payout. Actual Performance After conclusion of the performance period, the Committee determined (using the 2021 ROIC payout table summarized below) that we achieved ROIC of 8.7%, which was above the target range, and 395 basis points above the weighted average cost of capital we established based on input from banks. As a result, the Committee directed that 113% of the related Performance Shares be distributed in accordance with the payout table as follows (before applying the TSR modifier, as discussed on the next page). 2024 PROXY 49 AT&T INC.

The number of shares was based on the AT&T closing stock price of $21.74. The shares granted and closing stock price were adjusted for the WarnerMedia (WM) spin-off that occurred in 2022 (the Committee approved an increase in the number of shares underlying the impacted equity awards using the AT&T Adjustment Ratio of approximately 1.2202; the ratio was the result of the volume weighted average price of AT&T stock for the 10 trading days prior to, and the 10 trading days following the close of the transaction). The Company’s common stock price change over the 3-year performance period reduced the value of the shares earned. Therefore, NEOs realized 82% of the annual grant.

The number of RSUs was based on the AT&T closing stock price of $28.25. Shares granted and closing stock price were adjusted for the WM spin-off. The Company’s common stock price change during the 4-year restriction period reduced the value of the units granted, which resulted in NEOs realizing 54% of the annual award granted. In addition to the cliff vesting RSU grants, the Committee awarded a supplemental grant in connection with a promotion: • On June 25, 2020, the Committee awarded John Stankey a supplemental grant of $1,000,000 (40,368 RSUs) in connection with his promotion to CEO, which is subject to the same terms and conditions as Mr. Stankey’s annual 2020 grant, valued at $2,375,000 (77,431 RSUs). Combined, the grants represent Mr. Stankey’s total target value of $3,375,000 (117,799 RSUs) for 2020 RSUs. On January 28, 2021, the Committee awarded the ratable vesting RSU grant values shown in the above table. The number of RSUs was based on the AT&T closing stock price of $21.74. Shares granted and closing stock price were adjusted for the WM spin-off. The second tranche of the 2021 RSUs vested on January 13, 2023, at the $19.55 AT&T closing stock price. The Company’s common stock price change during the restriction period reduced the value of the units granted. Therefore, each NEO realized 83% of the annual shares granted. On January 27, 2022, the Committee awarded the ratable vesting RSU grant values shown in the above table. The number of RSUs was based on the AT&T closing stock price of $18.21. Shares granted and closing stock price were adjusted for the WM spin-off. The first tranche of the 2022 RSUs vested on January 13, 2023, at the $19.55 AT&T closing stock price. The Company’s common stock price change during the restriction period reduced the value of the units granted. Therefore, each NEO realized 99% of the annual shares granted. In addition to the above, Pascal Desroches received a long-term distribution in February 2023 in the amount of $899,668 from his time-based vested tranches of WM RSUs issued for 2019-2020. Beginning with the 2021 grant, Mr. Desroches received long-term awards in the same form as other NEOs. 2023 LONG-TERM GRANTS In January 2023, our NEOs received long-term awards in the form of: Type of Award Weight Performance Metrics Vesting Period Performance Shares 75% 50% Earnings per Share (EPS) Growth and 50% ROIC with Relative TSR Payout Modifier of 20% (only if positive), 0%, or -20% 3-year performance period RSUs 25% Payout value based on common stock price performance only 3-year restriction period with annual ratable vesting 2024 PROXY 51 AT&T INC.

The total long-term target for 2023 is shown in the 2023 Total Target Compensation and Pay Mix section. 2023 PERFORMANCE SHARE GRANTS The Performance Shares granted in 2023 are for the 2023-2025 performance period. The Committee determined that the Performance Shares would be tied to EPS Growth and ROIC performance metrics with a payout modifier based on a comparison of AT&T’s TSR to our AT&T Peer Group. EPS Goal—Payout Table Calculation and Description We established a three-year compound annual growth rate EPS performance target. Payouts may occur above or below the target depending on performance achievement. We calculate EPS by taking our annual adjusted net income minus minority and preferred interest and divide by our weighted average shares outstanding for the relevant year, subject to adjustments. A three-year compound annual growth rate is then computed by comparing the EPS for the final year of the performance period to the base year of the performance (year-end 2022) to determine the final performance. We do not disclose the internal absolute performance targets set for the three-year performance period because such disclosure would include competitively sensitive information and could be construed as earnings guidance; however, EPS performance targets are generally aligned to the Company’s long-term financial objectives and are disclosed following the end of the performance period. Potential payouts range from 0% to 200% of the number of Performance Shares granted. ROIC Goal—Payout Table Calculation and Description We established a ROIC performance target at the beginning of the three-year performance period. Payouts may occur above or below the target depending on performance achievement. We calculate ROIC for the 2023-2025 performance period by taking our annual reported net income minus minority interest and adding after-tax interest expense and dividing that result by the total of the average debt and average stockholder equity for the relevant year, subject to adjustments. The ROIC for each year is then averaged over the three-year performance period to determine the final performance. We do not disclose the internal absolute performance targets set for the three-year performance period because such disclosure would include competitively sensitive information and could be construed as earnings guidance; however, ROIC performance targets are generally aligned to the Company’s long-term financial objectives and are disclosed following the end of the performance period. Potential payouts range from 0% to 200% of the number of Performance Shares granted. Performance Exclusions The following performance exclusions apply to the 2023 Performance Share grants. For mergers and acquisitions and disposition activity for significant equity investments or direct or indirect ownership over $2.0 billion, we exclude the dilutive and cash flow impacts of intangible amortization, asset write-offs and impairments, accelerated depreciation, and transaction and restructuring costs so that the impact of certain significant transactions, including those which may not have been contemplated in the determination of a AT&T INC. 52 2024 PROXY Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS performance metric, will not have an impact on the performance results. We also exclude the dilutive or accretive and cash flow impacts of certain matters to the extent the collective net impact of such matters in one of the following specific categories exceeds $300 million in a calendar year: changes in accounting principles, changes in federal or state tax laws, expenses caused by natural disasters, accounting write-downs of goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets, and accounting gains/losses from asset dispositions and severance costs. Further exclusions are dilutive or accretive impact to EPS from repurchases of common shares that varies from budgeted levels of repurchases, and dilutive impacts related to issuances of common shares for purposes of merger and acquisition activity. Additionally, we disregard the actuarial and mark-to-market gains and losses related to the assets and liabilities of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans and rabbi trusts and benefit plan funding that varies from budget. TSR Performance Modifier We believe that TSR is an important measure because it helps ensure that our executives’ interests are aligned with those of stockholders. This modifier provides that 2023 Performance Share Award payouts may be adjusted based on our positive or negative TSR (stock appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends) performance relative to our AT&T Peer Group. TSR performance will be measured over the entire performance period. TSR PERFORMANCE MODIFIER 2023-2025 Performance Period AT&T Return vs. TSR Peer Group Payout Modifier Top Quartile Add 20 Percentage Points to Final ROIC/EPS Growth Payout Percentage; however, no TSR modifier will apply if AT&T’s relative TSR is negative Quartile 2 Quartile 3 No Adjustment to ROIC/EPS Growth Payout Percentage Quartile 4 Subtract 20 Percentage Points from Final ROIC/EPS Growth Payout Percentage At the end of the performance period, the number of Performance Shares to be paid out, if any, will be determined by comparing the actual performance of the Company against the predetermined performance objective for EPS Growth and ROIC, and modifying the award for relative TSR achievement, if applicable. In addition, the Committee may make discretionary adjustments. Combined Performance Shares and RSU distribution is 50% cash and 50% stock. For 2024, the Committee will use the S&P 500 Index to measure TSR Performance for the Performance Share awards. Initial research indicated wide use of S&P indices across the peer group companies, and additional research indicated that most peer companies use the S&P 500. The S&P 500 offers a broad composition of companies; therefore, changes in its broad composition do not distort AT&T’s relative performance. After consultation with its independent consultant, the Committee selected this index to better align with market and peer practice. 2023 RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANTS The Committee awarded 2023 RSU grants that will vest and distribute 33-1/3% each year over three years. Other grant terms include: (i) dividend equivalents paid quarterly on outstanding RSU grants in cash at the time regular dividends are paid on our common stock, (ii) paid 100% in stock to further tie executives’ interests to those of stockholders, (iii) fully vested at grant for retirement eligible officers; however, the award does not distribute until the scheduled distribution date, and (iv) continues to comprise 25% of NEOs’ total long-term incentives with 75% of total long-term incentives granted in the form of Performance Shares. 2024 PROXY 53 AT&T INC. Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS BENEFITS Benefits and Personal Benefits Benefits are an important tool to maintain the market competitiveness of our overall compensation package. We provide personal benefits to our Executive Officers for three main reasons: • To effectively compete for talent: These benefits allow us to have a competitive program to help us in our attraction and retention efforts. • To support Executive Officers in meeting the needs of the business: We require our Executive Officers to be available around-the-clock. Therefore, we provide them benefits that allow us to have greater access to them. These benefits should not be measured solely in terms of any incremental financial cost, but rather based on the value they bring the Company through maximized productivity and availability. • To provide for the safety, security, and personal health of executives: We provide Executive Officers certain personal benefits to provide for their safety and personal health. Benefits for our Executive Officers are outlined below. The Committee continuously evaluates these benefits based on needs of the business and prevailing market practices and trends. Deferral Opportunities Tax-qualified 401(k) Plans Our 401(k) plans are offered to substantially all our employees, including each of the NEOs, and provide the opportunity to defer income and receive Company matching contributions. Substantially all of our plans provide our employees the ability to invest in AT&T or other investments. We match 80% of manager contributions, limited to the first 6% of eligible 401(k) contributions (only base salary is matched for officers). Managers hired externally on or after January 1, 2015, do not earn pension benefits, and to account for the lack of a pension benefit, we provide an enhanced 401(k) match of 133-1/3% on the first 3% of eligible 401(k) contributions and 100% on the next 3% of eligible 401(k) contributions (only base salary is matched for officers). Nonqualified Plans We provide mid-level and above managers the opportunity for tax-advantaged savings through two AT&T nonqualified plans. All active NEOs were eligible to elect nonqualified deferrals from 2023 cash compensation through these plans. Stock Purchase and Deferral Plan This is our principal nonqualified deferral program for AT&T employees, which we use to encourage our managers to invest in and hold AT&T common stock on a tax-deferred basis. Cash Deferral Plan Through this plan, eligible AT&T managers may also defer pre-tax cash compensation in the form of salaries and bonuses. WarnerMedia Employee Supplemental Savings Plan Mr. Desroches is the only NEO with an account balance in this nonqualified restoration savings plan, that historically was made available to U.S. salaried WarnerMedia employees who earned eligible cash compensation in excess of the IRS compensation limit for tax-qualified plans. These plans are described more fully in the Executive Compensation Tables section. Pension Benefits During 2023, we offered a tax-qualified group pension benefit to approximately two-thirds of our AT&T managers. Managers hired externally on or after January 1, 2015, are not eligible to participate in the pension plan, and instead receive an enhanced match in the 401(k) plan. Former WarnerMedia managers who remained with AT&T are not eligible to earn pension benefits, though some of these employees have frozen pre-merger Time Warner pension benefits. We also provide supplemental retirement benefits under nonqualified pension plans, or Supplemental Employee Retirement Plans, to employees who became officers before 2009. In 2019, Mr. Stankey elected to freeze his Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP) benefits as if he had retired at the end of 2019. He gave up credits under the plan for all future compensation and service. In exchange, the frozen benefit earns a fixed rate of interest equal to the discount rate used to determine lump sum benefits for participants who retired in 2019. The interest credits continue until the SERP benefits are distributed to participants. AT&T INC. 54 2024 PROXY Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS At the end of 2022, the company froze the SERP benefits with similar terms as described above, for individuals that were officers of the Company prior to 2009 (since officers appointed after 2008 are not eligible for SERP benefits). This is a limited officer group, including Ms. Lee. Messrs. Desroches, McAtee and McElfresh are not eligible for any SERP benefits. Additional information on pension benefits, including these plans, may be found in the Executive Compensation Tables section, following the “Pension Benefits” table. Personal Benefits The Committee believes that personal benefits attract and retain talented executives and that the limited cost is outweighed by the benefits to the Company. The benefits are described below, and the value can be found in the Personal Benefits Table following the Summary Compensation Table . Financial Counseling Includes tax preparation, estate planning, and financial counseling. Health Coverage A consumer-driven health plan for certain executives, who must pay a portion of the premiums. Executive Physical Annual physical for executives who do not receive the health coverage shown above. Communications AT&T products and services provided at little or no incremental cost to the Company. Automobile Includes allowance, fuel, and maintenance. Executive Disability Provides compensation during a leave of absence due to illness or injury. Home Security Residential security system and monitoring. Executive Life Insurance We pay recoverable premiums for income protection of one times salary (two times for the CEO) in conjunction with group life with an option for employee-paid coverage of up to two times salary (see pages 66-67). Company-Owned Club Memberships To help achieve business objectives, attract talent to key operating hubs, and allow for continuity of access during personnel changes, the Company owns a limited number of social club and country club memberships. In some cases, we allow personal use of those memberships by executives at no additional cost to the Company. For company-owned country club memberships, the Company pays for assessments as the owner of the membership, but Executive Officers are responsible for paying all dues and other fees associated with their use of the membership. Personal Use of Aircraft As a general rule, corporate aircraft are dedicated to Company business. Any exception must be approved by the CEO as being in the Company’s interest to facilitate corporate scheduling and business priorities, and Executive Officers must reimburse the Company for the incremental cost of such usage unless approved otherwise by the CEO. This reimbursement requirement, however, may not be waived for the CEO. Certain of these benefits are also offered as post-retirement benefits to officers who meet age and service requirements. Additional information may be found in the Other Post-Retirement Benefits section of Executive Compensation Tables . 2024 PROXY 55 AT&T INC. Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS POLICIES AND RISK MITIGATION 2023 STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES The Committee has established common stock ownership guidelines for 2023 as shown below. We include shares held in our benefit plans in determining attainment of these guidelines. Each NEO was in compliance with AT&T’s guidelines as of December 31, 2023. Level Ownership Guidelines CEO 6 x Base Salary Executive Officers Lesser of 3 x Base Salary, or 50,000 Shares All Executive Officers are given 5 years from assuming their position to meet the minimum requirements. EQUITY RETENTION Executive Officers are required to hold shares equivalent, in the aggregate, to 25% of the AT&T shares they receive (after taxes and exercise costs) from an incentive, equity, or option award granted to them after January 1, 2012, until they terminate employment with AT&T. This requirement further ties executives’ compensation interests to interests of stockholders. HEDGING POLICY Executive officers are prohibited from hedging their AT&T stock or stock-based awards, including through trading in publicly-traded options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments related to AT&T stock. RESTITUTION AND CLAWBACK POLICIES Under the AT&T Inc. Policy on Restitution, we intend, in appropriate circumstances, to seek restitution of any bonus, commission, or other compensation received by an employee as a result of such employee’s intentional or knowing fraudulent or illegal conduct, including the making of a material misrepresentation in our financial statements. Furthermore, the Committee has adopted the AT&T Clawback Policy, which provides for the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive compensation received by covered executives in the event of a required restatement due to material errors or material misstatements. The AT&T Clawback Policy complies with Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act, as implemented by the NYSE listing standards. We believe that the Clawback Policy and the Policy on Restitution together give the Committee the authority, flexibility and discretion to seek recoupment of compensation whenever such action is warranted. RISK MITIGATION By ensuring that a significant portion of compensation is based on our long-term performance, we reduce the risk that executives will place too much focus on short-term achievements to the detriment of our long-term sustainability. Our short-term incentive compensation is structured so that the accomplishment of short-term goals supports the achievement of long-term goals. We conduct an annual compensation-related risk review to confirm that our programs do not encourage excessive risk taking and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. These elements work together for the benefit of AT&T and our stockholders and to reduce risk in our incentive plans. INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT The Committee is authorized by its charter to employ an independent compensation consultant and other advisors. The Committee has selected Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook) to serve as its independent consultant. The consultant reports directly to the Committee. Other than advising the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee on director compensation, FW Cook provides no other services to AT&T. To ensure that it continues to receive comprehensive, expert consulting services, and recommendations for setting executive pay to retain and attract talent to execute the Company’s strategic objectives, in 2022 the Committee initiated a Request for Proposal (RFP) process for independent compensation consultant services. FW Cook was invited to respond to the RFP, as were several other companies that provide independent compensation consultant services. After a thorough review process with evaluation of the candidates, the Committee renewed its engagement with FW Cook for independent compensation consultant services. The consultant: • Attends all Committee meetings; • Regularly updates the Committee on market trends, changing practices, and legislation AT&T INC. 56 2024 PROXY Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS pertaining to executive compensation and benefits; • Reviews the Company’s executive compensation strategy and program to ensure appropriateness and market competitiveness; • Makes recommendations on the design of the compensation program and the balance of pay-for-performance elements; • Provides market data for jobs held by senior leaders; • Analyzes compensation from other companies’ proxy and financial statements for the Committee’s review when making compensation decisions; • Assists the Committee in making pay determinations for the CEO; and • Advises the Committee on the appropriate comparator groups for compensation and benefits as well as the appropriate peer group against which to measure long-term performance. The Committee reviewed the following six independence factors, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, when evaluating the consultant’s independence: • Other services provided to AT&T • Percentage of the consultant’s revenues paid by AT&T • Consultant’s policies to prevent conflicts of interest • Other relationships with compensation committee members • AT&T stock owned by the consultant • Other relationships with Executive Officers Based on its evaluation of the consultant and the six factors listed above, the Committee has determined that the consultant met the criteria for independence. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Human Resources Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Human Resources Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in our Proxy Statement for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Each unit that the employee purchases is paid out in the form of a share of AT&T stock at the time elected by the employee, along with applicable matching shares. The value of the matching contributions made during the relevant year is included under “All Other Compensation.” A description of the Stock Purchase and Deferral Plan may be found on page 69. Salary changes are effective March 1. NOTE 2. Amounts in the Stock Awards column for 2023 represent the grant date values of Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units. The grant date values of Performance Shares included in the table for 2023 were: Mr. Stankey—$12,375,000; Mr. Desroches—$5,625,000; Ms. Lee—$3,843,760; Mr. McAtee—$5,250,000; and Mr. McElfresh—$6,750,000. The number of Performance Shares distributed at the end of the performance period is dependent upon the achievement of performance goals. Depending upon such achievement, the potential payouts range from 0% of the target number of Performance Shares to a maximum payout of 200% of the target number of Performance Shares. The value of the awards (Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units) will be further affected by the price of AT&T stock at the time of distribution. The grant date values were determined pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 718. Assumptions used for determining the value of the stock awards reported in these columns are set forth in the relevant AT&T Annual Report to Stockholders in Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Share-Based Payments.” AT&T INC. 58 2024 PROXY Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES NOTE 3. Under this column, we report earnings on deferrals of salary and incentive awards to the extent the earnings exceed a market rate specified by SEC rules. For the NEOs, these amounts are as follows for 2023: Mr. Stankey—$4,025, Mr. Desroches—$0, Ms. Lee—$0, Mr. McAtee—$0, and Mr. McElfresh—$6,728. Other amounts reported under this heading represent an increase, if any, in actuarial value of the accumulated pension benefits during the reported period. NOTE 4. This column includes personal benefits, Company-paid life insurance premiums and Company matching contributions to deferral plans. AT&T does not provide tax reimbursements to Executive Officers except under the Company’s relocation plan. In valuing personal benefits, AT&T uses the incremental cost of the benefits to the Company. To determine the incremental cost of aircraft usage, we multiply the number of hours of personal flight usage (including “deadhead” flights) by the hourly cost of fuel (Company average) and the hourly cost of maintenance (where such cost is based on hours of use), and we add per flight fees such as landing, ramp and hangar fees, catering, and crew travel costs. Mr. Stankey reimbursed the Company for the incremental cost of his personal use of Company aircraft. Mr. McAtee’s amount shown for use of Company aircraft represents flights taken for medical treatments.

All of the NEOs except for Mr. McAtee were retirement eligible as of the grant date. Mr. McAtee became retirement eligible on November 27, 2023. Narrative to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table Mr. Stankey The 2018 Incentive Plan provides that in the event an employee retires while retirement eligible under the plan, an award of Performance Shares will be prorated based on the number of months worked during the performance period. AT&T has provided that Performance Shares granted after September 28, 2017 to Mr. Stankey will not be prorated if he remains employed through December 30, 2020, or in the event of certain changes in his reporting. As a result of this provision, Mr. Stankey’s current and future Performance Share grants will not be prorated. Upon closing of the acquisition of WarnerMedia, Mr. Stankey was appointed CEO of Warner Media, LLC. As part of this position, he engaged in extensive business travel, which required him to file state and local income tax returns in a number of jurisdictions.

Mr. McAtee’s 2020 grant of Restricted Stock Units vests in April 2030. NOTE 2. Performance Shares are distributed after the end of the performance period shown for each award. The actual number of shares distributed is dependent upon the achievement of the related performance objectives and approval of the Committee. In this column, we report the number of outstanding Performance Shares and their theoretical value based on the price of AT&T stock on December 31, 2023. In calculating the number of Performance Shares and their value, we are required by SEC rules to compare the Company’s performance through 2023 for each outstanding Performance Share grant against the threshold, target, and maximum performance levels for the grant and report in this column the applicable potential payout amount. If the performance is between levels, we are required to report the potential payout at the next highest level. For example, if the previous fiscal year’s performance exceeded target, even if it is by a small amount and even if it is highly unlikely that we will pay the maximum amount, we are required by SEC rules to report the awards using the maximum potential payouts. The performance measures for the 2022 and 2023 grants are 50% ROIC and 50% EPS Growth with a payout adjustment for the relative TSR modifier. As of the end of 2023, for the 2022 grant the ROIC achievement was above target, the EPS Growth achievement was below target and the TSR modifier was in the third quartile. As a result, the 2022 grant was reported based on the weighted achievement result for ROIC at the maximum payout and EPS Growth at target with a 0% payout adjustment for the relative TSR modifier. For the 2023 grant the ROIC achievement was above target, the EPS Growth achievement was above target and the TSR modifier was in the fourth quartile. As a result, the 2023 grant was reported based on the weighted achievement result for ROIC and EPS Growth at the maximum payout with a -20% payout adjustment for the relative TSR modifier. 2024 PROXY 61 AT&T INC.

Pension benefits reflected in the above table were determined using the methodology and material assumptions set forth in the 2023 AT&T Annual Report to Stockholders in Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Pension and Postretirement Benefits,” except that, as required by SEC regulations, the assumed retirement age is the specified normal retirement age in the plan unless the plan provides a younger age at which benefits may be received without a discount based on age, in which case the younger age is used. For the Nonbargained Program under the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan and the Pension Benefit Make Up Plan, the assumed retirement age is the date a participant is at least age 55 and meets the “modified rule of 75,” which requires certain combinations of age and service that total at least 75. For the Mobility Program, Southeast Management Program and the Management Cash Balance Program under the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan, the assumed retirement age for the cash balance formula is age 65. For the WarnerMedia Component Part and WarnerMedia, LLC Excess Benefit Pension Plan, the assumed retirement age is the date a participant attains age 62. For the AT&T SRIP and its successor, the 2005 SERP, the assumed retirement age for active employees as of 12/31/2023 is the earlier of the date the participant (i) reaches age 60, (ii) attains 30 years of service (when an employee may retire without discounts for age), or (iii) has pension accruals frozen, though not earlier than the 12/31/2023 measurement date. The SRIP/SERP benefits have been reduced for benefits available under the qualified plans and by a specified amount that approximates benefits available under other nonqualified plans included in the table. 2024 PROXY 63 AT&T INC. Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN The AT&T Pension Benefit Plan (the “Plan”), a “qualified pension plan” under the Internal Revenue Code, provides ongoing pension accruals to most of our employees hired before 2015, including each NEO, except Mr. Desroches. Mr. Desroches has a frozen vested pension benefit under the Plan due to his pre-2010 employment at Time Warner, but he no longer earns additional pension benefits. The applicable benefit accrual formula depends on the subsidiaries that have employed the participant. Effective January 1, 2015, no new AT&T management employees are eligible for a pension (2016 for DirecTV). However, employees who are not entitled to participate in the pension plan, or whose pension benefits were frozen, receive an enhanced 401(k) benefit. Nonbargained Program Mr. Stankey and Ms. Lee are covered by the Nonbargained Program of the Plan, which is offered to most of our pre-2007 management employees. Participants in the Nonbargained Program receive the greater of the benefit determined under the CAM formula or the cash balance formula, each of which is described below. Career Average Minimum (CAM) Formula For each of the participating NEOs, the greater benefit comes from the CAM formula, which is reported in the Pension Benefits table. The CAM formula provides an annual benefit equal to 1.6% of the participant’s average pension-eligible compensation (generally, base pay, commissions, and annual bonuses, but not officer bonuses paid to individuals promoted to officer level before January 1, 2009) for the five years ended December 31, 1999, multiplied by the number of years of service through the end of the December 31, 1999, averaging period, plus 1.6% of the participant’s pension-eligible compensation for each year from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2021, and 1% of participant’s pension-eligible compensation for each year thereafter. Employees who meet the “modified rule of 75” and are at least age 55 are eligible to retire without age or service discounts. The “modified rule of 75” establishes retirement eligibility when certain combinations of age and service total at least 75. Cash Balance Formula The cash balance formula was frozen, except for interest credits, on January 14, 2005. The cash balance formula provided an accrual equal to 5% of pension-eligible compensation plus monthly interest credits on the participant’s cash balance account. The interest rate is reset quarterly and is equal to the published average annual yield for the 30-year Treasury Bond as of the middle month of the preceding quarter. The Nonbargained Program permits participants to take the benefit in various actuarially equivalent forms, including various forms of life annuities. For participants terminating on or after May 25, 2018, and receiving their benefit on or after June 1, 2018, this program permits participants to elect to take the benefit in a full lump sum calculated as the present value of the annuity. Management Cash Balance (MCB) Program Mr. McAtee is covered by the MCB Program of the Plan, which is offered to our management employees hired on or after January 1, 2007 (January 1, 2006 for AT&T Mobility) and before January 1, 2015. After completing one year of service, participants in the MCB Program are entitled to receive a cash balance benefit equal to the monthly credit of an age graded basic credit formula ranging from 1.75% to 4% of the participant’s pension-eligible compensation and a 2% supplemental credit for eligible compensation in excess of Social Security Wage Base plus monthly interest credit at an effective annual rate of 4.5% to the participant’s cash balance account. This program permits participants to take the benefit in various actuarially equivalent forms, including an annuity or a lump sum. Mobility Program and Southeast Management Program Mr. McElfresh is covered by the Mobility Program, which is also part of the tax-qualified Plan. This program covers employees of AT&T Mobility that were hired prior to 2006. The Mobility Program is the qualified pension plan previously offered by AT&T Mobility that was merged into the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan. Participants in the Mobility Program are generally entitled to receive a cash balance benefit equal to the monthly basic benefit credits of 5% of the participant’s pension-eligible compensation (generally, base pay, commissions, and group incentive awards, but not individual awards) plus AT&T INC. 64 2024 PROXY Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES monthly interest credits on the participant’s cash balance account. The interest rate for cash balance credits is reset quarterly and is equal to the published average annual yield for the 30-year Treasury Bond as of the middle month of the preceding quarter. The plan permits participants to take the benefit in various actuarially equivalent forms, including an annuity or a lump sum equal to the cash balance account. In addition, Mr. McElfresh has a pension benefit under the Southeast Management Program, also part of the Plan. This benefit accrued during his prior employment period at BellSouth. Going forward, this cash balance account earns only interest credits. The interest crediting rate is reset each calendar-year and is equal to the published average annual yield for the 30-year Treasury Bond as of November of preceding year, but not less than the floor of 3.79%. WarnerMedia Component Part Mr. Desroches has a pension benefit under the WarnerMedia Component of the Plan, which was accrued during his employment at Time Warner. Benefit accruals under this Program were frozen December 31, 2013. After such date, the participant’s age and service continue to count only for purposes of determining early retirement factors and retirement eligibility. NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS To the extent the Internal Revenue Code places limits on the amounts that may be earned under a qualified pension plan, managers who are currently accruing pension benefits instead receive these amounts under the nonqualified Pension Benefit Make Up Plan but only for periods prior to the person becoming a participant in the SRIP/SERP, described below. The Pension Benefit Make Up Plan benefit is paid in the form of a 10-year annuity or in a lump sum if the present value of the annuity is less than $50,000. Mr. Desroches has a frozen benefit under the nonqualified WarnerMedia Excess Pension Benefit Plan (which is provided by Warner Bros. Discovery). His benefit will be paid in the form of monthly payments over a ten-year period. In addition, we offer our Executive Officers and other officers (who became officers prior to 2005) supplemental retirement benefits under the SRIP and, for those serving as officers between 2005-2008, its successor, the 2005 SERP, as additional retention tools. As a result of changes in the tax laws, beginning December 31, 2004, participants ceased accruing benefits under the SRIP, the original supplemental plan. After December 31, 2004, benefits are earned under the SERP. Participants make separate distribution elections (annuity or lump sum) for benefits earned and vested before 2005 (under the SRIP) and for benefits accrued during and after 2005 (under the SERP). Elections for the portion of the pension that accrued in and after 2005, however, must have been made when the officer first participated in the SERP, subject to certain exceptions not applicable to any Executive Officers. Vesting in the SERP requires five years of service (including four years of participation in the SERP). Each of the eligible NEOs is vested in the SERP. Regardless of the payment form, no benefits under the SERP are payable until six months after termination of employment. An officer’s benefits under these nonqualified pension plans are reduced by: (1) benefits due under qualified AT&T pension plans and (2) a specific amount that approximates the value of the officer’s benefit under other nonqualified pension plans, determined generally as of December 31, 2008. These supplemental benefits are neither funded by nor are a part of the qualified pension plan. Mr. Stankey and Ms. Lee are eligible to receive SRIP/SERP benefits. Since January 1, 2009, no new officer has been permitted to participate in the SERP. Calculation of Benefit Under the SRIP/SERP, the target annual retirement benefit is stated as a percentage of a participant’s annual salary and annual incentive bonus averaged over a specified period described below. The percentage is increased by 0.715% for each year of actual service in excess of, or decreased by 1.43% (0.715% for mid-career hires) for each year of actual service below, 30 years of service. In the event the participant retires before reaching age 60, a discount of 0.5% for each month remaining until the participant attains age 60 is applied to reduce the amount payable under this plan, except for officers who have 30 years or more of service at the time of retirement. Of the current NEO SERP participants, only Ms. Lee has an age or service discount under this plan at this time, and her discount will not change due to age or service after December 31, 2022 because of the benefit freeze described below. These benefits are also reduced by any amounts participants receive under AT&T qualified pension plans and by a frozen, specific amount that approximates the amount they receive under our other nonqualified pension plans, calculated as if the benefits under these plans were paid in the form of an immediate annuity for life. 2024 PROXY 65 AT&T INC. Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES The salary and bonus used to determine the SRIP/SERP benefit amount is the average of the participant’s salary and actual annual incentive bonuses earned during the 36-consecutive-month period that results in the highest average earnings that occurs during the 120 months preceding retirement. In some cases, the Committee may require the use of the target bonus, or a portion of the actual or target bonus, if it believes the actual bonus is not appropriate. Effective June 16, 2018 for Mr. Stankey, the annual earnings used in the SERP’s “highest average earnings” is fixed at $3.0 million. The target annual retirement percentage for Mr. Stankey is 60% and 50% for Ms. Lee. Beginning in 2006, the target percentage was limited to 50% for all new participants (see note above on limiting new participants after 2008). If a benefit payment under the plan is delayed by the Company to comply with Federal law, the delayed amounts will earn interest at the rate the Company uses to accrue the present value of the liability, and the interest will be included in the appropriate column(s) in the “Pension Benefits” table. Mr. Stankey’s Benefits Mr. Stankey’s SERP benefits were modified in 2019. For purposes of calculating his SERP benefits, the Company froze his compensation and stopped accruing age and service credits as of December 31, 2019, at which time his benefit was determined as a lump sum amount, which thereafter earns interest. The discount rate for calculating the lump sum as well as the interest crediting rate is 3.7%. Ms. Lee’s Benefit Ms. Lee’s SERP benefit was similarly frozen December 31, 2022, when future compensation, age and service credits ceased. Her benefit was determined as a lump sum amount, which thereafter earns interest. The discount rate for calculating the lump sum as well as the interest crediting rate is 2.3%. Forms of Payment Annuity Participants may receive benefits as an annuity payable for the greater of the life of the participant or ten years. If the participant dies within ten years after leaving the Company, then payments for the balance of the ten years will be paid to the participant’s beneficiary. Alternatively, the participant may elect to have the annuity payable for life with 100% or 50% payable upon his or her death to his or her beneficiary for the beneficiary’s life. The amounts paid under each alternative (and the lump sum alternative described below) are actuarially equivalent. As noted above, separate distribution elections are made for pre-2005 benefits and 2005 and later benefits. Lump Sum Participants may elect to receive upon retirement at age 55 or later, the actuarially determined net present value of the benefit as a lump sum, rather than in the form of an annuity. To determine the net present value, we use the discount rate used for determining the projected benefit obligation at December 31 of the second calendar year prior to the year of retirement. Participants may also elect to take all or part of the net present value over a fixed period of years elected by the participant, not to exceed 20 years, earning interest at the same discount rate. A participant is not permitted to receive more than 30% of the net present value of the benefit before the third anniversary of the termination of employment, unless he or she is at least 60 years old at termination, in which case the participant may receive 100% of the net present value of the benefit as early as six months after the termination of employment. Eligible participants electing to receive more than 30% of the net present value of the benefit within 36 months of their termination must enter into a written noncompetition agreement with us and agree to forfeit and repay the lump sum if they breach that agreement. OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The NEOs who retire after age 55 with at least five years of service (10 years of service for NEOs hired on or after October 1, 2015) or who are retirement eligible under the “modified rule of 75” continue to receive the benefits shown in the following table after retirement. Benefits that are available generally to managers are omitted from the table. All the NEOs are currently retirement eligible. Financial counseling benefits will be made available to the Executive Officers for 36 months following retirement or, in the event of the Executive Officer’s death, to the surviving spouse for one year after death, whichever occurs first. We do not reimburse taxes on personal benefits for Executive Officers, other than certain non-deductible relocation costs, which along with the tax reimbursement, we make available to nearly all management employees. In addition, we also provide communications, broadband, video and related services and products; however, to the extent the service is provided by AT&T, it is typically provided at little or no incremental cost. These benefits are subject to amendment. AT&T INC. 66 2024 PROXY Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS Personal Benefit Estimated Amount (valued at our incremental cost) Financial counseling Maximum of $14,000 per year for 36 months Financial counseling provided in connection with retirement Maximum of $20,000 total Estate planning Maximum of $10,000 per year for 36 months Communication benefits Average of $6,000 for annual programming In the event of the officer’s death, the officer’s unvested Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock, if any, will vest, and outstanding Performance Shares will pay out at 100% of target. As a result, if an active NEO had died at the end of 2023, the amounts of Restricted Stock Units and/or Restricted Stock, as applicable, that would have been vested and distributed include: Mr. McAtee—$6,247,093 and Mr. McElfresh—$1,081,421. If an active NEO had died at the end of 2023, the amounts of Performance Shares that would have distributed are as follows: Mr. Stankey—$18,978,197; Mr. Desroches —$9,494,695; Ms. Lee—$6,742,725; Mr. McAtee—$8,766,224; and Mr. McElfresh—$12,030,337. In addition, in the event of termination of employment due to disability, unvested Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock, if any, will also vest; however, Restricted Stock Units will not pay out until their scheduled vesting distribution times. End-of-year amounts for Messrs. McAtee and McElfresh and are shown above. Conversely, Performance Shares will not be accelerated in the event of a termination due to disability but will be paid without proration, based solely on the achievement of the pre-determined performance goals. We pay recoverable premiums on split-dollar life insurance that provides a specified death benefit to beneficiaries of each NEO. The benefit is equal to one times salary during the officer’s employment, except for the CEO who receives two times salary. After retirement, for officers who first participated beginning in 1998, the death benefit remains one times salary until he or she reaches age 66; the benefit is then reduced by 10% each year until age 70, when the benefit becomes one-half of his or her final salary. In addition to the foregoing, each of the active NEOs purchased optional additional split-dollar life insurance coverage equal to two times salary, which is subsidized by the Company. If the policies are not fully funded upon the retirement of the officer, we continue to pay our portion of the premiums until they are fully funded. The officer’s premium obligation ends at age 65. 2024 PROXY 67 AT&T INC.

AT&T INC. 68 2024 PROXY Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES STOCK PURCHASE AND DEFERRAL PLAN (SPDP) Under the SPDP and its predecessor plan, mid-level managers and above may annually elect to defer up to 30% of their salary and annual bonus. Officers, including the eligible NEOs, may defer up to 95% of their short-term award, which is similar to, and paid in lieu of, the annual bonus paid to other management employees. In addition, the Committee may approve other contributions to the plan. Contributions are made through payroll deductions and are used to purchase AT&T deferred share units (each representing the right to receive a share of AT&T stock) at fair market value on a tax-deferred basis. Participants receive a 20% match in the form of additional deferred share units; however, with respect to short-term awards, officer level participants receive the 20% match only on the purchase of deferred share units that represent no more than their target awards. In addition, the Company provides “makeup” matching contributions in the form of additional deferred share units in order to generally offset the loss of match in the 401(k) plan caused by participation in the SPDP and the CDP, and to provide match on compensation that exceeds Federal compensation limits for 401(k) plans. The makeup match is an 80% match on contributions from the first 6% of salary and bonus (the same rate as used in the Company’s principal 401(k) plan), reduced by the amount of matching contributions the employee is eligible to receive (regardless of actual participation) in the Company’s 401(k) plan. (For certain managers hired after January 1, 2015, the 401(k) match and SPDP/CDP makeup match is 133-1/3% on contributions from the first 3% of salary and bonus and 100% for the next 3%.) Officer level employees do not receive a makeup match on the contribution of their short-term awards. Deferrals are distributed in AT&T stock at times elected by the participant. CASH DEFERRAL PLAN (CDP) Managers who defer at least 6% of salary in the SPDP may also defer up to 50% (25% in the case of mid-level managers) of salary into the CDP. Similarly, managers that defer 6% of bonuses in the SPDP may also defer bonuses in the CDP, subject to the same deferral limits as for salary; however, officer level managers may defer up to 95% of their short-term award into the CDP without a corresponding SPDP deferral. In addition, the Committee may approve other contributions to the plan. We pay interest at the Moody’s Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield Average for the preceding September (the Moody’s rate ), a common index used by companies. Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, we include in the “Summary Compensation Table” under “Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings” any earnings on deferred compensation that exceed a rate determined in accordance with SEC rules. Deferrals are distributed at times elected by the participant. Similarly, under its predecessor plan, managers could defer salary and incentive compensation to be paid at times selected by the participant. No deferrals were permitted under the prior plan after 2004. Account balances in the prior plan are credited with interest at a rate determined annually by the Company, which will be no less than the prior September Moody’s rate. WARNERMEDIA EMPLOYEE SUPPLEMENTAL SAVINGS PLAN (SSP) Mr. Desroches is the only NEO with a balance in the SSP. This nonqualified restoration savings plan allowed U.S. salaried WarnerMedia employees who earned eligible cash compensation in excess of the IRS compensation limit for tax-qualified plans to make additional pre-tax deferrals to notional investment options that mirror most of the 401(k) funds: up to 50% contributions for compensation up to $500,000 and up to 90% for compensation above $500,000. The Company matched contributions up to the first 6% of deferred compensation between the compensation limit and $500,000, with no match for deferred compensation above $500,000. The matching rate was 133-1/3% on the first 3% of amounts deferred and 100% on the next 3% of deferrals, equating to a maximum 7% match up to $500,000 of compensation. 2024 PROXY 69 AT&T INC. Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES AT&T SEVERANCE POLICY Under the AT&T Severance Policy, the Company will not provide severance benefits to an Executive Officer that exceed 2.99 times the officer’s annual base salary, plus target bonus, unless the excess payment receives prior stockholder approval or is ratified by stockholders at a regularly scheduled annual meeting within the following 15 months. POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL Change in Control An acquisition in our industry can take a year or more to complete, and during that time it is critical that the Company have continuity of its leadership. If we are in the process of being acquired, our officers may have concerns about their employment with the new company. Our Change in Control Severance Plan offers benefits so that our officers may focus on the Company’s business without the distraction of searching for new employment. The Change in Control Severance Plan covers our officers, including the NEOs. Description of Change in Control Severance Plan The Change in Control Severance Plan provides an officer who is terminated or otherwise leaves our Company for “good reason” after a change in control a payment equal to 2.99 times the sum of the executive’s most recent salary and target annual bonus for the fiscal year in which the Change in Control occurs. The Company is not responsible for the payment of excise taxes (or taxes on such payments). In 2014, the Company eliminated health, life insurance and financial counseling benefits from the plan. “Good reason” means, in general, assignment of duties inconsistent with the executive’s title or status; a substantial adverse change in the nature or status of the executive’s responsibilities; a reduction in pay; or failure to pay compensation or continue benefits. For the CEO, we eliminated a provision that defined “good reason” to include a good faith determination by the executive within 90 days of the change in control that he or she is not able to discharge his or her duties effectively. Under the plan, a change in control occurs: (a) if anyone (other than one of our employee benefit plans) acquires more than 20% of AT&T’s common stock, (b) if within a two-year period, the Directors at the beginning of the period (together with any new Directors elected or nominated for election by a two-thirds majority of Directors then in office who were Directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease to constitute a majority of the Board, (c) upon consummation of a merger where AT&T Inc. is one of the merging entities and where persons other than the AT&T stockholders immediately before the merger hold more than 50% of the voting power of the surviving entity, or (d) upon our stockholders’ approval of a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all the Company’s assets. If a change in control and a subsequent termination of employment of the NEOs had occurred at the end of 2023 in accordance with the Change in Control Severance Plan, the following estimated severance payments would have been paid in a lump sum.

Table of Contents OTHER INFORMATION DELINQUENT SECTION 16(a) REPORTS AT&T’s Executive Officers and Directors are required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to file reports of transactions and holdings in AT&T common stock with the SEC. Because of the complex nature of the forms, AT&T files the reports on behalf of the Executive Officers and Directors. Based solely on a review of the filed reports made during or with respect to the preceding year, AT&T believes that all Executive Officers and Directors were in compliance with the filing requirements applicable to such Executive Officers and Directors except for six late reports by Ms. Lee covering six transfers of shares to a joint trust (including one transfer that occurred in January 2024), one late report by Mr. Legg covering the vesting and the tax withholding of restricted stock units, one late report by Ms. Sanders covering the tax withholding of restricted stock (which occurred in January 2024), three late reports by Mr. Stankey covering four transfers of shares to a family trust (including one transfer that occurred in January 2024), and one late report by each of Messrs. Arroyo, Gillespie and Legg covering a restricted stock grant (which occurred in January 2024). The untimely reports were the result of administrative errors. COST OF PROXY SOLICITATION The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by AT&T. Officers, agents and employees of AT&T and its subsidiaries and other solicitors retained by AT&T may, by letter, by telephone or in person, make additional requests for the return of proxies and may receive proxies on behalf of AT&T. Brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians will be requested to forward soliciting material to the beneficial owners of shares and will be reimbursed for their expenses. AT&T has retained D. F. King & Co., Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies at a fee of $24,500, plus expenses. CEO PAY RATIO We determined the pay ratio by dividing the total 2023 compensation of the CEO as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table by the total 2023 compensation of the median employee, using the same components of compensation and valuation methodology as used in the Summary Compensation Table for the CEO. The total compensation of our median employee is $137,176. The final pay ratio calculation is 193:1.

Compensation Actually Paid (CAP) is the Summary Compensation Table (SCT) total value for the period shown with adjustments for equity awards and pension. CAP reflects equity awards based on the mark-to-market valuation for cash settled portions of awards under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718: Compensation – Stock Compensation for each period in the above table. Pension values for CAP reflect the pension service cost as used in the financial statements for each period shown in the above table. Note 3. Previously reported CAP for 2020, 2021, and 2022 have been recalculated based on recent guidance from the SEC clarifying that equity awards should be treated as vested in the CAP calculation when the holder achieves retirement eligible status if the awards allow for accelerated vesting when retirement eligibility is satisfied with no other conditions. Note 4. The company must calculate TSR with a base investment of $100 in a manner consistent with the SEC stock performance graph disclosure requirements over the cumulative period covered in the disclosure (i.e., for 2020 the table represents the TSR over 2020, the TSR for 2021 represents the cumulative TSR over 2020 and 2021, etc.). The peer group used for comparison is the S&P 500 Communication Services Index (CSI). Note 5. Standalone AT&T results reflect the historical operating results of the company presented as continuing operations and exclude U.S. Video and other dispositions included in Corporate and Other that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations. Standalone AT&T results are presented to provide 2020 and 2021 full-year results that are comparable to 2022 and 2023 continuing operations financial data. Standalone AT&T Adjusted Operating Income differs from Adjusted Operating Income presented in our quarterly earnings material, and is calculated by adjusting AT&T’s Operating Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations for the following items: (1) transaction, impairment and depreciation and amortization costs associated with merger, acquisition and disposition activity for transactions when enterprise value exceeds $ 2.0 billion; (2) costs related to changes in accounting principles, changes in tax laws, natural disasters, impairments and abandonments of goodwill, other intangibles and fixed assets and, gains and losses related to asset dispositions and mark-to-market activity, in each case, in excess of $ 500 million for 2022 and 2021, and in-excess of $ 300 million for 2023; additionally, for 2023, the actuarial and mark-to-market gains and losses related to the assets and liabilities of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans and rabbi trusts and benefit plan funding that varies from budget; and (3) severance AT&T INC. 74 2024 PROXY Table of Contents OTHER INFORMATION charges in excess of $ 200 million for 2022, and in excess of $ 300 million for 2023.

Dividend equivalents for vested RSUs are not included in equity adjustments for CAP. Prior year Total Equity Award adjustments for 2020, 2021, and 2022 for John Stankey and 2020 adjustments for Randall Stephenson have been recalculated for ease of year-over-year comparison. Note 3. The Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP) was amended in 2020 to freeze Mr. Stankey’s benefit accruals effective 12/31/2019 and convert it to a cash balance account earning annual interest at 3.7% (as disclosed in prior years’ CD&As). This amendment resulted in a one-time Prior Service Cost to account for the change in pension liability. For 2020, the total Pension Cost shown above includes the annual Service Cost (for annual benefit accrual) and this additional Prior Service Cost. Mr. Stankey’s 2021, 2022, and 2023 Pension Costs do not include any Prior Service Cost since there were no applicable plan amendments. In 2021, his qualified management pension increased more than the SERP benefit; it is used as an offset to the gross SERP formula, resulting in a net negative Service Cost for all pension benefits. In 2022, the management pension increased by approximately the same amount that the SERP benefit decreased, resulting in a small positive net Service Cost. 2024 PROXY 75 AT&T INC. Table of Contents OTHER INFORMATION Mr. Stephenson’s 2020 Pension Cost does not include any Prior Service Cost since his SERP benefit was frozen effective 12/31/2012 and the amendment was accounted for in 2013. His management pension increased somewhat more than the amount the SERP benefit decreased during 2020, resulting in a modest positive net Service Cost.

Table of Contents OTHER INFORMATION AT&T INC. 78 2024 PROXY Table of Contents ANNEX A Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures We believe the following measures are relevant and useful information to investors as they are part of AT&T’s internal management reporting and planning processes and are important metrics that management uses to evaluate the operating performance of AT&T and its segments. Management also uses these measures as a method of comparing performance with that of many of our competitors. These measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). We believe this metric provides useful information to our investors because management views free cash flow as an important indicator of how much cash is generated by routine business operations, including capital expenditures and vendor financing, and from our continued economic interest in the U.S. video operations as part of our DIRECTV equity method investment, and makes decisions based on it. Management also views free cash flow as a measure of cash available to pay debt and return cash to shareowners.
