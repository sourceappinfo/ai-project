in its transformation to a global life sciences and diagnostics innovator: • We spun-off our Veralto business (consisting of Danaher’s former water quality and product identification businesses) into an independent, publicly-traded company, further sharpening our strategic focus on life sciences and diagnostics. • We acquired Abcam plc, a leading global supplier of protein consumables, for a cash purchase price of approximately $5.6 billion. Abcam is now included in our Life Sciences segment. Even while meaningfully advancing our strategic
transformation, we: • Continued to invest aggressively in future growth, including investments of approximately $1.5 billion in research and development and $1.4 billion in capital expenditures. • Returned approximately $778 million to common shareholders through cash dividends (marking the 31st year in a row Danaher has paid a dividend on its common shares). • Generated strong financial returns as illustrated below: Long-Term Performance • As of December 31, 2023, out of the 220 companies in the S&P 500 that have been publicly traded since the beginning of 1985, Danaher’s annualized total shareholder return (“TSR”) ranks fourth. • Danaher is the only company in its peer group whose TSR outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 1,600 basis points over every rolling 5-year period from and including 1999-2023. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 4 Back to Contents • Danaher’s compounded average annual shareholder return has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over each of the last five-, ten-, fifteen-, twenty- and twenty-five year periods: Corporate Governance Highlights Our Board of Directors recognizes that Danaher’s
success over the long-term requires a robust framework of corporate governance that serves the best interests of all our shareholders
and promotes robust risk oversight. Below are highlights of our corporate governance framework. Board
    composition is critical, and Danaher continues to seek to
    optimize the mix of skills, traits and tenure represented on
    our Board. Over the past five years our Board has added important
    new skills and traits as average director nominee tenure
    has declined by more than 20%, and more than half of
    the Company’s 2024 director nominees are diverse from a gender
    and/or race/ethnicity perspective. Our
    Bylaws provide for proxy access by shareholders. Our Chairman and CEO positions are separate. Our
    Board has established a Lead Independent Director position. All
    of our directors are elected annually. In
    uncontested elections, our directors must be elected by a majority
    of the votes cast ,
    and we have a director resignation policy that
    applies to any incumbent director who fails to receive
    such a majority. Our
    shareholders have the right to act by written consent. Shareholders
    owning 25% or more of our outstanding shares may call a special meeting of shareholders. We
    have never had a shareholder rights plan. We
    have no supermajority voting requirements in our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. All
    members of our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance
    Committees are independent as defined by the New York Stock Exchange listing
    standards and applicable SEC rules. Danaher
    (including its subsidiaries during the period we have owned
    them) has made no political contributions in the last decade, has no intention of contributing any Danaher
    funds for political purposes, and discloses
    its political expenditures policy on its public
    website. The 2023 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate
    Political Disclosure and Accountability ranked Danaher
    as a First Tier company. Shareholder Engagement Program We actively seek and highly value feedback from
our shareholders. During 2023, in addition to our traditional Investor Relations outreach efforts, we engaged with shareholders
representing approximately 25% of our outstanding shares on topics including our business strategy and financial performance,
governance and executive compensation programs and sustainability initiatives. Attendees included members of our senior management
and, in some cases, members of our Board of Directors. We shared feedback received during these meetings with the applicable Board
committees, informing their decision-making. 2024

        planet • At
        Danaher, innovation doesn’t happen by accident. It is the product of the DBS Innovation Engine, a rigorous, holistic
        management program encompassing tools that facilitate innovation, process, strategy, organization, talent and culture • In
        2023, we also updated our DBS product development tools to explicitly prompt consideration of our customers’ sustainability
        needs at key junctures in the product design, development and launch processes • We
        invested $1.5 billion in research and development in 2023 Building the best team • We
        are committed to attracting, developing, engaging and retaining the best people from around the world to sustain and grow
        our science and technology leadership • Consistently
        attracting and retaining exceptional talent” is one of our three strategic priorities and “The Best Team Wins”
        is one of our five Core Values • In
        2023, we increased female representation in our global workforce to 40% and U.S. People of Color (POC) representation
        to 42% Protecting our environment • In
        2022, we announced a new target to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50.4% in 2032 vs. 2021.
        In 2024, we further committed to set science-based GHG emission reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets
        initiative (SBTi), including a long-term target to achieve net-zero value chain emissions by no later than 2050 • The
        Danaher Business System continues to be a uniquely powerful system for supporting our decarbonization ambitions. With
        the DBS Energy Management Toolkit as our foundation, in 2023 we developed a suite of domain-specific DBS tools and processes
        to drive efficient progress toward our greenhouse gas reduction goal • In
        2023, we also deployed across our businesses a climate risk and opportunity assessment program based on elements of the
        Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations Executive Compensation Highlights Overview of Executive Compensation Program As discussed in detail under “Compensation
Discussion and Analysis,” with the goal of building long-term value for our shareholders, we have developed an executive
compensation program designed to: • attract and retain executives with the leadership skills, attributes and experience necessary to succeed in an enterprise with Danaher’s size, diversity and global footprint; • motivate executives to demonstrate exceptional personal performance and perform consistently at or above the levels that we expect, over the long-term and through a range of economic cycles; and • link compensation to the achievement of corporate goals that we believe best correlate with the creation of long-term shareholder value. To achieve these objectives our compensation program
combines annual and long-term components, cash and equity, and fixed and variable elements, with a bias toward long-term, performance-based
equity awards tied closely to shareholder returns and subject to significant vesting and/or holding periods. Our executive compensation
program rewards our executive officers when they help increase long-term shareholder value, achieve annual business goals and build
long-term careers with Danaher. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 8 Back to Contents Compensation Governance Our Compensation Committee also recognizes that

the thirteen candidates whom the Board has nominated to serve on the Board of Directors (each of whom currently serves as a director
of the Company), to serve until the 2025 Annual Meeting of shareholders and until their successor is duly elected and qualified.
We extend our gratitude to Mr. Walter G. Lohr, Jr., who will be retiring from our Board as of the 2024 Annual Meeting, for his
years of dedicated service to Danaher. Although as of the date of this Proxy Statement the number of directors is fixed at fourteen,
the Board has adopted a resolution that effective as of the time of the 2024 Annual Meeting, the size of the Board will be reduced
to thirteen. We believe the nominees set forth below have qualifications
consistent with our position as a large, global and diversified science and technology company. We also believe these nominees
have the experience and perspective to guide Danaher as we seek to sustainably expand our business in high-growth geographies and
high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated
new products and services, adjust to rapidly changing technologies, business cycles and competition and address the demands of
an increasingly regulated environment. Set forth below is biographical information regarding each candidate as of March 15, 2024. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of
persons than the thirteen nominees named in this Proxy Statement. In the event a nominee declines or is unable to serve, the proxies
may be voted in the discretion of the proxy holders for a substitute nominee designated by the Board, or the Board may reduce the
number of directors to be elected. We know of no reason why this will occur. Director Nominees Rainer M.

    BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR EACH OF THE FOREGOING
    NOMINEES. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 17 Back to Contents Board Selection and Refreshment Director Selection The Board and its Nominating and Governance Committee
believe that it is important that our directors demonstrate: • personal and professional integrity and character; • prominence and reputation in the director’s profession; • skills, expertise and background (including business or other relevant experience) that in aggregate
are useful and appropriate in overseeing and providing strategic direction with respect to Danaher’s business and serving the long-term
interests of Danaher’s shareholders; • the capacity and desire to represent the interests of the shareholders as a whole; and • availability to devote sufficient time to the affairs of Danaher. The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible
for recommending to the Board a slate of nominees for election at each annual meeting of shareholders. Nominees may be suggested by directors,
members of management, shareholders or by a third-party search firm engaged by the Committee. The Committee considers a wide range of
factors when assessing potential director nominees. This includes consideration of the current composition of the Board, any perceived
need for one or more particular areas of expertise, the balance of management and independent directors, the need for committee-specific
expertise, evaluations of other prospective nominees and the qualifications of each potential nominee relative to the attributes, skills
and experience described above. When Danaher recruits a director candidate, either a
search firm engaged by the Committee or a member of the Board contacts the prospect to assess interest and availability. The candidate
will then meet with members of the Board and at the same time, the Committee with the support of the search firm will conduct such further
inquiries as the Committee deems appropriate. A background check is completed before a final recommendation is made to appoint a candidate
to the Board. A shareholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee
for the Board should notify the Nominating and Governance Committee in writing using the procedures described below under “Other
Information – Communications with the Board of Directors” with whatever supporting material the shareholder considers appropriate.
If a prospective nominee has been identified other than in connection with a director search process initiated by the Committee, an initial
determination is made as to whether to conduct a full evaluation of the candidate based primarily on whether a new or additional Board
member is necessary or appropriate at such time, the likelihood that the prospective nominee can satisfy the evaluation factors described
above, any additional inquiries the Committee may, in its discretion, conduct and any other factors the Committee may deem appropriate. Director Nominee Skills, Expertise, and Diversity Diversity is an important consideration in the Board’s
decision-making with respect to Board composition. The Board does not have a formal or informal policy with respect to diversity but believes
that the Board, taken as a whole, should embody a diverse set of skills, knowledge, experiences and backgrounds appropriate in light of
the Company’s needs, and in this regard also subjectively takes into consideration the diversity (including with respect to age,
race, gender, national origin and U.S. military veteran status) of the Board when considering director nominees. More than half of the Company’s director nominees
for the 2024 annual meeting are diverse from a gender and/or race/ethnicity perspective, two nominees are U.S. military veterans, and
our nominees represent a broad range of ages and national origins. 2024

    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 19 Back to Contents Board Orientation Our new director orientation program includes extensive
meetings with Danaher management and familiarizes new directors with Danaher’s businesses, strategies, policies and the Danaher
Business System; assists them in developing company and industry knowledge to optimize their Board service; and educates them with respect
to their fiduciary duties and legal responsibilities and Danaher’s sustainability framework. Director Commitments As noted above and as stated in our Corporate Governance
Guidelines, among other criteria required to serve on the Danaher Board, Danaher directors must have availability to devote sufficient
time to the affairs of the Company. The Guidelines further provide that directors should not serve on more than three boards of public
companies in addition to the Danaher Board, and that directors should advise the Chairman of the Board, the chair of the Nominating and
Governance Committee and the Company Secretary (1) before accepting membership on another board of directors or audit committee or any
other significant committee assignment, or establishing any significant relationship with any business, institution or other governmental
or regulatory entity, and (2) of any other material change in circumstance or relationship that may impact a director’s independence.
Our Nominating and Governance Committee reviews our Corporate Governance Guidelines annually, including the provisions above. As part of our annual Board, committee and individual
director evaluation process (discussed below), our Board has evaluated and determined that each of our directors, including each of our
director nominees, has demonstrated the ability to commit sufficient time and capacity to Board duties and to otherwise fulfill the responsibilities
required of them as Danaher directors. Such ability is evidenced by Board and committee meeting attendance records and preparation, contribution
to Board discussions and decision-making and engagement with other members of the Board and management. Additionally, all of our directors
are in compliance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines relating to limitations on public company board service, as described above. Board Refreshment Our Board actively considers Board refreshment. Using
our Board skills matrix as a guide as well as the results of our annual Board and committee evaluation process (discussed below), the
Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates Board composition at least annually and identifies for Board consideration areas of expertise
that would complement and enhance our current Board. Given the critical role of acquisitions in our overall strategy as well as the diversity
of our portfolio, it is essential that our Board include members with the experience of having led the Company through a range of M&A
and economic cycles. However, the Board also seeks to thoughtfully balance the knowledge and experience that comes from longer-term Danaher
Board service with the fresh perspectives and new domain expertise that can come from adding new directors. We have added five new
directors over the past five years, which along with director retirements have reduced Danaher’s average director nominee tenure by more
than 20% over that period. Proxy Access Our Amended and Restated Bylaws (“Bylaws”)
permit a shareholder, or a group of up to twenty shareholders, owning three percent or more of the Company’s outstanding shares
of Common Stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s annual meeting proxy materials a
number of director nominees up to the greater of (x) two, or (y) twenty percent of the Board (or, if such amount is not a whole number,
the closest whole number below twenty percent), provided that the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in
the Bylaws. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 20 Back to Contents Majority Voting Standard General Our Bylaws provide for majority voting in uncontested
director elections, and our Board has adopted a director resignation policy. Under the policy, our Board will not appoint or nominate
for election to the Board any person who has not tendered in advance an irrevocable resignation effective in such circumstances where
the individual does not receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election and such resignation is accepted by the Board.
If an incumbent director is not elected by a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, our Nominating and Governance Committee
will submit for prompt consideration by the Board a recommendation whether to accept or reject the director’s resignation. The Board
expects the director whose resignation is under consideration to abstain from participating in any decision regarding that resignation. Contested Elections At any meeting of shareholders for which the Secretary
of the Company receives a notice that a shareholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the
Company’s Bylaws and such nomination has not been withdrawn on or before the tenth day before the Company first mails its notice
of meeting to the Company’s shareholders, the directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. This means that the nominees
who receive the most affirmative votes would be elected to serve as directors. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 21 Back to Contents Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Overview Our Board of Directors recognizes that Danaher’s
success over the long-term requires a robust framework of corporate governance that serves the best interests of all our shareholders
and promotes robust risk oversight. Below are highlights of our corporate governance framework. Board composition is critical, and Danaher continues to seek to optimize the
    mix of skills, traits and tenure represented on our Board. Over the past five years our Board has added important new skills and
    traits as average director nominee tenure has declined by more than 20%, and more than half of the Company’s 2024 director
    nominees are diverse from a gender and/or race/ethnicity perspective. Our Bylaws provide for proxy access by shareholders. Our Chairman and CEO positions are separate. Our Board has established a Lead Independent Director position. All of our directors are elected annually. In uncontested elections, our directors must be elected by a majority of the votes cast, and we have a director resignation policy that applies to any incumbent director who fails to receive such a majority. Our shareholders have the right to act by written consent. Shareholders owning 25% or more of our outstanding shares may call a special meeting of shareholders. We have never had a shareholder rights plan. We have no supermajority voting requirements in our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. All members of our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees are independent as defined by the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Danaher (including its subsidiaries during the period we have owned them) has made no political
    contributions in the last decade, has no intention of contributing any Danaher funds for political purposes, and discloses its
    political expenditures policy on its public website. The 2023 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability
    ranked Danaher as a First Tier company. Board Leadership Structure, Succession Planning and
Oversight Board Leadership Structure Chairman of the Board The Board has separated the positions of Chairman and
CEO because it believes that, at this time, this structure best enables the Board to ensure that Danaher’s business and affairs
are managed effectively and in the best interests of shareholders. This is particularly the case in light of the fact that the Company’s
Chairman is Steven Rales, a co-founder of the Company who owns approximately 5.9% of the Company’s outstanding shares, served as
CEO of the company from 1984 to 1990 and continues to serve as an executive officer of the company. As a result of his substantial ownership
stake in the Company, the Board believes that Mr. Rales is uniquely able to understand, articulate and advocate for the rights and interests
of the Company’s shareholders. Moreover, Mr. Rales uses his management experience with the Company and Board tenure to help ensure
that the non-management directors have a keen understanding of the Company’s business as well as the strategic and other risks and
opportunities that the Company faces. This enables the Board to more effectively provide insight and direction to, and exercise oversight
of, the Company’s President and CEO and the rest of the management team responsible for the Company’s day-to-day business
(including with respect to risk management). 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 22 Back to Contents Lead Independent Director Because Mr. Rales is not independent within the meaning
of the NYSE listing standards, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the appointment of a “Lead Independent Director”
and our independent directors have appointed Ms. Filler as Lead Independent Director. As Lead Independent Director, Ms. Filler: • Presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Executive
Committee are not present, including the executive sessions of non-management directors, which are typically held at the end of each regularly
scheduled Board meeting. • Has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors. Ms. Filler has exercised this authority
by typically requiring meetings of the non-management directors at the end of every regularly scheduled Board meeting. • Serves as a liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors. Ms. Filler engages frequently
with Mr. Steven Rales on a range of topics relating to the Board and the Company’s governance program. • Approves information sent to the Board. • Approves meeting agendas for the Board. • Approves meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items. • Engages with major shareholders, including direct communication, as appropriate. Our Board believes that having the same director serve
as both Lead Independent Director and chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee, as Ms. Filler does, offers valuable leadership
synergies. In particular, Ms. Filler’s role leading the annual Board, committee and individual director evaluation process, as chair
of the Nominating and Governance Committee, enhances her Lead Independent Director effectiveness in acting as a liaison between the Chairman
and the independent directors and engaging with the Chairman on governance matters. Board Leadership Succession Planning The Board addresses succession planning for key Board
leadership roles (such as Chairman of the Board, Lead Independent Director and Committee chairs) by seeking to ensure the depth of expertise
on the Board is sufficient to provide appropriate successors in the event of a succession event. Board Oversight Strategy One of the Board’s primary responsibilities is
overseeing management’s development and execution of the Company’s strategy. At least quarterly, the CEO, our executive leadership
team and other business leaders provide detailed business and strategy updates to the Board. The Board annually conducts an even more
in-depth review of the Company’s overall strategy. At these reviews, the Board engages with our executive leadership team and other
business leaders regarding business objectives and the application of DBS, the competitive landscape, economic trends and other developments.
On an annual basis the Board also reviews the Company’s human capital, risk assessment/risk management, compliance and sustainability
programs as well as the Company’s operating budget, and at meetings occurring throughout the year the Board reviews acquisitions,
strategic investments and other capital allocation topics as well as the Company’s operating and financial performance, among other
matters. The Board also looks to the expertise of its committees to inform strategic oversight in their areas of focus. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 23 Back to Contents Spotlight: Oversight
Of Strategic Acquisitions The Board oversees Danaher’s strategic acquisition
and integration process. Danaher views acquisitions as an important element of our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value.
Our Board includes nine members with extensive business combination experience. That depth of experience allows the Board to constructively
engage with management and effectively evaluate acquisitions for alignment with our strategy, culture and financial goals. Management
is charged with identifying potential acquisition targets, executing transactions and managing integration, and our Board’s oversight
extends to each of these elements. Management and the Board regularly discuss potential acquisitions and their role in the Company’s
overall business strategy. These discussions address acquisitions in process and potential future acquisitions, and cover a broad range
of matters which may include valuation, due diligence, risk and anticipated synergies with Danaher’s businesses and strategy. With
respect to more significant acquisitions, such as the Company’s 2020 acquisition of Cytiva, the 2021 acquisition of Aldevron and
the 2023 acquisition of Abcam, the Board typically discusses and evaluates the proposed opportunity over multiple meetings. The Board’s
acquisition oversight also extends across transactions and over time; at least annually the Board reviews and provides feedback regarding
the operational and financial performance of our historical acquisitions. Spotlight: Oversight
Of Human Capital Management and CEO Succession Planning • The
                                            Board and Compensation Committee engage with our senior leadership team and human resources
                                            executives on a regular basis across a range of human capital management topics. As discussed
                                            above, Danaher is committed to attracting, developing, engaging and retaining the best people
                                            from around the world to sustain and grow our science and technology leadership. Working
                                            with management, the Board and Compensation Committee oversee matters including culture,
                                            succession planning and development, compensation, benefits, talent recruiting and retention,
                                            associate engagement and diversity, equity and inclusion. The Board reviews the Company’s
                                            human capital strategy annually and at other times during the year in connection with significant
                                            initiatives and acquisitions, supported by the Compensation Committee’s oversight of
                                            our executive and equity compensation programs. • With
                                            the support of our Nominating and Governance Committee, our Board also maintains and annually
                                            reviews both a long-term succession plan and emergency succession plan for the CEO position. The foundation of the long-term CEO succession planning process is a CEO development
                                            model consisting of three dimensions: critical experiences, leadership capabilities and personal
                                            characteristics/traits. The Board uses the development model as a guide in preparing candidates,
                                            and also in evaluating candidates for the CEO and other executive positions at the Board’s
                                            annual talent review and succession planning session. At the annual session, the Board evaluates
                                            and compares candidates using the development model, and reviews each candidate’s development
                                            actions, progress and performance over time. The candidate evaluations are supplemented with
                                            periodic 360-degree performance appraisals, and the Board also regularly interacts with candidates
                                            at Board dinners and lunches, through Board meeting presentations and at the Company’s
                                            annual leadership conference. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 24 Back to Contents Risk The Board’s role in risk oversight at the Company
is consistent with our leadership structure, with management having day-to-day responsibility for assessing and managing our risk exposure
and the Board and its committees overseeing those efforts, with particular emphasis on the most significant risks facing the Company.
The Board administers its risk oversight responsibilities both through active review and discussion of key risks facing the Company and
by delegating certain risk oversight responsibilities to the Board committees. Generally, the Board delegates risk oversight responsibility
to its committees where it believes the committee’s focused domain expertise will support efficient and effective oversight, and
each committee typically has responsibility with respect to risks that are associated with the purpose of, and responsibilities delegated
to, that committee. Each of the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Science and Technology Committees reports to the full
Board on a regular basis, including as appropriate with respect to the committee’s risk oversight activities. The timeframe over
which the Board and its committees evaluate risk typically varies depending on the nature of the risk. From time to time, the Board and/or
its committees may consider inputs from outside advisors with respect to certain risks and risk trends. With respect to the manner in
which the Board’s risk oversight function impacts the Board’s leadership structure, as described above, our Board believes
that Mr. Steven Rales’ management experience and tenure help the Board to more effectively exercise its risk oversight function. The graphic below summarizes the primary areas of risk
overseen by the Board and by each of its committees. Danaher’s disclosure controls and procedures documentation
specifically references our annual enterprise risk assessment process as an element of our disclosure controls and procedures, and requires
membership overlap between Danaher’s Disclosure Committee and Danaher’s Risk Committee. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 25 Back to Contents Spotlight: Oversight
Of Cybersecurity Risk Danaher’s cybersecurity strategy and risk management
program focuses on maintaining a secure environment for our data that complies with applicable legal requirements and effectively supports
our business objectives and customer needs. Our commitment to cybersecurity emphasizes cultivation of a security-minded culture through
education and training, and a programmatic and layered approach to prevention and detection of, and response to, cybersecurity threats.
Key elements of our program include: • cybersecurity policies that articulate our expectations and requirements with respect to topics such
as acceptable use of technology and data, data privacy, risk management, education and awareness and event and incident management; • regular education of and sharing best practices with our associates to raise awareness of cybersecurity
threats; • assessment of information technology/cybersecurity risks as part of Danaher’s annual Enterprise
Risk Management program; • maintenance of cyber insurance in amounts and subject to coverage terms that are typical for companies
of our type and size (however, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches,
cyber-attacks and other related breaches); and • periodic engagement of external consultants to assess our cybersecurity program. We also strive to implement and maintain layered controls
designed to prevent and, where necessary, detect and respond to cybersecurity threats, including controls designed to facilitate identification
of third-party cybersecurity risks. At the management level, Danaher’s cybersecurity
program is led by the Company’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), who reports to Danaher’s Chief Information
Officer (“CIO”), who in turn reports to Danaher’s Chief Financial Officer. The CISO is supported by the Information
Risk Steering Committee (“IRSC”), a management committee comprising senior members of the information technology, legal, privacy,
finance, internal audit and communications functions. At the Board level, Danaher’s Board of Directors has delegated to the Audit
Committee of the Board responsibility for oversight of risks relating to cybersecurity, as set forth in the Committee’s charter.
Multiple members of Danaher’s Audit Committee have prior work experience overseeing or assessing a cybersecurity function. Danaher’s
CISO and CIO update the Audit Committee multiple times per year regarding Danaher’s cybersecurity program, including key program
metrics, initiatives and developments. The Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these matters. In addition, in the event
of a significant cybersecurity incident, Danaher policy and process requires timely engagement of and consultation with the Audit Committee. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 26 Back to Contents Board of Directors and Committees of the Board General The Board met seven times in 2023. All directors attended
at least 90% (and ten of the directors attended 100%) of the total number of meetings of the Board and of the committees of the
Board on which they served held during the period they served. Danaher typically schedules a Board meeting in conjunction with
each annual meeting of shareholders and as a general matter expects that the members of the Board will attend the annual meeting.
All of our directors at the time attended the Company’s annual meeting in May 2023. The membership of each of the Board’s committees
as of March 8, 2024 is set forth below. While each of the committees is authorized to delegate its powers to sub-committees, none
of the committees did so during 2023. The Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance and Science & Technology Committees
report to the Board on their actions and recommendations at each regularly scheduled Board meeting. Each such committee typically
meets in executive session, without the presence of management, at its regularly scheduled meetings. Name of Director Audit Compensation Nominating and Governance Science & Technology Executive Finance Rainer

        independent under the NYSE listing standards and under Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act. Management Role in Supporting the Compensation
Committee: Members of our senior management generally attend
the Compensation Committee meetings. In addition, our CEO: • provides background regarding the interrelationship
    between our business objectives and executive compensation matters and advises on the alignment of incentive plan performance
    measures with our overall strategy; • participates in the Committee’s discussions
    regarding the performance and compensation of the other executive officers and provides recommendations to the Committee regarding
    all significant elements of compensation paid to such officers, their annual, personal performance objectives and his evaluation
    of their performance (the Committee gives considerable weight to our CEO’s evaluation of and recommendations with respect
    to the other executive officers because of his direct knowledge of each such officer’s performance and contributions);
    and • provides feedback regarding the companies
    that he believes Danaher competes with in the marketplace and for executive talent. Our human resources and legal departments also assist
the Committee Chair in scheduling and setting the agendas for the Committee’s meetings, preparing meeting materials and providing
the Committee with data relating to executive compensation as requested by the Committee. Independent Compensation Consultant Role in Supporting
the Compensation Committee: Under the terms of its charter, the Committee has
the authority to engage the services of outside advisors and experts. The Committee has engaged Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc.
(“FW Cook”) as its independent compensation consultant since 2008. The Committee engages FW Cook because it is considered
one of the premier independent compensation consulting firms and has never provided any services to the Company other than the
compensation-related services provided to or at the direction of the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee.
FW Cook takes its direction solely from the Committee (and with respect to matters relating to the non-management director compensation
program, the Nominating and Governance Committee). In addition to the director compensation advice provided to the Nominating and
Governance Committee, FW Cook’s primary responsibilities in 2023 were to: • provide advice and data in connection with
    the structuring of the executive and equity compensation programs and the compensation levels for the Company’s executive
    officers compared to their peers; • assess the Company’s executive compensation
    program in the context of compensation governance best practices; • update the Committee regarding legislative
    and regulatory initiatives as well as emerging trends and investor views in the area of executive compensation; • provide data regarding the share dilution
    costs attributable to the Company’s aggregate equity compensation program; • assist in the review of the Company’s
    executive compensation public disclosures; and • provide advice and data in connection with
    the structuring of the executive and equity compensation programs of Veralto Corporation, which Danaher spun-off as an independent,
    publicly-traded company in 2023 (the “Veralto Spin-Off”), and the compensation levels for the executive officers
    thereof compared to their anticipated peers, as well as general advice relating to executive and equity compensation matters
    related to the Veralto Spin-Off. The Committee does not place any material limitations
on the scope of the feedback provided by FW Cook. In the course of discharging its responsibilities, FW Cook may from time to time
and with the Committee’s consent, request from management information regarding compensation amounts and practices, the interrelationship
between our business objectives and executive compensation matters, the nature of the Company’s executive officer responsibilities
and other business information. The Committee has considered whether the work performed for or at the direction of the Compensation

    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 29 Back to Contents Executive Committee The Executive Committee exercises between meetings
of the Board any powers or authority as are specifically delegated to it by the Board from time to time, typically related to business
acquisition or capital raising transactions. The Executive Committee did not meet in 2023. Finance Committee The Finance Committee approves business acquisitions,
investments and divestitures up to the levels of authority delegated to it by the Board. The Finance Committee met one time in
2023. Board, Committee and Individual Director Evaluations Our Board recognizes that a rigorous and constructive
evaluation process is an essential component of good corporate governance and Board effectiveness. Under the leadership of our
Lead Independent Director, the Nominating and Governance Committee oversees the annual evaluation process and periodically reviews
the format of the process to help ensure it is eliciting actionable feedback with respect to the effectiveness of the Board, Board
committees and individual directors. The annual Board, committee and individual director
evaluation process consists of the following components: 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 30 Back to Contents Shareholder Engagement and Alignment Shareholder Engagement Program General We actively seek and highly value feedback from our
shareholders. During 2023, in addition to our traditional Investor Relations outreach efforts, we engaged with shareholders representing
approximately 25% of our outstanding shares on topics including our business strategy and financial performance, governance and
executive compensation programs and sustainability initiatives. Attendees included members of our senior management and, in some
cases, members of our Board of Directors. We shared feedback received during these meetings with the applicable Board committees,
informing their decision-making. 2023 Shareholder Proposals At Danaher’s 2023 Annual Meeting, a majority
of the shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote voted against: • a shareholder proposal requesting
    adoption of a policy separating the Chair and CEO roles and requiring an independent Board Chair whenever possible. Danaher’s
    Nominating and Governance Committee annually reviews Danaher’s leadership structure, and the proposal, investor feedback
    thereon and the voting results (in 2023 and in the prior years when a similar proposal has been brought) were taken into account
    in considering whether a modification to Danaher’s leadership structure is warranted. It
    was determined that the existing leadership structure (with Steven Rales as executive Chairman and Ms. Filler as Lead Independent
    Director) achieves an appropriate balance of independent leadership and effective management oversight and continues to serve
    the Company and its shareholders well. • a shareholder proposal requesting a report
    to shareholders on the effectiveness of the Company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. As noted in further
    detail in “Proposal 5 – Shareholder Proposal – Company’s Statement in Opposition,” Danaher has
    demonstrated that diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE+I”) is a strategic priority with active support from the
    Board and executive management; has set ambitious DE+I improvement goals and made meaningful progress toward achieving those
    goals; and has been highly transparent in quantifying the performance of its DE+I program. After considering the foregoing
    as well as the voting results for this proposal and the feedback investors have provided on Danaher’s DE+I program,
    Danaher determined that the proponent’s request would be inefficient and costly without adding significant value to
    our shareholders. Key Policies Aligning Company and Shareholder Interests • Director and Executive Officer Stock Ownership Requirements . Our Board has adopted
    stock ownership requirements for non-management directors. Under the requirements, each non-management director (within five
    years of their initial election or appointment) is required to beneficially own Danaher shares with a market value of at least
    five times their annual cash retainer (excluding the additional cash retainers paid to the committee chairs and the Lead Independent
    Director). Once a director has acquired a number of shares that satisfies such ownership multiple, such number of shares then
    becomes such director’s minimum ownership requirement (even if their retainer increases or the fair market value of
    such shares subsequently declines). Under the policy, beneficial ownership includes time-vesting
    restricted stock units (“RSUs”) held by the director, shares in which the director or their spouse or child has
    a direct or indirect interest and phantom shares of Danaher Common Stock in the Non-Employee Directors’ Deferred Compensation
    Plan, but does not include shares subject to unexercised stock options or pledged shares. Each Danaher director is in compliance
    with the policy. We have also adopted stock ownership requirements for our executive officers; please see “Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis – Stock Ownership-Related Policies.” • Clawback Policies . We have rigorous, “no-fault” compensation clawback
    policies that apply to executive officers and other senior leaders. For additional details, please see “Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis—Clawback Policies.” • Anti-Pledging/Hedging Policy . In 2013 Danaher’s Board adopted a policy that
    prohibits any director or executive officer from pledging as security under any obligation any shares of Danaher Common Stock
    that the director or officer directly or indirectly owns and controls, except for any shares that were pledged as of the date
    the policy was adopted. Certain shares of Common Stock owned by Steven Rales and by Mitchell Rales were exempted from the
    policy because such shares had been pledged for decades, to secure lines of credit that reduce the need to sell shares for
    liquidity purposes. Messrs. Steven and Mitchell Rales 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 31 Back to Contents acquired these pledged shares in cash purchase
    transactions between 1983 and 1988 and did not receive them as compensation or purchase them from Danaher. These pledged shares
    do not count toward the Company’s stock ownership requirements. Notwithstanding that these shares are exempted from
Danaher’s policy, as part of its risk oversight function the Audit Committee of Danaher’s Board reviews these share
pledges on a quarterly basis to assess whether such pledging poses an undue risk to the Company. The Committee has concluded that
such pledge arrangements do not pose an undue risk to the Company, based in particular on its consideration of the following factors: • the amount by which the market value of the shares pledged as collateral exceeds the amount of secured indebtedness, which the Committee believes is a key factor in assessing the degree of risk posed by the pledging arrangements. At December 31, 2023, the maximum amount of secured indebtedness permitted under the lines of credit would not exceed 25% of the market value of the shares pledged as collateral; • the number of shares and percentage of total outstanding shares pledged; • the more than 15% reduction since 2013 in the aggregate number of shares pledged by Messrs. Steven Rales and Mitchell Rales; and • the number of days it would take to unwind the number of pledged shares equal in value to the amount of secured indebtedness outstanding at the end of the applicable calendar year (based on the average daily trading volume of Danaher common stock during such calendar year). • At each of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,
    to unwind the number of pledged shares equal in value to the amount of secured indebtedness outstanding as of such date under
    lines of credit maintained by Mitchell Rales or Steven Rales would have required one day or less. From 2021 through 2023, members of Danaher’s
Board and management engaged regarding the pledge arrangements with shareholders representing more than 25% of Danaher’s
outstanding common shares, and at Danaher’s 2023 Annual Meeting a significant majority of these shares were voted in favor
of our Audit Committee members. During these discussions with investors, we answered questions and using the detail set forth above
explained the reasons why the Audit Committee believes it is in the best interest of Danaher and its shareholders to allow such
pledging arrangements subject to rigorous Audit Committee oversight. Additionally, we have incorporated input received from these
investor engagements into the above disclosures. Danaher’s Insider Trading Policy also prohibits
Danaher directors and employees (including executive officers) from engaging in short sales of Danaher Common Stock, transactions
in any derivative of a Danaher security (including, but not limited to, buying or selling puts, calls or other options (except
for instruments granted under a Danaher equity compensation plan)) or any other forms of hedging transactions with respect to Danaher
securities. • Shareholder
    Right to Call Special Meeting . Shareholders owning 25% or more of Danaher’s outstanding shares may require the Company
    to call a special meeting of shareholders. For additional information regarding Danaher shareholders’ right to call
    a special meeting, please see “Proposal 4 — Shareholder Proposal — Company’s Statement in Opposition.” Sustainability For an overview of Danaher’s sustainability
program, please see “Proxy Statement Summary – Sustainability.” Corporate Governance Guidelines, Committee Charters
and Code of Conduct As part of its ongoing commitment to good corporate
governance, our Board of Directors has codified its corporate governance practices into a set of Corporate Governance Guidelines
and has also adopted written charters for each of the committees of the Board. Danaher has also adopted a code of business conduct
and ethics for directors, officers (including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting
officer) and employees, known as the Code of Conduct. The Corporate Governance Guidelines, charters of each of the Audit, Compensation
and Nominating and Governance Committees and Code of Conduct are available in the “Investors – Corporate Governance”
section of our website at http://www.danaher.com. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 32 Back to Contents Director Compensation Non-Management Director Compensation Program Non-Management Director Compensation Philosophy We use a combination of cash and equity-based
compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on the Board. In setting director compensation, the Board and
the Nominating and Governance Committee are guided by the following principles: • compensation should fairly pay directors for work required in a company of our size and scope, and differentiate among directors where appropriate to reflect different levels of responsibilities; • a significant portion of the total compensation should be paid in stock-based awards to align directors’ interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders; and • the structure of the compensation program should be simple and transparent. Process for Setting Non-Management Director Compensation The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible
for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding non-management director compensation (although the Board makes
the final determination regarding the amounts and type of non-management director compensation). The Committee engages FW Cook,
the Board’s independent compensation consultant, to prepare regular reports on market non-management director compensation
practices and evaluate our program in light of the results of such reports. The Committee typically reviews, and seeks advice from
FW Cook regarding, the Company’s non-management director compensation on an annual basis. Danaher’s 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”
or the “Omnibus Plan”) limits the amount of cash and equity compensation that we may pay to a non-management director
each year. Under the plan terms, an annual limit of $800,000 per calendar year applies to the sum of all cash and equity-based
awards (calculated based on the grant date fair value of such awards for financial reporting purposes) granted to each non-management
director for services as a member of the Board (plus an additional limit of $500,000 per calendar year with respect to any non-executive
Board chair or vice chair). 2024 Non-Management Director Compensation Structure Director cash retainers are paid quarterly in arrears.
Director annual equity awards are divided equally (based on target award value) between options and RSUs. The options are fully
vested as of the grant date. The RSUs vest upon the earlier of (1) the first anniversary of the grant date, or (2) the date of,
and immediately prior to, the next annual meeting of Danaher’s shareholders following the grant date, but the underlying
shares are not issued until the earlier of the director’s death or the first day of the seventh month following the director’s
retirement from the Board. Danaher also reimburses directors for Danaher-related out-of-pocket expenses, including travel expenses. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 33 Back to Contents Non-Management Directors’ Deferred Compensation
Plan Each non-management director can elect to defer all
or part of the cash director fees that the director earns with respect to a particular year under the Non-Employee Directors’
Deferred Compensation Plan, which is a sub-plan under the Omnibus Plan. Amounts deferred under the plan are converted into a particular
number of phantom shares of Danaher Common Stock, calculated based on the closing price of Danaher’s Common Stock on the
date that such quarterly fees would otherwise have been paid, and are maintained in bookkeeping accounts. Dividends accrued on
phantom shares are also deemed invested in phantom shares of Danaher Common Stock. A director may elect to have their plan balance
distributed upon cessation of Board service, or one, two, three, four or five years after cessation of Board service. All distributions
from the plan are in the form of shares of Danaher Common Stock. Director Summary Compensation Table The table below summarizes the compensation
paid by Danaher to the non-management directors for the year ended December 31, 2023. Each of Steven Rales, Mitchell Rales
and Rainer M. Blair serves as a director and executive officer of Danaher but they have not received and do not receive any
additional compensation for services provided as a director. Neither Steven Rales nor Mitchell Rales is a named executive
officer. Details regarding the 2023 executive compensation provided to each of Steven Rales and Mitchell Rales is set forth

    represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the applicable award computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. With
    respect to stock awards, the grant date fair value under FASB ASC Topic 718 is calculated based on the number of shares of
    Common Stock underlying the award, times the closing price of the Danaher Common Stock on the date of grant (but discounted
    to account for the fact that RSUs do not accrue dividend rights prior to distribution). With respect to stock options, the
    grant date fair value under FASB ASC Topic 718 has been calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, based on
    the following assumptions (and assuming no forfeitures): a 7.0 year option life; a risk-free interest rate of 3.48%; a stock
    price volatility rate of 28.36%; and a dividend yield of 0.48% per share. 2024

Zerhouni, MD. 641 2024 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 35 Back to Contents Director Independence and Related Person Transactions Director Independence At least a majority of the Board must qualify as independent
within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE. The Board has affirmatively determined that Mss. Filler and List, Messrs.
Dewan, Lohr, Sanders, Schwieters and Spoon, Professor Stevens and Drs. Mega and Zerhouni are independent within the meaning of
the listing standards of the NYSE. The Board concluded that none of these directors possesses any of the bright-line relationships
set forth in the listing standards of the NYSE that prevent independence, or except as discussed below, any other relationship
with Danaher other than Board membership. In making its determination with respect to the independence
of the directors identified above as independent, the Board considered that in 2023, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries
sold products and/or services to and purchased products and/or services from organizations with whom certain of the independent
directors (or a member of their immediate family) are or were employed. In each such case, the amount of sales and the amount of
purchases were less than 1.5% of the annual revenues of such other organization and of Danaher’s 2023 revenues. The Board
also considered that all of the transactions referenced in the prior sentence were conducted in the ordinary course of business. Danaher’s non-management directors meet in executive
session following the Board’s regularly-scheduled meetings. The sessions are chaired by the Lead Independent Director. In
addition, at least once each year Danaher’s independent directors meet in executive session following a regularly-scheduled
Board meeting, and the Lead Independent Director chairs such sessions as well. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Policy Under Danaher’s written Related Person Transactions
Policy, the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board is required to review and if appropriate approve all related person
transactions prior to consummation. The Committee is required to review and consider all relevant information available to it about
each related person transaction, and a transaction is considered approved under the policy if the Committee authorizes it according
to the terms of the policy after full disclosure of the related person’s interests in the transaction. Related person transactions
of an ongoing nature are reviewed annually by the Committee. The definition of “related person transactions” for purposes
of the policy covers the transactions that are required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act. Relationships and Transactions Steven and Mitchell Rales receive no cash incentive
compensation or equity awards for their service as executive officers. In 2023, each of Steven and Mitchell Rales received a salary
of $419,000 and was entitled to participate in all of the benefits made generally available to salaried employees as well as all
perquisites made generally available to Danaher’s executive officers. Steven Rales also received a 401(k) plan contribution
of $22,960 and Mitchell Rales received a 401(k) plan contribution of $3,771 and a contribution of $18,806 into his Excess Contribution
Program (“ECP”) account. In 2023, Danaher provided to the Rales’ tax and accounting services at a cost to Danaher
of approximately $340,425 in the form of one full-time employee (plus health and welfare benefits for such employee), allowed the
Rales’ to make personal use of designated Danaher office space at a cost to Danaher of approximately $306,732 and provided
Mr. Steven Rales with a personal car and parking at a cost to Danaher of approximately $3,985. The incremental cost to the Company
of the perquisites set forth above is based on the Company’s out-of-pocket costs. Danaher also provided a full-time executive
assistant to each of the Rales’ to support them in their roles as Danaher executive officers. In each case, their use of
a minority of their assistant’s time for non-Danaher matters resulted in no incremental cost to Danaher. Separately, in 2023,
Steven and Mitchell Rales in aggregate paid Danaher approximately $215,000 for providing benefits for, and as reimbursement for
paying a portion of the salaries of, persons who provide services to the Rales’. 2024 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 36 Back to Contents FJ 900, Inc. (“FJ900”), an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Danaher, is party to an airplane management agreement with Joust Capital II, LLC (“Joust II”) and substantially
identical agreements with each of Joust Capital III, LLC (“Joust III”) and Stonehavens Global LLC (“Stonehavens”
and, together with the Joust II and Joust III, the “Joust entities”). Joust II and Stonehavens are controlled by Mitchell
Rales, and Joust III is controlled by Steven Rales. Under the management agreements, FJ900 performs management services for the
respective aircraft owned or leased by each of the Joust entities in like manner to the management services provided by FJ900 for
Danaher’s aircraft. The management services provided by FJ900 include the provision of aircraft management, pilot services,
maintenance, record-keeping, aircraft procurement and disposition and other aviation services. FJ900 receives no compensation for
its services under the management agreements. Having FJ900 perform management services for all of these aircraft enables Danaher
and the Joust entities to share certain fixed expenses relating to the use, maintenance, storage, operation and supervision of
their respective aircraft and utilize joint purchasing or joint bargaining arrangements where applicable and appropriate, allowing
each party to benefit from efficiencies of scale and cost savings. We believe that this cost-sharing arrangement results in lower
costs to Danaher than if we incurred these fixed costs on a stand-alone basis. Under the management agreements, FJ900 prorates
all shared expenses annually among the Joust entities and Danaher based primarily on each party’s flight hours logged for
the year. The Joust entities pre-pay FJ900 on a quarterly basis for their estimated, prorated portion of such shared expenses,
and the amounts are trued up at the end of the year. With respect to the year ended December 31, 2023, the Joust entities together
paid FJ900 approximately $4.2 million for the Joust entities’ share of the fixed airplane management expenses shared with
Danaher. Each Joust entity pays directly all expenses attributable to its aircraft that are not shared. Under the management agreements,
each party is also required to maintain a prescribed amount of comprehensive aviation liability insurance and name the other party
and its affiliates as additional named insureds, while the Joust entities must also maintain all-risk hull insurance for their
aircraft. If either party suffers any losses in connection with the arrangements set forth in the management agreement, and such
losses are due to the fault, negligence, breach or strict liability of the other party, the sole recourse of the party incurring
the loss against the other party is to the available insurance proceeds. Each management agreement may be terminated by any party
upon 30 days’ notice. In addition, Danaher is party to substantially identical
airplane interchange agreements with each of the Joust entities with respect to each respective aircraft indirectly owned by Danaher
and by each of the Joust entities. Under each interchange agreement, the applicable Joust entity has agreed to lease its aircraft
to Danaher and Danaher has agreed to lease the respective Danaher aircraft to the applicable Joust entity, in each case on a non-exclusive
basis. Neither party is charged for its use of the other party’s aircraft, the intent being that over the life of the contract
each party’s usage of the other party’s aircraft will be generally equal. With respect to the year ended December 31,
2023, the incremental value of the use of the Joust entities’ aircraft by Danaher, net of the incremental value of the use
of the Danaher aircraft by the Joust entities, was approximately $130,000. The owner of each aircraft, as operator of the aircraft,
is responsible for providing a flight crew for all flights operated under the interchange agreement. Each owner/operator is required
to maintain standard insurance, including all-risk hull insurance and a prescribed amount of comprehensive aviation liability insurance,
and to name the other party and its affiliates as additional named insureds. With respect to any losses suffered by the party using
the owner/operator’s plane, the using party’s recourse against the owner/operator is limited to the amount of available
insurance proceeds. To the extent the using party and/or any third party suffers losses in connection with the using party’s
use of the owner/operator’s aircraft in an amount in excess of the insurance proceeds recovered from the owner/operator’s
insurance carrier, the using party will indemnify the owner/operator for all such excess amounts. The interchange agreements may
be terminated by either party upon 10 days’ notice. Danaher licensed, at fair market value, a suite from
the Washington Commanders for the 2023-2024 NFL football season for approximately $560,000. Mitchell Rales is a greater-than-10%
owner of the Washington Commanders. On September 29, 2023, we completed the Veralto Spin-Off.
Following the Veralto Spin-Off, Danaher and Veralto operate as separate publicly-traded companies and neither entity has any ownership
interest in the other. However, in 2023 subsequent to the Spin-Off Steven and Mitchell Rales collectively owned more than 10% of
the equity of Veralto. In connection with the Veralto Spin-Off, Danaher and Veralto entered into various agreements to effect the
transaction and provide a framework for their relationship after the transaction, including a transition services agreement, an
employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement and a license agreement with respect
to the Danaher Business System, or DBS (a proprietary set of business processes and methodologies we use that are designed to continuously
improve business performance). These agreements provide for the allocation between Danaher and Veralto of assets, employees, liabilities
and obligations (including investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to
periods prior to, at and after Veralto’s spin-off from Danaher and govern certain relationships between Danaher and Veralto
after the Veralto Spin-Off. In addition, following the Veralto Spin-Off certain of our subsidiaries sell products and services

the Veralto Spin-Off in 2023 through February 23, 2024, Danaher received approximately $26.8 million in payments from Veralto for
transition services provided to Veralto and paid approximately $80,000 to Veralto for transition services received from Veralto;
and following the Spin-Off in 2023 our subsidiaries sold approximately $735,000 of products and services to Veralto, which is less
than 1% of Veralto’s, and of Danaher’s, revenues for 2023. In addition, there is an outstanding receivable owed from
Veralto to Danaher in the amount of approximately $5.1 million for transition services provided by Danaher. Our subsidiaries intend
to sell products to and purchase products from Veralto in the future in the ordinary course of their businesses and on an arms’-length

    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 40 Back to Contents PROPOSAL 2 Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Audit Committee on behalf of Danaher has selected
Ernst & Young LLP, an international accounting firm of independent certified public accountants, to act as the independent
registered public accounting firm for Danaher and its consolidated subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2024. Representatives
of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if
they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. Although shareholder approval of the selection
of Ernst & Young LLP is not required by law, Danaher’s Board believes that it is advisable to give shareholders
an opportunity to ratify this selection. If this proposal is not approved by Danaher’s shareholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting,
the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection of Ernst & Young LLP. Even if the selection of Ernst & Young
LLP is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at
any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Danaher and its shareholders. THE
    BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION
    OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP TO SERVE AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR DANAHER FOR 2024. Audit Fees and All Other Fees The following table sets forth the fees for audit,

    statements and internal control over financial reporting, reviews of quarterly financial statements, and the services that
    an independent auditor would customarily provide in connection with subsidiary audits, statutory requirements, regulatory

    filed with the SEC. Audit fees also include advice about accounting matters that arose in connection with or as a result of
    the annual audit or the review of quarterly financial statements and statutory audits that non-U.S. jurisdictions
    require. 22,872,502 23,328,284 Audit-Related Fees. Fees for assurance and related
    services reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of financial statements and internal control over financial

        rendered by the independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the fees described above are compatible with maintaining
        such firm’s independence and has concluded that such services do not impair such firm’s independence. Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible
Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditors Under its charter, the Audit Committee must pre-approve
all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for Danaher by the independent registered public accounting
firm. Each year, the Committee approves the independent registered public accounting firm’s retention to audit Danaher’s
financial statements and internal control over financial reporting before the filing of the preceding year’s annual report
on Form 10-K. The Committee also establishes detailed pre-approved categories of non-audit services that may
be performed by the independent auditor during the year, subject to certain monetary limits. With respect to additional non-audit services
by the independent auditors that either are not covered by the pre-approved categories, or exceed the pre-approved monetary
limits, the Committee approves or rejects each engagement. In each case, the Committee takes into account whether the services
are permissible under applicable law and the possible impact of each non-audit service on the independent registered public accounting
firm’s independence from management. The Committee may delegate to a subcommittee of one or more members the authority to
grant preapprovals of audit and permitted non-audit services, and the decisions of such subcommittee to grant preapprovals must
be presented to the full Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Committee has not made any such delegation as of the
date of this Proxy Statement. Audit Committee Report This report is not deemed to be “soliciting material”
or to be “filed” with the SEC or subject to the SEC’s proxy rules or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange
Act of 1934, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any prior or subsequent filing by Danaher under the Securities
Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent Danaher specifically incorporates this report by reference therein. The Audit Committee assists the Board in overseeing
the quality and integrity of Danaher’s financial statements, the effectiveness of Danaher’s internal control over financial
reporting, the qualifications, independence and performance of Danaher’s independent registered public accounting firm, the
performance of Danaher’s internal audit function, Danaher’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, Danaher’s
major financial risk exposures, significant legal, compliance, reputational, climate, cybersecurity and privacy risks and overall
risk assessment and risk management policies, and Danaher’s swaps and derivatives transactions and related policies and procedures. The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the
appointment, compensation and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit Danaher’s
financial statements and has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as Danaher’s independent registered public accounting firm for
2024. The Audit Committee evaluates Ernst & Young’s performance at least annually. In evaluating Ernst & Young and
determining whether to reappoint the firm as Danaher’s independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee
took into consideration a number of factors, including the firm’s tenure, independence, global capability and expertise and
performance. Ernst & Young has been retained as Danaher’s independent registered public accounting firm continuously
since 2002. The Audit Committee periodically considers the advisability and impact of rotating our independent registered public
accountants. In conjunction with the mandated rotation of Ernst & Young’s lead engagement 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 42 Back to Contents partner every five years, the Audit Committee (including
its chair) are directly involved in the selection of Ernst & Young’s new lead engagement partner. The Audit Committee
is also responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with Danaher’s retention of Ernst & Young. Danaher’s
Board of Directors and Audit Committee believe they have undertaken appropriate steps with respect to oversight of Ernst &
Young’s independence and that the continued retention of Ernst & Young to serve as Danaher’s independent registered
public accounting firm is in the best interests of Danaher and its shareholders. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee
has reviewed and discussed with Danaher’s management and Ernst & Young Danaher’s audited consolidated financial
statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed with Ernst &
Young those matters required to be discussed under the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(“PCAOB”) and the SEC. In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst
& Young required by the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit
Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Ernst & Young its independence. The Audit Committee has concluded
that Ernst & Young’s provision of non-audit services as described in the table above is compatible with Ernst & Young’s
independence. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above,
the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements for Danaher for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2023 be included in Danaher’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for filing
with the SEC. Audit Committee of the Board of Directors John T. Schwieters (Chair) Teri List A. Shane Sanders Raymond C. Stevens, PhD 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 43 Back to Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis The following section discusses and analyzes the compensation
provided to each of the executive officers set forth in the summary compensation table below, also referred to as the named executive
officers, or neos. The content of this compensation discussion and analysis is organized into six sections: Table of Contents Executive Summary 44 Risk Considerations 49 Analysis of 2023 Named Executive Officer Compensation 49 Peer Group Compensation Analysis 56 Named Executive Officer Compensation Framework 58 Other Compensation Policies and Information 58 Executive Summary Overview In 2023, Danaher achieved critical milestones in its
transformation into a global life sciences and diagnostics innovator: • We spun-off our Veralto business (consisting of Danaher’s former water quality and product identification businesses) into an independent, publicly-traded company, further sharpening our strategic focus on life sciences and diagnostics. • We acquired Abcam plc, a leading global supplier of protein consumables, for a cash purchase price of approximately $5.6 billion. Abcam is now included in our Life Sciences segment. Even while meaningfully advancing
our strategic transformation, we: • Continued to invest aggressively in future growth, including investments of approximately $1.5 billion in research and development and $1.4 billion in capital expenditures. • Returned approximately $778 million to common shareholders through cash dividends (marking the 31st year in a row Danaher has paid a dividend on its common shares). • Generated $23.9 billion in sales, $5.2 billion in operating profit and $6.5 billion in operating cash flow. For a further discussion of Danaher’s business
performance in 2023 and over the long term, please see “Proxy Statement Summary – Business Highlights.” Executive Compensation Program Objectives With the goal of building long-term value
for our shareholders, we maintain an executive compensation program designed to: • attract and retain executives with the leadership skills, attributes and experience necessary to succeed
in an enterprise with Danaher’s size, diversity and global footprint; • motivate executives to demonstrate exceptional personal performance and perform consistently at or above
the levels that we expect, over the long-term and through a range of economic cycles; and • link compensation to the achievement of goals and objectives that we believe best correlate with the creation
of long-term shareholder value, including financial and strategic as well as sustainability-related objectives. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 44 Back to Contents To achieve these objectives our compensation program
combines annual and long-term components, cash and equity, and fixed and variable elements, with a bias toward long-term equity
awards tied closely to shareholder returns and subject to significant vesting and/or holding periods. Our executive compensation
program rewards our executive officers when they help increase long-term shareholder value, achieve annual business goals and build
long-term careers with Danaher. The science and technology markets in which we operate
are competitive, with demand sometimes exceeding the supply of talent, resulting in significant increases in compensation paid
by the companies with whom we compete for this talent. The same conditions exist in the market for executive-level talent that
can provide innovative leadership while managing at a global scale across multiple complex businesses. These trends require us
to regularly and proactively assess our executive compensation program to ensure it remains competitive in light of market conditions. Key Recent Changes to Executive Compensation Program Danaher’s Compensation Committee regularly reviews
our executive compensation program with a view toward continuous improvement and consideration of investor feedback. As a result
of these regular reviews, in recent years, the Committee has made several enhancements to the program to reinforce the already-strong
linkages (1) between pay and performance, (2) between the interests of our shareholders and the interests of our executive officers,
and (3) between the Company’s strategic plan and executive compensation program. These improvements have included: • the adoption of an incremental, additional compensation clawback policy to complement our already-rigorous clawback policy (as discussed in further detail below); • shortening of the vesting period for stock options granted to executive officers to four years, to most effectively balance retention considerations with the traditional, long-term focus of our program; • introduction of a core revenue growth performance metric in our executive short-term incentive compensation program; and • making our executive long-term incentive compensation program entirely performance-based. The Committee has enhanced our executive compensation
program over the last several years to reinforce our performance-oriented culture and expects to continue to improve the program
as appropriate, but also believes that consistent use of best-practice designs is important in effectively communicating
key messages to our executives. As a result, the Committee does not revise the program to align with emerging trends unless it
sees a clear business rationale for Danaher. 2023 Say-On-Pay Vote We provide our shareholders the opportunity to cast an annual
advisory vote with respect to our NEO compensation as disclosed in our annual proxy statement (the “say on pay proposal”). At our annual meeting of shareholders in May 2023, 95% of the votes cast on the say on pay proposal were voted in favor of the proposal. The Committee believes this result affirms shareholders’ support of the Company’s NEO compensation and did not make changes
to the Company’s executive compensation program as a result of such vote. 2023 Annual Executive Compensation The chart below summarizes key information with respect
to each pay element represented in Danaher’s 2023 annual executive compensation program: 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 45 Back to Contents Pay
    Element: Annual Long-Term Incentive Compensation (Equity) Pay
    Element: Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Primary Objectives: • Attract,
        retain and motivate skilled executives • Align
        the interests of management and shareholders by ensuring that realized compensation is: - in
        the case of stock options, commensurate with long-term changes in share price; and - in
        the case of PSUs, tied to (1) long-term changes in share price at all performance levels, and (2) relative TSR performance and
        attainment of average ROIC performance goals. Performance Requirement: • 4-year,
        time-based vesting schedule and a 10-year term • Options
        only have/increase in value if Danaher stock price increases • 3-year
        relative TSR (and average ROIC performance as a modifier) • 2-year
        holding period (incremental to 3-year performance period) Key Committee Considerations in Determining
2023 Compensation: • This
        pay element represented the most significant component of compensation for each NEO for 2023. • This
        pay element has the heaviest weighting of all our executive compensation program elements because it best supports our retention
        and motivation objectives and most directly aligns the interests of our executives with shareholders. • From
        time to time, we also grant time-vesting RSUs to executive officers, such as for retention purposes or in connection with new hires
        or promotions. Primary Objectives: • Motivate
        executives to achieve near-term operational and financial goals that support our long-term business objectives and strategic priorities • Attract,
        retain and motivate skilled executives • Allow
        for meaningful pay differentiation tied to annual performance of individuals and groups Form: Cash Performance Requirement: Key Committee Considerations in Determining
        2023 Compensation: • This
        pay element represented the second-most significant component of compensation for each NEO for 2023. Its focus on near-term performance
        and the cash nature of the award complements the longer-term, equity- based compensation elements of our program. Pay
    Element: Fixed Annual Compensation Pay
    Element: Other Compensation Primary Objectives • Provide
        sufficient fixed compensation to (1) mitigate incentive to pursue inappropriate risk-taking to maximize variable pay, and (2) allow
        a reasonable standard of living relative to peers Form: Cash Performance Requirement: N/A Key Committee Considerations in Determining
2023 Compensation: • Base
        salary should be sufficient to avoid competitive disadvantage while facilitating a sustainable fixed cost structure. • We
        also periodically use fixed cash bonuses for recruitment and retention purposes to attract and retain high-performing executives. Primary Objectives: • Make
        our total executive compensation plan competitive • Improve
        cost-effectiveness by delivering perceived value that exceeds our actual costs Form: Employee
        benefit plans; limited perquisites; severance benefits Performance Requirement: N/A Key Committee Considerations in Determining
2023 Compensation: • We
        believe these elements of compensation make our total executive compensation plan competitive and are generally commensurate with
        the benefits offered by our peers. • We
        believe the limited perquisites we offer are cost-effective in that the perceived value is higher than our actual cost, and they
        help to maximize the amount of time and focus that executives spend on Danaher business. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 46 Back to Contents (1) Adjusted EPS, Adjusted
    Free Cash Flow-to-Adjusted Net Income Ratio (which we also refer to as “Free Cash Flow Ratio”) and Core Revenue
    Growth are financial measures that do not comply with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Appendix
    A to this Proxy Statement quantifies and reconciles these measures to the comparable 2023 GAAP financial measures. “Adjusted Diluted
    Earnings Per Share” or “Adjusted EPS” means the Company’s “Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per
    Common Share” from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as reported on a Current Report
    on Form 8-K furnished by the Company on January 30, 2024 (“Form 8-K”), but excluding: (1) the impact of any change
    in accounting principles that occurred during the performance period and the cumulative effect thereof, to the extent such
    change was not considered in establishing target performance levels (the Committee may either apply the changed accounting
    principle to the performance period, or exclude the impact of the change in accounting principle from the period); and (2)(i)
    all transaction and financing costs directly related to the acquisition of any whole or partial interest in a business, (ii)
    all restructuring charges directly related to or arising from any business as to which the Company acquired a whole or partial
    interest and incurred within two years of the acquisition date, (iii) all charges and gains arising from the resolution of
    contingent liabilities identified as of the acquisition date and related to any business as to which the Company acquired
    a whole or partial interest, (iv) all other charges directly related to the acquisition of any whole or partial interest in
    a business and incurred within two years of the acquisition date, and (v) all gains or charges associated with the operation
    of any business as to which the Company acquired a whole or partial interest on or after January 1, 2023; provided, that with
    respect to the gains and charges referred to in sections (2)(iii) and (2)(iv) above, only gains or charges that individually
    or as part of a series of related items exceeded $10 million during the performance period are excluded. “Core Revenue
    Growth” is defined as sales from continuing operations calculated according to GAAP but excluding (1) sales from acquired
    businesses; and (2) the impact of currency translation. Sales attributable to acquired businesses refers to sales from acquired
    businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to divested product
    lines not considered discontinued operations. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as
    the difference between (i) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses); and (ii) the
    period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange
    rates to the prior year period. “Adjusted Free
    Cash Flow-to-Adjusted Net Income Ratio” or “Free Cash Flow Ratio” is defined as (A) the Company’s
    GAAP operating cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, less 2023 purchases of property,
    plant and equipment from continuing operations (net of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment); but excluding
    the cash flow impact of any discrete tax item in excess of $10 million or any other item that is excluded from Adjusted EPS,
    divided by (B) the Company’s Adjusted Net Income. “Adjusted Net Income” means the Company’s net income
    from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as determined pursuant to GAAP, but excluding the same adjustment
    items reflected in the calculation of Adjusted EPS. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 47 Back to Contents Compensation Governance The Committee recognizes that the success of our
executive compensation program over the long-term requires a robust framework of compensation governance. As a result, the Committee
regularly reviews external executive compensation practices and trends and incorporates best practices into our executive compensation
program. Below are highlights of our 2023 executive compensation program: What We Do What We Don’t Do Four-year
    vesting requirement for stock options; three-year performance period plus further two-year holding period for PSUs No
    tax gross-up provisions (except as applicable to management employees generally such as relocation policy) Incentive
    compensation programs feature multiple, different performance measures aligned with the Company’s strategic performance
    metrics No
    dividend/dividend equivalents paid on unvested equity awards Short-term
    and long-term performance metrics that balance our absolute performance and our relative performance versus peer companies No
    “single trigger” change of control benefits Rigorous,
    no-fault clawback policies that are triggered even in the absence of wrongdoing No
    defined benefit pension program for any NEO Minimum
    one-year vesting requirement for 95% of shares granted under the Company’s stock plan No
    hedging of Danaher securities permitted Stock
    ownership requirements for all executive officers No
    long-term incentive compensation is denominated or paid in cash (other than PSU dividend accruals) Limited
    perquisites and a cap on CEO/CFO personal aircraft usage No
    above-market returns on deferred compensation plans Independent
    compensation consultant that performs no other services for the Company No
    overlapping performance metrics between short-term and long-term incentive compensation programs 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 48 Back to Contents Risk Considerations Risk-taking is a necessary part of growing a business,
and prudent risk management is necessary to deliver long-term, sustainable shareholder value. The Committee believes that the Company’s
executive compensation program supports the objectives described above without encouraging inappropriate or excessive risk-taking.
In reaching this conclusion, the Committee considered in particular the following risk-mitigation attributes of our 2023 executive
compensation program. Attribute Key Risk Mitigating Effect • Emphasis on
        long-term, equity-based compensation • Four-year
        vesting requirement for stock options, and three-year performance period plus further two-year mandatory holding period
        for PSUs • Rigorous,
        no-fault clawback policies that are triggered even in the absence of wrongdoing and were expanded in 2023 • Discourages
        risk-taking that produces short-term results at the expense of building long-term shareholder value • Helps
        ensure executives realize their compensation over a time horizon consistent with achieving long-term shareholder value • Helps
        deter inappropriate actions and decisions that could harm Danaher and its key stakeholders • Incentive
                                         compensation programs feature multiple, complementary performance measures aligned

of compensation elements for each NEO for 2023, the Committee considered the factors referred to under “– Named Executive
Officer Compensation Framework” (without assigning any particular weight to any factor), exercised its judgment and adopted
the compensation elements described above under “Executive Summary –2023 Executive Compensation.” The graphics
below illustrate, for Mr. Blair and separately for the other NEOs in aggregate, the percentage of 2023 compensation that each element
of compensation accounted for (based on the amounts reported in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table): Amounts may not total 100% due to rounding. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 49 Back to Contents Long-Term Incentive Awards Target Award Values In February 2023, the Committee subjectively determined
the target dollar value of annual equity compensation to be delivered to each NEO in 2023, taking into account the following factors
(none of which was assigned a particular weight by the Committee): • the relative complexity and importance of the officer’s position; • the officer’s performance record and potential to contribute to future Company performance and assume additional leadership responsibility; • the risk/reward ratio of the award amount compared to the length of the related vesting and holding provisions, including the fact that the combined vesting and holding periods applicable to our executive awards are longer than typical for our peer group; • the amount of equity compensation necessary to provide sufficient retention value and long-term performance incentives in light of (1) compensation levels within the Company’s peer group, and (2) the officer’s historical compensation; • the competitive demand for our executives; and • the lack of a defined benefit pension plan for Danaher executives, and therefore the significance of long-term incentive awards as a capital accumulation opportunity. In determining Mr. Blair’s annual equity
compensation in February 2023, the Committee considered in particular Mr. Blair’s effective leadership of the Company as
the COVID-19 pandemic transitioned to endemic status; the Company’s strong financial and operational performance during his
tenure; and his progress in further refining and improving the Company’s strategy planning and development processes. Equity Award Mix Annual Equity Awards With respect to each of the NEO’s 2023 annual
equity awards, one-half of the target award value was delivered as stock options and one-half as PSUs. Please see “Grants
of Plan-Based Awards” table for the grant date fair value of the awards granted to each NEO. The Committee believes that the combination of
stock options and PSUs incentivizes and rewards shareholder value creation while supporting our talent retention objectives: • Stock options and PSUs inherently incentivize shareholder value creation since option holders realize no value unless our stock price rises after the option grant date and the value of PSUs is tied directly to the Company’s TSR performance relative to the S&P 500. • Our 2023 NEO stock options vest over four years and have a ten-year term and our 2023 NEO PSUs are subject to a three-year performance period and a further two-year holding period. In aggregate, these periods promote stability and encourage officers to take a long-term view of our performance. • The Committee believes our stock option award program in particular has contributed significantly to our strong performance record, which in turn has generally made our stock option awards valuable over the long-term and highly effective in recruiting, motivating and retaining highly skilled officers. Special Equity Awards In 2023, in addition to their annual equity awards,
each of Dr. Gutierrez-Ramos and Ms. Couchara received a special equity grant, with the target award value split evenly between
stock options and time-vesting RSUs. Please see the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards” table for the grant date fair value
of the special equity awards granted to each of these NEOs. Since Dr. Gutierrez-Ramos and Ms. Couchara are relatively new executive
officers, the Committee intended for these additional grants to enhance the amount and retention value of their Danaher equity
stakes. In addition to the benefits of stock options highlighted above, the Committee believes the use of RSUs on a selective basis
supports the Company’s executive officer retention objectives while also reinforcing long-term shareholder value creation.
While RSUs offer more modest upside potential than stock options or PSUs, during periods of stock market declines or modest growth
they are more likely to support our talent retention objectives. In addition, RSUs inherently incentivize shareholder value creation
since their value is tied directly to our stock price at all valuation levels, and the four-year vesting period promotes stability
and encourages officers to take a long-term view of our performance. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 50 Back to Contents PSU Performance Criteria The executive officer PSUs granted in 2023 are
subject to two performance criteria: Relative TSR The number of shares of Common Stock that vest
pursuant to the PSU award is based primarily on the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) ranking relative to the S&P
500 Index over an approximately three-year performance period. The Committee established threshold, target and maximum relative
TSR performance levels and developed a payout curve that requires above-median performance to earn the target opportunity and upper
quartile results to earn the maximum number of shares, as illustrated in the table below: Performance
    Level (Relative TSR Rank Within S&P 500 Index) Payout
    Percentage Below 35th percentile 0% 35th percentile 50% 55th percentile 100% 75th percentile or above 200% The payout percentages
for performance between the performance levels indicated above are determined by linear interpolation. The Committee selected the
S&P 500 Index as the relative TSR comparator group because the index consists of a broad and stable group of companies that
represents investors’ alternative capital investment opportunities, reinforcing
the linkage between our executive compensation program and the long-term interests of our shareholders. ROIC The Company’s three-year average ROIC performance
beginning with the year of grant, compared to the Company’s ROIC for the year immediately preceding the year of grant (the
“baseline year”), can increase or decrease the number of shares that would otherwise vest by 10% (but cannot cause
the payout percentage to exceed 200%), as illustrated in the table below: Three-Year
    Average ROIC Change (2) (Compared to Baseline Year ROIC) ROIC
    Modifier Factor At or above + 200 basis points 110% Below + 200 basis points and above zero basis points 100% At or below zero basis points 90% (2) “Three-Year Average ROIC Change” means (1) the quotient of (a) the Company’s Adjusted Net Income for the three-year ROIC performance period divided by three, divided by (b) the Company’s Adjusted Invested Capital for the ROIC performance period, less (2) the quotient of (x) the Company’s Adjusted Net Income for the year immediately preceding the date of grant (the “baseline year”), divided by (y) the Company’s Adjusted Invested Capital for the baseline year. “Adjusted Invested Capital” means the average of the quarter-end balances for each fiscal quarter of the ROIC performance period of (a) the sum of (i) the Company’s GAAP total stockholders’ equity and (ii) the Company’s GAAP total short-term and long-term debt; less (b) the Company’s GAAP cash and cash equivalents; but excluding in all cases the impact of (1) any business acquisition by the Company for a purchase price equal to or greater than $250 million and consummated during the ROIC performance period, (2) any business sale, divestiture or disposition by the Company during the ROIC performance period, and (3) all Company investments in marketable or non-marketable securities that are consummated during the ROIC performance period. “Adjusted Net Income” is calculated in a manner similar to the definition set forth in the preceding footnote, except that (i) only transaction costs and operating gains/charges associated with acquisitions consummated during the ROIC performance period with a purchase price equal to or greater than $250 million are excluded, (ii) gains/charges associated with discontinued operations are not excluded, and (iii) gains/charges related to Company strategic investments as well as all after-tax interest expense are excluded. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company’s
absolute TSR performance for the period is negative no more than 100% of the target PSUs will vest (regardless of how strong the
Company’s performance is on a relative basis), and if the Company’s absolute TSR performance for the period is positive,
a minimum of 25% of the target PSUs will vest. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 51 Back to Contents Vesting and Holding Period With respect to the PSUs granted in 2023, any
PSUs that vest following the three-year performance period are subject to an additional two-year holding period and are paid out
in shares of Company Common Stock following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the performance period. Any dividends
paid on the Company’s Common Stock during the performance and holding periods are credited to PSU accounts, but are only
paid out (in cash) to the extent the underlying PSUs vest based on performance and are not paid until the shares underlying the
vested PSUs are issued. PSUs Earned for 2021 – 2023 Performance Period PSUs for the 2021 – 2023 performance period,
which ended December 31, 2023, were earned and certified in February 2024 based on an earned payout percentage of 66%, resulting
from (1) the Company’s three-year absolute TSR of 9.59% ranking at the 39th percentile relative to the TSRs of the companies
in the S&P 500 index as of the beginning of the performance period (February 24, 2021), and (2) a Three-Year Average ROIC Change
of 519 basis points. These PSUs remain subject to a further mandatory holding period that runs through 2025. Annual Incentive Awards Overview The diagram below illustrates the 2023 annual
incentive award opportunities the Committee determined for the Company’s NEOs in May 2023 under the Omnibus Plan, each element
of which is further described below. Target Bonus Percentage and Personal Payout Percentage In May 2023, the Committee established NEO target
bonus percentages (as a multiple of base salary) and the personal performance objectives described below, including quantitative
and qualitative objectives as well as objectives based on financial and non-financial measures. The Committee did not assign a
particular weighting to any of the objectives. The Committee set the quantitative objectives at levels that, while achievable,
would in its opinion require personal performance appreciably above the executive’s prior year performance level. 2024

    goals relating to capital allocation. Determining Target Bonus Percentage In determining the target bonus percentage for
each NEO, the Committee considered the relative complexity and importance of the executive’s position and the amount of annual
cash incentive compensation that peer companies typically pay to executives serving in comparable roles. With respect to Mr. Blair
in particular, although the Committee did not target the performance-based portion of the CEO’s annual cash compensation
at any particular percentage of total annual cash compensation, the Committee strategically set the base salary at a level lower,
and target annual bonus opportunity at a level higher, than typical among the Company’s peer companies to help ensure that
the CEO’s annual cash compensation is meaningfully performance-based. Determining Personal Payout Percentage Following the end of 2023, the Committee used
its judgment and determined for each NEO a Personal Payout Percentage between 0% and 200%. The Committee believes that its ability
to exercise discretion in connection with the annual executive cash incentive compensation awards is an important element in reaching
balanced compensation decisions that are consistent with our strategy, reward both current year performance and sustained long-term
value creation, and reward achievements that advance our sustainability strategy. The Committee’s ability to exercise discretion: • helps mitigate the risks associated with a rigid and strictly formulaic compensation program, which could unintentionally create incentives for our executives to focus only on certain performance metrics or encourage imprudent risk taking; • gives the Committee flexibility to address changes in economic conditions and our operating environment that occur during the performance period; and 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 53 Back to Contents • allows the Committee to adjust compensation based on factors that would not be appropriately reflected by a strictly formulaic approach focused solely on Company performance, such as advancing sustainability-related goals, championing Danaher’s culture and values and recognition of individual performance levels. Without assigning any particular weight to any
individual factor, the Committee took into account the executive’s execution against their personal performance objectives
for the year, the executive’s performance with respect to each of the Company’s four “Core Behaviors” (which
are a set of standards and behaviors that Danaher associates are expected to aspire to and are assessed against), the executive’s
overall performance for the year, the size of the Company Payout Percentage for the year, and the amount of annual cash incentive
compensation that peer companies typically pay to executives serving in comparable roles. Without limiting the foregoing, with
respect to the executive officer team’s 2023 performance as a whole the Committee considered in particular the Company’s
2023 financial performance relative to the challenging macro-economic environment impacting most of the Company’s businesses;
portfolio optimization achievements, including successful completion of the Veralto Spin-Off and Abcam acquisition; and the Company’s
proactiveness during the year in identifying and executing upon opportunities to invest in the Company’s future financial,
strategic and competitive positioning. The average Personal Payout Percentage of the NEOs (other than Mr. Blair) was 156%. The Company awarded
Mr. Blair a Personal Payout Percentage of 165% for 2023, based primarily on the Company’s financial and operational performance
relative to the challenging macro-economic environment impacting most of the Company’s businesses; portfolio optimization
achievements, including successful completion of the Veralto Spin-Off and Abcam acquisition; progress in further enhancing the
Company’s innovation and strategy development processes, strategic direction and science and technology organization and
capabilities; and leadership recruitment and development and
progress against the Company’s DE+I objectives. Company Payout Percentage The Company Payout Percentage is formulaic, based
on the Company’s 2023 performance against the Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow Ratio and Core Revenue Growth metrics described
above and below and in Appendix A (the “Metrics”). The Committee weights Adjusted EPS most heavily in the formula because
it believes Adjusted EPS correlates strongly with shareholder returns, particularly since Adjusted EPS is calculated in a manner
that focuses on gains and charges the Committee believes are most directly related to Company operating performance during the
period. The Committee also uses the Free Cash Flow Ratio to help validate the quality of the Company’s earnings, and Core
Revenue Growth to incentivize an appropriate balance between profitability and growth. For each of the Metrics, the Committee established
threshold, target and maximum levels of Company performance, as well as a payout percentage curve that related each level of performance
to a payout expressed as a percentage of target bonus. The payout percentage was 0% for below-threshold performance, 50% for threshold
performance, 100% for target performance and 200% for performance that equaled or exceeded the maximum. The payout percentages
for performance between threshold and target, or between target and maximum, respectively, were determined by linear interpolation. In determining the
target performance level and payout percentage curve for the Metrics, the Committee considered historical performance data for
the Company and its peer group, analyst estimates for the Company’s peer group, the Company’s annual budget and macroeconomic/end-market
trends. The Committee set the 2023 threshold, target and maximum performance values for the Metrics lower than for 2022 primarily
because the elevated levels of COVID-19 related customer
and end-user demand in 2022 were not expected to (and did not) repeat in 2023, as the pandemic’s evolution to endemic status
diminished demand and as many customers re-purposed pandemic-period inventory. However, the Compensation Committee believes the
performance values it established for 2023 appropriately reflected the applicable economic and operating environment and incentivized
attractive, relative performance. Specifically, for each Metric, the Committee set the performance target at a level it believed
would represent attractive financial performance within our industry and would require a high (but achievable) level of Company
performance, while requiring what it believed would be outstanding performance to achieve the maximum payout level. In addition,
when the Committee established the 2023 award opportunity, it also provided that upon the consummation of the Veralto Spin-Off in
2023, the threshold, target and maximum levels would be adjusted as applicable to exclude the Veralto business, and the Company’s
2023 performance would be evaluated excluding any contributions from Veralto. The performance values set forth below reflect such
adjustment. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 54 Back to Contents Following the end of 2023, the Company Payout
Percentage was calculated as follows: 2023
    Performance/Payout Matrix Metric Threshold Performance Level Target Performance Level Maximum Performance Level Payout
    % (Before Weighting) Metric Weighting Weighted Payout % Adjusted EPS 97.8% 59% Free Cash Flow Ratio 107.0% 21% Core Revenue Growth 66.7% 13% Company Payout
    Percentage: 93% (as rounded) Composite Payout Percentage The Company Payout Percentage and Personal Payout
Percentage were calculated for each NEO, weighted accordingly and added to yield the officer’s Composite Payout Percentage.
The Composite Payout Percentage was multiplied by the NEO’s target bonus amount to yield the executive’s award amount
for the year. The 2023 annual cash incentive compensation awards for each of the NEOs are set forth in the Summary Compensation
Table. Base Salaries The Committee typically reviews base salaries
for executive officers in February of each year and in connection with promotions and new hires. In February 2023, the Committee
subjectively determined 2023 base salaries for the NEOs. In each case the Committee used the officer’s prior base salary
as the initial basis of consideration and then considered the individual factors described under “– Named Executive
Officer Compensation Framework,” focusing on the relative complexity and importance of the executive’s role within
Danaher, the market value of the executive’s role and the executive’s performance in the prior year (without giving
specific weight to any particular factor). Given that base salary is one of the elements in the formula for determining annual
cash incentive compensation, the Committee also considered how changes in base salary would impact annual cash incentive compensation. Other Compensation Severance Benefits We have entered into Proprietary Interest Agreements
with each of our NEOs that include post-employment restrictive covenant obligations. Danaher’s Senior Leader Severance Pay
Plan, which each of the NEOs participates in, provides for severance payments under certain circumstances. Mr. Blair’s Proprietary
Interest Agreement entitles him to certain additional cash payments if the Company terminates his employment without cause. We
believe the post-employment restrictive covenant obligations included in these agreements are critical in protecting our proprietary
assets, and that the severance payments payable upon a termination without cause are generally commensurate with the severance
rights our peers offer executives in comparable roles. There is no change-in-control provision in the Senior Leader Severance Pay
Plan or in any NEO employment agreement. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 55 Back to Contents EDIP, ECP and DCP As discussed in more detail under “Summary
of Employment Agreements and Plans – Supplemental Retirement Program,” each NEO (1) participates in either the Amended
and Restated Executive Deferred Incentive Program (“EDIP”), or the ECP, and (2) is eligible to participate in the voluntary
Deferred Compensation Plan (“DCP”): • The EDIP and ECP are each non-qualified, unfunded excess contribution programs available to selected members of our management. We use these programs to tax-effectively contribute amounts to executives’ and other participants’ retirement accounts and provide an opportunity to realize tax-deferred, market-based notional investment growth on these contributions. • The DCP allows each participant to voluntarily defer, on a pre-tax basis, up to 85% of their salary and/or up to 85% of their non-equity annual incentive compensation with respect to a given plan year. The DCP gives our executives and other participants an opportunity to defer taxes on cash compensation and realize tax-deferred, market-based notional investment growth on their deferrals. Other Benefits and Perquisites All of our executives are eligible to participate
in our U.S. employee benefit plans, including our group medical, dental, vision, disability, accidental death and dismemberment,
life insurance, flexible spending and 401(k) plans. These plans are generally available to all U.S. salaried employees and do not
discriminate in favor of executive officers. In addition, the Committee makes certain perquisites available to the NEOs that we
believe help maximize the amount of time and focus that executives spend on Danaher business; please see the footnotes to the Summary
Compensation Table for additional details. The Committee has also adopted a policy prohibiting any tax reimbursement or gross-up
provisions in our executive compensation program (except under a policy applicable to management employees generally such as a
relocation policy). Peer Group Compensation Analysis The Committee does not target a specific competitive
position versus the market or peer companies in determining the compensation of our executives because in light of the Company’s
diverse mix of businesses, strict targeting of a specified compensation posture would not appropriately reflect the unique nature
of our business portfolio or the degree of difficulty in leading the Company and key businesses and functions. However, the Committee
believes it is important to clearly understand the relevant market for executive talent to inform its decision-making and ensure
that our executive compensation program supports our recruitment and retention needs and is fair and efficient. As a result, the
Committee has worked with FW Cook to develop a peer group for purposes of assessing competitive compensation practices, and periodically
reviews compensation data for the peer group derived from publicly filed proxy statements. The Committee periodically reviews the
companies included in the peer group to ensure that the peer group remains appropriate. Executive Compensation Peer Group Prior to November
2023 Prior to November 2023, the Company’s peer
group (for purposes of all 2023 executive compensation decisions) consisted of the companies set forth below: 3M Company Boston Scientific Corporation IQVIA Holdings Inc. Abbott Laboratories Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Johnson & Johnson AbbVie Inc. Ecolab Inc. Medtronic Inc. Amgen Inc. Eli Lilly and Company Stryker Corporation Baxter International, Inc. Honeywell International Inc. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Becton Dickinson & Co. The Committee selected companies for inclusion
in this peer group based on (1) the extent to which they compete with us in one or more lines of business, for executive talent
and for investors, and (2) comparability of revenues, market capitalization, net income, total assets and number of employees. 2024

    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 57 Back to Contents Named Executive Officer Compensation Framework Danaher’s compensation program is grounded on the
principle that each executive must consistently demonstrate exceptional personal performance in order to remain a Danaher executive. Within
the framework of this principle and the other objectives discussed above, the Committee exercises its judgment in making executive compensation
decisions. The factors that generally shape particular executive compensation decisions (none of which are assigned any particular weight
by the Committee) are the following: • The relative complexity and importance of the executive’s position
    within Danaher. To ensure that the most senior executives are held most accountable
    for long-term operating results and changes in shareholder value, the Committee believes that both the amount and “at-risk”
    nature of compensation should increase with the relative complexity and significance of an executive’s position. • The executive’s record of performance, long-term leadership potential and tenure. • Danaher’s performance. Our
    cash incentive compensation varies annually to reflect near-term changes in operating and financial results. Our long-term compensation
    is closely aligned with long-term shareholder value creation, both by tying the ultimate value of the awards to long-term shareholder
    returns and because of the length of time executives are required to hold the awards before realizing their value. • Our assessment of pay levels and practices in the competitive marketplace. The
    Committee considers market practice in determining pay levels and compensation design to ensure that our costs are sustainable relative
    to peers and compensation is appropriately positioned to attract and retain talented executives. As noted above, the market for executive-level
    talent is highly competitive. We also have a history of successfully applying the Danaher Business System, or DBS, to deliver strong
    operating performance and create shareholder value, and we devote significant resources to training our executives in DBS. As a result
    of these factors, we believe that our executives are particularly valued by other companies, which creates a high degree of retention
    risk. The philosophy and goals of our compensation program
have remained consistent over time, although the Committee considers the factors above within the context of the then-prevailing economic
environment and may adjust the terms and/or amounts of compensation accordingly so that they continue to support our objectives. For a description of the role of the Company’s
executives and the Committee’s independent compensation consultant in the executive compensation process, please see “Corporate
Governance – Board of Directors and Committees of the Board –Compensation Committee.” Other Compensation Policies and Information Long-Term Incentive Compensation Grant Practices Equity awards are granted under Danaher’s Omnibus
Plan, which is described in “Summary of Employment Agreements and Plans – 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan.” Executive
equity awards are typically granted as of one of the Company’s four, standardized grant dates during the year, and may also be granted
at the time of an executive hire or promotion or upon identification of a specific retention concern. The grant date is either the date
of grant approval or a specified date subsequent to the approval date. The timing of equity awards has not been coordinated with the release
of material non-public information. The Committee’s general practice is to approve annual equity awards to executive officers at
the Committee’s regularly scheduled meeting in February, when the Committee reviews the performance of the executive officers and
typically determines most or all of the other components of executive compensation. The target dollar award value attributable to PSUs and
RSUs, respectively, has been translated into a target number of PSUs or a number of RSUs, as applicable, based on fair market value. The
target dollar award value attributable to stock options has been translated into a number of stock options based on the actual Black Scholes
value used in the Company’s financial statements with respect to the particular grant. The exercise price for stock option awards
granted under the Omnibus Plan equals the closing price of Danaher’s Common Stock on the date of grant (or on the immediately preceding
trading day if the date of grant is not a trading day). 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 58 Back to Contents Stock Ownership-Related Policies Stock Ownership Requirements To further align management and shareholder interests
and discourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking, our stock ownership policy requires each executive officer to obtain a substantial
equity stake in Danaher within five years of their appointment to an executive position, as follows: Title Stock
    Ownership Multiple Chief Executive Officer 6 times base salary Executive Vice President 3 times base salary Senior Vice President 2 times base salary What Counts as Ownership: What Does Not Count as Ownership: • Shares in which the executive or their spouse or child has a direct or indirect interest • Unexercised stock options • Notional shares of Danaher stock in the EDIP, ECP or DCP • Unvested PSUs • Shares held in a 401(k) plan • Unvested RSUs • Vested PSUs Once an executive officer has acquired a number of Company
shares that satisfies the applicable ownership multiple, such number of shares then becomes the officer’s minimum ownership requirement
(even if the officer’s salary increases or the fair market value of such shares subsequently changes) until the officer is promoted
to a higher level. Each NEO employed by Danaher as of December 31, 2023, was in compliance with the stock ownership requirements as of
such date. Pledging Policy Danaher’s Board has adopted a policy that prohibits
any director or executive officer from pledging as security under any obligation any shares of Danaher Common Stock that the director
or officer directly or indirectly owns and controls (other than shares pledged as of the date the policy was adopted), and provides that
pledged shares of Danaher Common Stock do not count toward Danaher’s stock ownership requirements. No NEO has pledged any shares
of Danaher Common Stock. Hedging Policy Under our insider trading policy, Danaher directors and
employees (including executive officers) are prohibited from engaging in short sales of Danaher Common Stock, transactions in any derivative
of a Danaher security (including, but not limited to, buying or selling puts, calls or other options (except for instruments granted under
a Danaher equity compensation plan)) or any other forms of hedging transactions with respect to Danaher securities. Clawback Policies To further discourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking,
the Committee has adopted rigorous, “no-fault” clawback policies that comply with the clawback policy requirements of the
New York Stock Exchange. Danaher’s clawback policies provide for recovery of incentive-based compensation erroneously received by
current or former executive officers during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which the company is required
to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. “Incentive-based compensation”
is defined as any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of any financial reporting
measure, and “financial reporting measure” is defined to include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, stock price and
total shareholder return. The policies provide for limited exceptions to the Company’s obligation to enforce the NYSE-required
terms due to impracticability of recovery. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 59 Back to Contents The Company’s clawback policies extend beyond the
terms required by the NYSE listing standards. These extended terms apply to a broader group of senior management than just executive officers
and provide that in the event of a material accounting restatement (not required pursuant to a change in accounting rules) the Company
may recover from a covered person: • the portion of annual incentive compensation awarded during specified periods
    that would not have been awarded had the affected financial statements been correctly stated; and • all annual incentive compensation awarded to, gains from stock option exercises by and other stock
    compensation-related benefits received by the covered person during specified periods if such person’s fraud or intentional
    misconduct alone or with others caused such restatement. In addition, the stock plans in which Danaher’s
executive officers participate contain provisions for recovering awards upon certain circumstances. Under the terms of the Company’s
Omnibus Plan, if an employee is terminated for gross misconduct, the administrator may terminate up to all of the participant’s
unexercised or unvested equity awards. In addition, under the terms of each of the EDIP and the ECP, if the administrator determines that
the circumstances of a participant’s termination constitute gross misconduct, the administrator may determine that the participant’s
vesting percentage is as low as zero with respect to all balances that were contributed by Danaher. Regulatory Considerations Section 162(m) generally disallows a tax deduction to
public corporations for compensation in excess of $1 million paid for any fiscal year to certain executive officers. We review the tax
impact of our executive compensation on the Company as well as on the executive officers. In addition, we review the impact of our compensation
programs against other considerations, such as accounting impact, shareholder alignment, market competitiveness, effectiveness and perceived
value to employees. Because many different factors influence a well-rounded, comprehensive and effective executive compensation program,
some of the compensation we provide to our executive officers is not deductible under Section 162(m). Treatment of Equity-Based Compensation Upon Veralto
Spin-Off In connection with the Veralto Spin-Off and pursuant
to the anti-dilution provisions of the Omnibus Plan and deferred compensation plans, as applicable, the Company made certain adjustments
to the share reserves and limits set forth thereunder, as well as the exercise price and the number of shares underlying the stock-based
compensation awards held by our directors, executive officers and other employees, with the intention of preserving the intrinsic value
of the awards prior to the Veralto Spin-Off. All disclosures in this Proxy Statement reflect such adjustments. The stock-based compensation
awards continue to vest over their original vesting period. Stock-based compensation awards that were held by employees who transferred
to Veralto in connection with the Veralto Spin-Off were canceled and replaced by awards issued by Veralto. Compensation Committee Report This report is not deemed to be “soliciting

granted in the form of performance stock units (PSUs), except that a portion of Dr. Gutierrez-Ramos’ 2023 and 2022 stock awards
and a portion of Ms. Couchara’s 2023 stock award were granted in the form of RSUs. With respect to RSUs, the grant date fair value
under FASB ASC Topic 718 was calculated based on the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the RSU, times the closing price of the
Common Stock on the date of grant (but discounted to account for the fact that RSUs do not accrue dividend rights prior to vesting and
distribution). With respect to PSUs, the grant date fair value under FASB ASC Topic 718 has been calculated based on the probable outcome
of the applicable performance conditions and a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model modified to reflect an illiquidity discount (as
a result of the mandatory two-year post-vesting holding period), using the following significant assumptions (since the performance criteria
applicable to the performance stock units are considered a “market condition,” footnote disclosure of the award’s potential
maximum value is not required): Monte

    in the table above, the footnotes below describe the vesting terms applicable to the entire award of which such options, PSUs or
    RSUs are a part. (2) Market value is calculated based on (a) the closing price of Danaher’s Common Stock on
    December 31, 2023 as reported on the NYSE ($231.34 per share) times the number of shares, plus (b) in the case of PSUs, the amount
    of cash dividend equivalent rights attached to the respective PSUs and accrued as of December 31, 2023. (3) The option award was granted subject to time-based vesting conditions such that one-half of the
    award became or becomes exercisable on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date. (4) The option award was granted subject to time-based vesting conditions such that one-half of the
    award became or becomes exercisable on each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. (5) The number of shares of Common Stock that vest pursuant to the PSU award is based on the Company’s
    total shareholder return (TSR) ranking relative to the S&P 500 Index over an approximately three-year performance period. Payout
    at 100% of the target level requires that the Company achieve above-median performance and rank at the 55th percentile of the S&P
    500 Index, while the PSUs pay out at 200% for performance that equals or exceeds the 75th percentile, 50% for performance at the
    35th percentile and zero percent for performance below the 35th percentile. The payout percentages for performance between the performance
    levels are determined by linear interpolation. The Company’s three-year average ROIC beginning with the year of grant, compared to the
    Company’s ROIC for the immediately preceding year (the “baseline year”), can increase or decrease the number of
    shares that would otherwise vest by 10% (but cannot cause the payout percentage to exceed 200%). Notwithstanding the above, if the
    Company’s absolute TSR performance for the period is negative a maximum of 100% of the target PSUs will vest (regardless of
    how strong the Company’s performance is on a relative basis), and if the Company’s absolute TSR performance for the period
    is positive a minimum of 25% of the target PSUs will vest. Any PSUs that vest following the three-year performance period are subject
    to an additional two-year holding period and are paid out in shares of Company Common Stock following the fifth anniversary of the
    commencement of the performance period. For purposes of this table, the number of PSU shares and payout value reported in the table
    reflect target-level performance for PSUs granted in 2022 and 2023; the 2021 PSUs are addressed separately in Footnote 6 below. (6) The number of shares and market value reported in the table reflect actual performance, since
    the three-year performance period for these PSU awards has concluded. These PSU awards were subject to the performance criteria set
    forth in Footnote 5, vested when the Company’s Compensation Committee certified the level of performance achieved, and remain
    subject to a holding period that concludes on the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the applicable performance period. 2024

    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 68 Back to Contents Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-of-Control
as of 2023 Fiscal Year-End The following table describes the payments and
benefits that each named executive officer would be entitled to receive upon termination of employment or in connection with a
change-of-control of Danaher. The amounts set forth below assume that the triggering event occurred on December 31, 2023. Where
benefits are based on the market value of Danaher’s Common Stock, we have used the closing price of Danaher’s Common
Stock as reported on the NYSE on December 31, 2023 ($231.34 per share). In addition to the amounts set forth below, upon any termination
of employment each officer would also be entitled to: • receive all payments generally provided to salaried employees on a non-discriminatory basis upon termination, such as accrued salary, life insurance proceeds (for any termination caused by death), unused vacation and 401(k) Plan distributions; • potentially receive an annual cash incentive compensation award pursuant to the Omnibus Plan, since under the terms of the award a participant who remains employed through the end of the annual performance period is eligible for an award under the plan; • receive accrued, vested balances under the EDIP, ECP and DCP, if applicable (provided that under the EDIP and the ECP, if the administrator determines that the circumstances of a participant’s termination constitute gross misconduct, the administrator may determine that the participant’s vesting percentage is as low as zero with respect to all balances that were contributed by Danaher); and • exercise vested stock options (provided that under the terms of the Omnibus Plan, if an employee is terminated for gross misconduct, the administrator may terminate up to all of the participant’s unexercised or unvested equity awards). The terms of the EDIP, ECP, DCP and Omnibus Plan
are described under “Summary of Employment Agreements and Plans.” Termination/Change-of-Control

For a description of these provisions under the Omnibus Plan, please see “Summary of Employment Agreements and Plans.” (3) If Mr. Blair had retired as of December 31, 2023, he would have qualified for “early retirement” treatment under the terms of the Omnibus Plan, which provides for, among other terms, continued vesting of certain of the participant’s stock options, RSUs and PSUs (based on the actual performance level achieved) following early retirement. For a description of these provisions under the Omnibus Plan, please see “Summary of Employment Agreements and Plans.” (4) Please see “Summary of Employment Agreements and Plans” for a description of the respective benefits and cash payments each officer would be entitled to if Danaher terminates the officer’s employment without cause, as well as a description of the post-employment restrictive covenant obligations of each officer. The amounts set forth in the table assume that the officer would have executed Danaher’s standard release in connection with any termination without cause. (5) Under the terms of the EDIP and ECP,

    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 73 Back to Contents Pay Versus Performance The disclosure in this section shall not be
deemed to be incorporated by reference into any prior or subsequent filing by Danaher under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange
Act of 1934, except to the extent Danaher specifically incorporates it by reference therein. Provided below is the Company’s “pay
versus performance” disclosure as required pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act.
As required by Item 402(v), we have included: • A list of the most important measures that our Compensation Committee used in 2023 to link a measure of pay calculated in accordance with Item 402(v) (referred to as “compensation actually paid”, or “CAP”) to Company performance; • A table that compares the total compensation of our named executive officers’ (also known as NEOs) as presented in the Summary Compensation Table (“SCT”) to CAP and that compares CAP to specified performance measures; and • Graphs that describe: • the relationships between CAP and our cumulative total shareholder return (“TSR”), GAAP Net Income, and our Company selected measure, non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations (“Adjusted EPS”); and • the relationship between our TSR and the TSR of the S&P 500 Health Care Index (“Peer Group TSR”). Salary, Bonus, Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation,
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings and All Other Compensation are each calculated in the same manner for purposes of both
CAP and SCT. There are two primary differences between the calculation of CAP and SCT total compensation: SCT Total CAP Pension Year over year change in the actuarial present value of pension benefits Current year service cost and any prior year service cost (if a plan amendment occurred during the year) Stock and Option Awards Grant date fair value of stock and option awards granted during the year Year over year change in the fair value of stock and option awards
    that are unvested as of the end of the year, or vested or were forfeited during the year (1) (1) Includes any dividends paid on equity awards in the fiscal year prior to the vesting date that are not otherwise reflected in the fair value of such award. This disclosure has been prepared in accordance
with Item 402(v) and does not necessarily reflect value actually realized by the executives or how our Committee evaluates compensation
decisions in light of Company or individual performance. In particular, our Committee has not used CAP as a basis for making executive
compensation decisions, nor does it use GAAP Net Income or Peer Group TSR for purposes of determining executive incentive compensation.
Please refer to our Compensation Discussion and Analysis on pages 44 to 60 for a discussion of our executive compensation program
objectives and the ways in which we align executive compensation with performance. Our Most Important Metrics Used for
Linking Pay and Performance. As required by Item 402(v), below are the most important
metrics our Committee used to link executive pay to performance for 2023. Our stock price performance, as reflected by our absolute TSR,
directly impacts the value of the equity compensation awards we grant to executive officers. Each of the other metrics below are used
for purposes of determining payouts under either our executive annual cash incentive compensation program or our executive PSU program. • Absolute TSR • Relative TSR compared to S&P 500 TSR • Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) • Adjusted Free Cash Flow to Adjusted Net Income Ratio (non-GAAP) • Core Revenue Growth (non-GAAP) 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 74 Back to Contents Adjusted EPS is the most heavily weighted metric
used to determine Company performance under our executive annual cash incentive compensation program. The Committee weights Adjusted
EPS most heavily in the Company performance formula because it believes Adjusted EPS correlates strongly with shareholder returns,
particularly since Adjusted EPS is calculated in a manner that focuses on gains and charges the Committee believes are most directly
related to Company operating performance during the period. Accordingly, Adjusted EPS is the Company-selected measure included
in the table and graphs that follow. Pay Versus Performance Table. In accordance with Item 402(v), we provide below the tabular disclosure for the Company’s

Paid Pay Ratio Disclosure Provided below is information about the relationship
of the annual total compensation of Rainer M. Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and the annual total compensation
of the median of our employees other than Mr. Blair. We identified the median employee as of October
31, 2023 based on (1) annual base salary (for all Company salaried employees, other than Mr. Blair) and hourly rate multiplied
by scheduled annual work hours (for all Company hourly employees), and (2) the target annual cash incentive compensation for each
employee entitled thereto (other than Mr. Blair). The calculation included all employees whether employed full time, part time
or on a seasonal basis. The pay ratio set forth below is a reasonable
estimate calculated in a manner consistent with applicable SEC rules. In light of the numerous different methodologies, assumptions,
adjustments and estimates that companies may apply as permitted under the SEC rules, this information should not be used as a basis
for comparison between different companies. For 2023, our last completed fiscal year: • the annual total compensation of Mr. Blair, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table presented elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, was $20,903,282; • the annual total compensation of the median of all Danaher employees (other than Mr. Blair) was $65,010; and • the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Blair to the annual total compensation of the median of all other Company employees was 322 to 1. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 79 Back to Contents Summary of Employment Agreements and Plans Following is a description of (1) named executive
officer employment-related agreements, and (2) the cash incentive compensation, equity compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation
and severance pay plans in which Danaher’s named executive officers participate. Each of these plans allows the plan administrator
to exercise certain discretion in the administration of the plan, and as a result the plan administrator may administer the plan
in a different manner from period to period, or in a different manner with respect to different plan participants, in each case
to the extent permitted under the applicable plan. Employment Agreements Named Executive Officer Proprietary Interest
Agreements In connection with Mr. Blair’s promotion
to the role of President and CEO in 2020, Danaher and Mr. Blair entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement Regarding Competition
and Protection of Proprietary Interests (the “Blair Agreement”). Under the Blair Agreement, during and for two years
after Mr. Blair’s employment with us, subject to certain customary exceptions, he is prohibited from disclosing or improperly
using any of our confidential information; making any disparaging comments about us; competing with us; selling to or soliciting
purchases from our customers and prospective customers with respect to products and services about which he has particular knowledge;
or hiring or soliciting any of our current or recent employees, and during and for one year after his employment with us he is
prohibited from working for any Danaher customers or vendors in any role in which he would use or disclose or threaten to use or
disclose any of our confidential information. In addition, with limited exceptions all intellectual property that Mr. Blair develops
in connection with his employment with us belongs to us. The Blair Agreement further provides that if we terminate Mr. Blair’s
employment without “cause” or if he terminates his employment for “good reason” (each as defined in the
Blair Agreement), he will be entitled to (1) a cash amount equal to twelve months of base salary at the rate in effect on the date
of termination (the “Termination Date,” and the year in which the Termination Date occurs is referred to as the “Termination
Year”), (2) the annual cash incentive compensation award for service in the calendar year prior to the Termination Year,
if it has not been paid prior to the Termination Date (the “Accrued Obligation”), (3) a cash amount equal to his target
annual cash incentive compensation award for the Termination Year, and (4) a cash amount equal to the product of (x) his target
annual cash incentive compensation award for the Termination Year, times (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days from the beginning of the Termination Year through the Termination Date, and the denominator of which is 365; provided
in each case he signs and does not revoke a release of all claims. Any cash severance payments paid under any other Danaher plan
or agreement will diminish the severance payments under the Blair Agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis (except for the Accrued
Obligation). We have also entered into an agreement with each
of the other NEOs under which each such officer is subject to certain covenants designed to protect Danaher’s proprietary
interests (each, a “Proprietary Interest Agreement”). Except for differences in the duration of certain restrictive
covenants, the terms of such agreements are substantially the same. During and for specified periods after the officer’s
employment with us, subject to certain customary exceptions, the officer is prohibited from disclosing or improperly using any
of our confidential information; making any disparaging comments about us; competing with us; selling to or soliciting purchases
from our customers and prospective customers with respect to products and services about which the officer has particular knowledge;
or hiring or soliciting any of our current or recent employees. Each officer also agrees that with limited exceptions all intellectual
property that the officer develops in connection with the officer’s employment with us belongs to us. Certain of the agreements
also restrict interfering with our vendor relationships, and certain of the agreements prohibit the officer for a specified period
of time from working for any Danaher customers or vendors in any role in which the officer would use or disclose or threaten to
use or disclose any of our confidential information. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 80 Back to Contents Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification
and Insurance Danaher’s Certificate of Incorporation requires
it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action
or proceeding by reason of their service as a director or officer of Danaher, or by reason of serving at Danaher’s request
as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to certain exceptions. Danaher’s Bylaws provide for similar indemnification
rights. In addition, each of Danaher Corporation’s directors and executive officers has executed an indemnification agreement
with Danaher that provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses
in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. Danaher also has in effect directors and officers liability
insurance covering all of Danaher’s directors and officers. 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
of Danaher (the “Administrator”) administers the Omnibus Plan. The following awards may be granted under the Omnibus
Plan: stock options, SARs, restricted stock, RSUs and other stock-based awards (including PSUs), as such terms are defined in the
Omnibus Plan, as well as cash-based awards (collectively, all such awards are referred to as “awards”). Award Limits 135,443,592 shares of Common Stock have been authorized
for issuance under the Omnibus Plan (the “Maximum Share Limit”). Under the terms of the plan, (1) each share of Common
Stock subject to a full value award and granted before February 28, 2017 counts against the Maximum Share Limit as one share
of Common Stock, (2) each share of Common Stock subject to a full value award and granted after February 28, 2017 counts against
the Maximum Share Limit as 3.56 shares of Common Stock, and (3) if after February 28, 2017 any full value award expires, is canceled,
forfeited, cash-settled, exchanged or assumed by a third party or terminates for any other reason, in each case without a distribution
of shares of Common Stock to the participant, each share of Common Stock available under that award is added back to the pool of
shares available for grant as 3.56 shares of Common Stock. The plan caps the number of shares of Common Stock that may be awarded
to any individual in any calendar year under options or SARs at 1,000,000 and under any other stock-based award at 500,000, provided
that this cap is doubled in the initial year of hire. Cash-based awards under the plan are subject to an annual limit of $10 million
(which amount is doubled in the initial year of hire) per employee participant. The plan also caps the annual cash and equity compensation
(based on grant date fair value) that may be awarded to any individual, non-management director at $800,000 ($1,300,000 for any
non-management Board chair or vice chair (or similar role)). Prohibition on Share Recycling The following shares of Common Stock do not again
become available for awards or increase the number of shares available for grant under the plan: shares of Common Stock (1) tendered
by the participant or withheld by the Company in payment of the purchase price of an option or SAR, (2) tendered by the participant
or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation under the plan, (3) repurchased by the Company with proceeds
received from the exercise of an option, or (4) subject to a SAR that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of
that SAR upon its exercise. Minimum Vesting Requirement All equity awards granted following the date of
the Company’s 2017 annual meeting are subject to a minimum one-year vesting or performance requirement, except that (1) up
to five percent (5%) of the Maximum Share Limit may be issued without regard to this minimum vesting period, (2) this minimum vesting
period does not apply in the event of death, disability, retirement or other terminations of employment or service, and (3) the
Administrator may waive the minimum vesting requirement in the event of a substantial corporate change. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 81 Back to Contents Retirement and Other Terminations of Employment Subject to certain terms and conditions set forth
in the Omnibus Plan or the applicable award agreement (including the overall term of the award), in general: • upon retiring after reaching age 65, (1) a participant’s unvested options held for
    at least six months prior to retirement continue to vest and, together with any options that are vested as of the retirement
    date, remain outstanding and (once vested) may be exercised until the fifth anniversary of the retirement date (or the tenth
    anniversary with respect to grants made on or after January 1, 2022), (2) any RSUs that are unvested as of the retirement
    date (and, for grants on or after January 1, 2022, held for at least six months prior to retirement) continue to vest according
    to their terms, (3) for PSUs granted prior to January 1, 2022, the participant receives a prorated portion of the shares actually
    earned based on the Company’s performance over the performance period, and (4) for PSUs granted on or after January
    1, 2022 and held for at least six months prior to retirement, the participant receives the shares actually earned based on
    the Company’s performance over the performance period; and • upon retiring after reaching age 55 and completing ten years of service with Danaher: • with respect to grants on or after February 23, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2022, (1) a
    pro rata portion of the participant’s unvested options held for at least six months prior to retirement continue to
    vest and, together with any options that are vested as of the retirement date, remain outstanding and (once vested) may be
    exercised until the fifth anniversary of the retirement date, (2) a pro rata portion of any RSUs that are unvested as of the
    retirement date continue to vest according to their terms, and (3) with respect to PSUs, the participant receives a prorated
    portion of the shares actually earned based on the Company’s performance over the performance period. • with respect to grants on or after January 1, 2022 and held for at least six months prior
    to retirement, (1) the participant’s unvested options continue to vest and, together with any options that are vested
    as of the retirement date, remain outstanding and (once vested) may be exercised until the fifth anniversary of the retirement
    date, (2) any RSUs that are unvested as of the retirement date continue to vest according to their terms, and (3) the participant
    receives the PSU shares actually earned based on the Company’s performance over the performance period. Upon terminations of employment other than retirement
(as defined under the Omnibus Plan), unless the Administrator determines otherwise any options or SARs that are vested as of a
participant’s termination of employment (including any options or SARs the vesting of which accelerates as a result of the
participant’s death) will remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of the award’s term or (1) 12 months
after termination, if the termination results from the participant’s death or disability, (2) in the Administrator’s
discretion, at the time of termination if the participant’s employment is terminated for gross misconduct, or (3) 90
days following the termination date, in all other non-retirement situations. If an award survives for any period of time following
termination of employment, it will nonetheless terminate as of the date that the participant violates any post-employment covenant
between Danaher and the participant. In addition, upon termination of a participant’s employment or service due to death,
generally (1) all of the participant’s outstanding stock options granted under the Omnibus Plan become fully vested, (2)
the vesting of a pro rata portion of the participant’s outstanding RSUs is accelerated as of the date of death, and (3) with
respect to PSUs as to which the death occurs prior to conclusion of the performance period, the participant’s estate receives
a pro rata portion of the target number of shares underlying the PSUs. Substantial Corporate Change Upon a Substantial Corporate Change (which is
defined in the Omnibus Plan and includes a change-of-control of Danaher as defined therein), the Administrator has sole discretion
with respect to the treatment of outstanding awards. The Administrator may provide for the assumption and continuation of, or substitution
for, outstanding awards by a successor entity or may provide that the forfeitable portions of outstanding awards terminate. In
the latter case, the Administrator may provide that participants may exercise any unexercised awards prior to termination, may
provide for payments to participants in relation to the terminating awards, or may provide for neither of the above. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 82 Back to Contents Clawback Terms All awards granted under the Omnibus Plan are
subject to the Company’s clawback policies in the form or forms approved by the Administrator from time to time, if and to
the extent such policies apply according to their terms, as well as any clawback terms required by applicable law. Term of Plan Unless the Board extends the plan’s term,
the Administrator may not grant awards under the plan after May 9, 2027. Supplemental Retirement Program Company Contributions Danaher uses the Executive Deferred Incentive
Program, or EDIP, and the Excess Contribution Program, or ECP (which is a sub-plan under the 2007 Omnibus Plan) to provide supplemental
retirement benefits on a pre-tax basis in excess of qualified plan limitations to select management associates of Danaher and its
subsidiaries (including each of the named executive officers, as applicable). Prior to January 1, 2019, the EDIP was the sole plan
used by the Company to provide supplemental retirement benefits (and also served as a voluntary deferred compensation program).
The ECP became effective as of January 1, 2019 and prior to such date, EDIP participants made a one-time election to either continue
participating in the EDIP or participate in the ECP. All participants who join Danaher’s supplemental retirement program
at or after January 1, 2019 receive Company contributions under the ECP. All amounts that Danaher contributes to a participant’s
account in the EDIP and ECP are deemed invested on a notional basis in Danaher Common Stock. If termination of an employee’s
participation in the EDIP or ECP resulted from the employee’s gross misconduct, the Administrator may reduce the employee’s
vested interest with respect to all Danaher contributions to as low as zero percent. EDIP Under the EDIP, on or about February 1 of each
plan year, Danaher credits to the account of each EDIP participant an amount equal to the product of (1) the sum of the participant’s
base salary and target bonus as of the end of the prior year; and (2) a percentage determined by the Administrator that is based
on the participant’s years of participation in the EDIP, namely 6% for employees who have participated in the EDIP for less
than 10 years, 8% after 10 years of EDIP participation and 10% after 15 years of EDIP participation. A participant vests in the amounts that Danaher
credits to their EDIP account as follows: • If the participant has both reached age 55 and completed at least five years of service with
    Danaher or its subsidiaries, the participant immediately vests 100% in each Danaher contribution. • If the participant does not satisfy the conditions described under the preceding bullet,
    the participant’s vesting percentage is 10% for each full calendar year of participation in the EDIP (after the participant
    has first completed five years of participation in the EDIP). • If a participant dies while employed by Danaher, their vesting percentage equals 100%. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 83 Back to Contents ECP Under the ECP, on or about February
1 after the applicable year of participation, Danaher credits to the account of each participant an excess matching contribution
and excess non-elective contribution based on the formulas in the Company’s 401(k) plan for matching and non-elective contributions.
As a result, each participant can receive the following contributions in the ECP: • a matching contribution to the ECP equal
    to the sum of (a) 100% of the amount deferred into the Danaher Deferred Compensation Plan, or DCP for the year of participation,
    up to 3% of the greater of (1) the participant’s compensation that is deferred into the DCP or (2) the participant’s
    compensation above the IRS compensation limit for qualified retirement plans (“match compensation”), plus (b)
    50% of the amount deferred into the DCP for the year of participation in excess of 3%, but not in excess of 5%, of the participant’s
    match compensation; and • a non-elective contribution equal to 4% of
    the participant’s rate of base salary and target bonus amount as of December 31 prior to the year of participation in
    excess of the IRS compensation limit for qualified retirement plans. A participant vests in the matching contribution
in the ECP made each year on the first anniversary after it is credited to the participant’s account. A participant vests
in the non-elective contribution in the ECP made each year on the later of the first anniversary after it is credited to the participant’s
account, or the date the participant has completed three years of service with Danaher. If a participant dies while employed by
Danaher, their vesting percentage equals 100%. Voluntary Deferrals Each DCP participant is permitted to voluntarily
defer into the program, on a pre-tax basis, up to 85% of their salary and/ or up to 85% of their non-equity incentive compensation
with respect to a given plan year. Notional earnings on amounts deferred under the program are credited to participant accounts
based on the market rate of return of the applicable benchmark investment alternatives offered under the program, which are generally
the same as the investment alternatives offered under our 401(k) Plan (except for any investment options that may only be offered
under the tax qualified 401(k) Plan). Each participant allocates the amounts the participant voluntarily defers among the available
investment alternatives. Participants may change their allocations at any time, provided that any portion of a participant’s
account that is subject to the Danaher Common Stock investment alternative must remain allocated to that investment alternative
until the account is distributed to the participant. Participants are at all times fully vested in amounts they voluntarily defer
into their DCP accounts. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 84 Back to Contents Distributions In general, a participant may not receive a distribution
of their vested EDIP or ECP account balance (including any amounts voluntarily deferred) until after their employment with Danaher
terminates. A participant generally may elect to receive a distribution of their DCP account balance following their termination
of employment or on a specified future date prior to their termination of employment. The following chart generally describes the
timing and manner of distribution of EDIP, ECP and DCP account balances: Name

Lump sum Participant may elect lump sum, or if at least age 55, annual installments over two, five or ten years Participant may elect to receive distribution in cash, shares of Danaher Common Stock or a combination thereof (but all balances subject to the Danaher Common Stock investment alternative must be distributed in shares of Danaher Common Stock) ECP Participant will begin receiving distributions immediately following termination. A six-month delay may apply if the participant is a “key employee” under applicable tax rules Lump sum Shares of Danaher common stock (for balances subject to the Danaher Common Stock investment alternative) or cash (for balances not subject to the Danaher Common Stock investment alternative) DCP Participant may elect to begin receiving distributions on the earlier of a fixed date or termination of employment. Distributions on a fixed date must be at least 3 years after the date of election. Distribution elections upon a termination of employment are the same as under the EDIP Participant may elect lump sum or annual installments over a period of up to 10 years All balances subject to the Danaher Common Stock investment alternative must be distributed in shares of Danaher Common Stock, and all other balances must be paid in cash Certain events, such as the participant’s
death or an unforeseeable emergency, may impact the timing of a distribution under the EDIP, the ECP or the DCP. General Under the EDIP, the ECP and the DCP, Danaher contributions
and amounts voluntarily deferred are unfunded and unsecured obligations of Danaher, receive no preferential standing and are subject
to the same risks as any of Danaher’s other general obligations. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 85 Back to Contents Senior Leader Severance Pay Plan Each of Danaher’s executive officers (in
addition to certain other categories of employees as specified in the plan) is entitled to certain benefits under Danaher’s
Senior Leader Severance Pay Plan. If a covered employee is terminated without “cause” (as defined below) and except
in certain circumstances as specified in the plan, subject to execution of Danaher’s standard form of release the employee
is entitled to severance equal to a minimum of three months of annual base salary plus an additional month for each year of service
(provided that the three months plus all additional months cannot exceed twelve months in aggregate) paid out over the applicable
severance period according to the normal payroll cycle, as well as the opportunity to continue coverage under specified welfare
benefit plans of the Company for the duration of the severance period at the same cost as an active employee in a position similar
to that held by the employee at termination. There is no change-in control provision in the Senior Leader Severance Pay Plan. To
the extent a covered employee is entitled to severance or other post-termination compensation pursuant to the terms of an individual
agreement, payments and benefits will only be provided under the plan to the extent they are not duplicative of the payments and
benefits provided under the individual agreement. Under the plan, “cause” is defined
as (1) the employee’s dishonesty, fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement, willful misconduct or gross negligence with respect
to, or any other action in willful disregard of the interests of, Danaher or its affiliates; (2) the employee’s conviction
of, or pleading guilty or no contest to (i) a felony, (ii) any misdemeanor (other than a traffic violation), or (iii) any other
crime or activity that would impair the employee’s ability to perform duties or impair the business reputation of Danaher
or its affiliates; (3) the employee’s willful failure or refusal to satisfactorily perform any duties assigned to the employee;
(4) the employee’s failure or refusal to comply with Company standards, policies or procedures, including without limitation
the Code of Conduct as amended from time to time; (5) the employee’s violation of any restrictive covenant agreement with
Danaher or its affiliates; (6) the employee’s engaging in any activity that is in conflict with the business purposes
of Danaher or its affiliates (as determined in the sole discretion of Danaher and its affiliates); or (7) a material misrepresentation
or a breach of any of the employee’s representations, obligations or agreements under the plan. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 86 Back to Contents PROPOSAL 3 Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Compensation In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange
Act, we are asking our shareholders to vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our
named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. Our shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation occurs on
an annual basis. As discussed in detail under the heading “Compensation
Discussion and Analysis,” our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain executives with the leadership
skills, attributes and experience necessary to succeed in an enterprise with Danaher’s size, diversity and global footprint;
motivate executives to demonstrate exceptional personal performance and perform consistently at or above the levels that we expect,
over the long-term and through a range of economic cycles; and link compensation to the achievement of goals and objectives that
we believe best correlate with the creation of long-term shareholder value. We believe our executive compensation
program has been highly effective in achieving these objectives, both in 2023 and historically: 2023 Performance. In
2023, Danaher achieved critical milestones in its transformation into a global life sciences and diagnostics innovator: • We spun-off our Veralto business (consisting of Danaher’s former water quality and product identification businesses) into an independent, publicly-traded company, further sharpening our strategic focus on life sciences and diagnostics. • We acquired Abcam plc, a leading global supplier of protein consumables, for a cash purchase price of approximately $5.6 billion. Abcam is now included in our Life Sciences segment. Even while meaningfully advancing our strategic
transformation, we: • Continued to invest aggressively in future growth, including investments of approximately $1.5 billion in research and development and $1.4 billion in capital expenditures. • Returned approximately $778 million to common shareholders through cash dividends (marking the 31st year in a row Danaher has paid a dividend on its common shares). • Generated $23.9 billion in sales, $5.2 billion in operating profit and $6.5 billion in operating cash flow. Long-Term Performance. • As of December 31, 2023, out of the 220 companies in the S&P 500 that have been publicly traded since the beginning of 1985, Danaher’s annualized total shareholder return (“TSR”) ranks fourth. • Danaher is the only company in its peer group whose TSR outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 1,600 basis points over every rolling 5-year period from and including 1999-2023. • Danaher’s compounded average annual shareholder return has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over each of the last five-, ten-, fifteen-, twenty- and twenty-five year periods. 2024

    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 88 Back to Contents PROPOSAL 4 Shareholder Proposal The Company has been informed that John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo
Beach, CA, 90278, a beneficial owner of 150 shares of Danaher common stock, intends to present the proposal set forth below at
the Annual Meeting. The Company is not responsible for any inaccuracies it may contain. Proposal
4 -Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement Shareholders ask our board to take the steps necessary to amend the appropriate company
governing documents to give the owners of a combined 15% of our outstanding common stock the power to call a special shareholder
meeting. Currently it takes a theoretical 25% of all shares outstanding to call for a special
shareholder meeting. This theoretical 25% of all shares outstanding translates into 30% of the shares that vote at our annual
meeting. It would be hopeless to expect that shares that do not have the time to vote would have
the time to go through the special procedural steps to call for a special shareholder meeting. This proposal won 43%-support at the 2022 Danaher annual meeting for a lower 10% of shares
to be able to call for a special shareholder meeting. This 43% support likely represented close to or more than 51% support from
the shareholders who have access to independent proxy voting advice and are not forced to overly depend on the anti-shareholder
rights voting advice of management. In reflecting on the 43%-support it is important to remember that it takes more shareholder
conviction to ignore management’s recommendation and vote for this proposal topic than to simply vote as management directs. Since a special shareholder meeting can be useful in replacing a director, this proposal
may be an incentive for the Danaher directors to improve their performance. Danaher stock has gone downhill since its $290 price
in December 2021. Four Danaher directors each received more than 156 million against votes in 2023: Teri List Shane Sanders John Schwieters Raymond Steven This compares to 3 Danaher directors who each received less than 10 million against votes. Calling a special shareholder meeting is hardly ever used by shareholders but the main
point of calling a special shareholder meeting is that it gives shareholders at least significant standing to engage effectively
with management. With the widespread use of online shareholder meetings it is much easier for management
to conduct a special shareholder meeting and our bylaws thus need to be updated accordingly. Please vote yes: Special
Shareholder Meeting Improvement - Proposal 4 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 89 Back to Contents Company’s Statement in Opposition The Board recommends that you vote against this shareholder proposal for the following
reasons: Currently, shareholders of 25% of our outstanding Common Stock have the right to call
a special meeting, pursuant to a Company proposal previously approved by our shareholders. Our Board continues to believe that
this threshold ensures a reasonable number of shareholders consider a matter important enough to merit a special meeting. Preparing for and holding a special meeting (even in a virtual format) would be time-consuming
and expensive. If adopted, this proposal would have the effect of allowing a relatively small percentage of shareholders with
potentially narrow interests to call special meetings to consider matters that may not be in the best interests of all of our
shareholders. Even if they are ultimately not able to obtain support from a majority of shares, those who might seek to call a
special shareholders’ meeting could subject us to considerable expense, distract management and the Board from important
business initiatives, or seek self-interested concessions in exchange for avoiding a special meeting. Danaher’s Nominating and Governance Committee and Company management annually review
Danaher’s special meeting threshold, taking into account investor feedback as well as voting results in prior years when
similar proposals to reduce the threshold has been brought. Based on this review and these inputs, it was determined that the
existing 25% threshold continues to strike an appropriate balance between avoiding waste of Danaher and shareholder resources
on addressing narrow or special interests, while at the same time ensuring that shareholders holding a significant minority of
our outstanding shares have an appropriate mechanism to call a special meeting if they deem it appropriate. The Board also believes that Danaher’s current robust governance practices provide
shareholders with numerous avenues to voice their opinions and ensure Board accountability. We maintain open and regular communications
with shareholders and financial analysts, and our shareholders can and do effectively use our Annual Meeting of Shareholders to
communicate their views to management, the Board, and other shareholders. In the best interests of our shareholders and Company, we recommend that you vote against
this shareholder proposal. THE

    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 90 Back to Contents PROPOSAL 5 Shareholder Proposal The Company has been informed that As You Sow, on behalf of Eliana Fishman, 1833 9 th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001, beneficial owner of 36 shares of Danaher common stock, and Minnesota Valley National Wildlife
Refuge Trust, 3815 East American Boulevard, Bloomington, MN, 55425, beneficial owner of 129 shares of Danaher common stock, intends
to present the proposal set forth below at the Annual Meeting. The Company is not responsible for any inaccuracies it may contain. RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Danaher
Corp. (Danaher) report to shareholders on the effectiveness of the Company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The
report should be done at reasonable expense, exclude proprietary information, and provide transparency on outcomes, using quantitative
metrics for workforce diversity, hiring, promotion, and retention of employees, including data by gender, race, and ethnicity. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Quantitative data
is sought so that investors can assess and compare the effectiveness of companies’ diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. It is advised that this content be provided through Danaher’s existing sustainability
reporting infrastructure. An independent report specific to this topic is not requested. WHEREAS: Companies that release, or have
committed to release, more inclusion data than Danaher include Baxter International, Biogen, CVS Health, Gilead Sciences, Pfizer,
and UnitedHealth Group. As You Sow and Whistle Stop Capital released research in November 2023 that reviewed
over 4,500 EEO-1 reports, which show corporate workforce diversity. 1 The data shows a positive correlation between
manager diversity and corporate performance. Within the healthcare sector, statistically significant positive correlations were
found between increased manager diversity and free cash flow per share, income after tax, and ten-year revenue growth rate. The Company states it “sincerely hopes that [its] marginalized and underrepresented
associates feel supported and a sense of belonging...” 2 However, as of the date of the filing of this proposal,
Danaher had not yet shared sufficient hiring, retention, or promotion data to allow investors to determine the effectiveness of
its diversity and inclusion programs. As detailed below, inclusion indicators are important in assessing Danaher’s workplace
equity efforts and if the Company is successfully building, utilizing, and maintaining a diverse management team. Hiring: Studies conducted by economists
at the University of Chicago and UC Berkeley found that “discriminating companies tend to be less profitable,” stating
“it is costly for firms to discriminate against productive workers.” 3 Promotion: Without equitable promotional
practices, companies will be unable to build the necessary employee pipelines for diverse management. Women and employees of color
experience “a broken rung” in their careers; for every 100 men who are promoted, only 87 women are. Whereas women
of color comprise 18 percent of the entry-level workforce and only 6 percent of executives. 4 Retention: Retention rates indicate if
employees believe a company represents their best opportunity. Morgan Stanley has found that employee retention above industry
average can indicate a competitive advantage and higher levels of future profitability. 5 Investors have reason to be
concerned with Danaher as the Company was sued by a pension fund for its lack of diverse leadership. 6 Investors want
to be sure that Danaher’s diversity and inclusion actions are more than performative and that the Company is, in its words,
“working hard to build an organization that celebrates difference, learns from diverse perspectives, and values inclusion…” 7 1 https://www.asyousow.org/report-page/2023-positive-relationships-linking-workforce-diversity-and-financial-performance 2 https://www.danaher.com/who-we-are/diversity-inclusion 3 https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/business/economy/hiring-racial-discrimination.html 4 https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/women-in-the-workplace 5 https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/article_culturequantframework_us.pdf 6 https://news.bloomberglaw.com/social-justice/new-to-racial-justice-movement-a-pension-fund-sues-danaher 7 https://news.bloomberglaw.com/social-justice/new-to-racial-justice-movement-a-pension-fund-sues-danaher 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 91 Back to Contents Company’s Statement in Opposition • Overview • Danaher has demonstrated that diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE+I”) is a strategic
    priority with active support from the Board and executive management; has set ambitious DE+I improvement goals and made meaningful
    progress toward achieving those goals; and has been highly transparent in quantifying the performance of its DE+I program.
    We encourage you to review the extensive details regarding Danaher’s DE+I program included in our most recent sustainability
    report, which is available in the “Sustainability” section of Danaher’s website at http://www.danaher.com. • Given that Danaher’s extensive disclosures already give investors the data they need
    to assess the effectiveness of our DE+I program, the proponents’ request for additional reporting – including
    additional demographic data that few companies publish -- would be an unnecessary and inefficient use of resources that would
    serve only the limited interests of a small group of shareholders. • Though the proponent suggests Danaher’s public information
    is insufficient to assess the effectiveness of our DE+I program, As You Sow’s own Public 3000 Workplace
    Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Disclosure Scorecard ranked Danaher in the top 5% of the 3000 surveyed companies (and top 5% of the Health Care sector) as of December 31, 2023. • Leadership support. Danaher’s annual sustainability
    report demonstrates a strategic commitment to DE+I at the highest levels of our organization. Among other initiatives, we
    require every people leader (including our executive officers) to have a DE+I-related personal performance or development
    objective as part of our annual performance review process, and for the third straight year in 2023 we have deployed one of
    our most powerful DBS tools, Policy Deployment (“PD”), to drive continued progress toward our DE+I goals. PD’s
    rigorous “plan-do-check-adjust” approach has driven significant progress toward achievement of our DE+I goals,
    as evidenced by the results noted below. • Goals and progress. We have set ambitious, public goals to improve our gender and People of Color (“POC”) diversity and have demonstrated meaningful progress toward achieving these goals: • 2025 goal: 40% female representation in global workforce. As of December 31, 2023, 40% of Danaher’s employees were women. • 2025 goal: 38% POC representation in U.S. workforce. As of December 31, 2023, 43% of Danaher’s U.S. employees were POCs. • Transparency and quantitative data. We have been highly transparent in quantifying the performance of our DE+I program. We publicly disclose in our annual sustainability report: • Employee demographic data by gender, race and age • For each of gender and race, we disclose data on an overall basis and in sub-categories based
    on job level (and in the case of gender, by geography) – For the U.S., we provide even further granularity by disclosing job level
    detail for each EEOC race/ethnicity category. We also disclose our most recent U.S. Federal Employer Information Report (Form
    EEO-1) Employment Data. • New hire data by gender and (for the U.S.) People of Color • U.S. pay equity by gender and race • Since 2020, we have maintained pay equity for women and for racial and ethnic minorities
    in the U.S. with respect to salary and short-term incentive compensation. In 2022, we expanded our base pay analysis to cover
    approximately 95% of our global associates across 24 countries and achieved base pay equity for women. • Voluntary and involuntary turnover • Internal fill rate • Full-time, part-time and temporary employees • Conclusion. We are devoting significant time and resources to advancing our DE+I strategy and achieving our strategic DE+I objectives. Diverting those resources to address the proponents’ interest in additional reporting and additional demographic data that few companies publish would be inefficient and costly without adding significant value to our shareholders. In addition, As You Sow’s own top-5% ranking of Danaher’s DE+I disclosure practices suggest that Danaher’s disclosures already reflect the best practices espoused by the proponents. THE

in person, or may execute a proxy designating a representative to attend and vote on their behalf. If you do not hold your shares
directly with us and they are instead held for you in a brokerage, bank or other institutional account, you may attend and vote
in person if you obtain a proxy from that institution in advance of the meeting and bring it with you to hand in along with the
ballot that will be provided. 2024
    Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 94 Back to Contents Revoking a Proxy or Voting Instructions If you hold shares of Common Stock registered in your name, you may revoke your proxy: • by filing a written notice of revocation with the Secretary of Danaher; • if you submitted your proxy by telephone or via the Internet, by accessing those voting methods
    and following the instructions given for revoking a proxy; • if you submitted a signed proxy card, by submitting a new proxy card with a later date (which
    will override your earlier proxy card); or • by voting at the Annual Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you must follow the directions
provided by your bank, broker, trustee or other intermediary for revoking or modifying your voting instructions. Voting Procedures Each outstanding share of Danaher Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote on each
directorship and other matter brought before the Annual Meeting. Your shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions.
The Board has selected Steven M. Rales, Mitchell P. Rales, Brian W. Ellis and James F. O’Reilly, or any of them, to act
as proxies with full power of substitution. All votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the meeting. In addition, if you have returned a signed proxy card or submitted voting instructions
by telephone or online, the proxy holders will have, and intend to exercise, discretion to vote your shares (other than shares
held in the Savings Plan) in accordance with their best judgment on any matters not identified in this Proxy Statement that are
properly brought to a vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we do not know of any such additional
matters. If your shares are registered in your name and you sign and return a proxy card or vote
by telephone or online but do not give voting instructions on a particular matter, the proxy holders will be authorized to vote
your shares on that matter in accordance with the Board’s recommendation. If you hold your shares through an account with
a bank, broker, trustee or other intermediary and do not give voting instructions on a matter, we expect that under the rules
of the New York Stock Exchange the bank, broker, trustee or other intermediary will be permitted to vote in its discretion only
on Proposal 2 and will not be permitted to vote on any of the other Proposals, resulting in a so-called “broker non-vote.”
The impact of abstentions and broker non-votes on the overall vote is shown in the following table. Broker non-votes will not
affect the attainment of a quorum since the bank, broker, trustee or other intermediary has discretion to vote on Proposal 2 and
these votes will be counted toward establishing a quorum. 2024

of Danaher may solicit proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors by mail, email, in person and by telephone. These employees
will not receive any additional compensation for these activities. Danaher will bear the cost of soliciting proxies and will reimburse
banks, brokers, trustees and other intermediaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy materials to
shareholders. We have retained Broadridge Financial Services, Inc. to aid in distributing proxy materials and the solicitation
of proxies. For these services, we expect to pay Broadridge a fee of less than $15,000 and reimburse it for certain out-of-pocket
disbursements and expenses. Eliminating Duplicate Mailings Danaher has adopted the “householding” procedure approved by the SEC, which
allows us to deliver one set of documents to a household of shareholders instead of delivering a set to each shareholder in a
household, unless we have been instructed otherwise. This procedure is more environmentally friendly and cost-effective because
it reduces the number of copies to be printed and mailed. Shareholders who receive proxy materials in paper form will continue
to receive separate proxy cards/voting instruction forms to vote their shares. Shareholders who receive the Notice of Internet
Availability will receive instructions on submitting their proxy cards/voting instruction form via the Internet. If you would like to change your householding election, request that a single copy of
the proxy materials be sent to your address, or request a separate copy of the proxy materials, please contact our transfer agent
at 800-568-3476. We will promptly deliver the proxy materials to you upon receipt of your request. If you own your shares in “street
name,” please contact your broker, bank, trustee or other intermediary to make your request. If you receive more than one proxy card/voting instruction form, your shares probably
are registered in more than one account or you may hold shares both as a registered shareholder and through the Savings Plan.
You should vote each proxy card/voting instruction form you receive. 2024
