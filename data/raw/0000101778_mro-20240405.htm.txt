required by Item 25(b) per Exchange Act Rules 14a-6(i)(1) and 0-11 LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS April 10, 2024 Dear Marathon Oil Corporation Stockholder, In 2023, Marathon Oil again executed on every dimension of our Framework for Success, providing exceptional value to our stockholders. Within our high-quality E&P peer group, we delivered one of the highest free cash flow and stockholder distribution yields, the most growth in production per share, the strongest capital efficiency and the lowest reinvestment rate.  Most importantly, we achieved these results while staying true to our core values, highlighted by record safety performance and achieving our 2025 emissions intensity goal ahead of schedule, while also making significant progress across a broad array of social initiatives and governance expectations. Our proven strategy to prioritize free cash flow generation via disciplined reinvestment enabled us to return $1.7 billion of capital to our equity holders, or 41% of our adjusted cash flow from operations, fully consistent with our differentiated Return of Capital Framework that prioritizes our stockholders as the first call on capital. More specifically, we executed $1.5 billion of share repurchases in 2023, which led to a 9% reduction in outstanding share count. Since resuming our share repurchase program in October 2021, we have reduced our outstanding share count by more than 27%, driving peer-leading growth in our per-share metrics. Also, we raised our per-share base dividend by 22% last year while maintaining our focus on sustainability, as evidenced by our peer-leading post-dividend free cash flow breakeven. In addition to leading our sector in returning capital to stockholders, we also reduced our gross debt by $500 million in 2023, further improving our already investment-grade balance sheet. As we continued to advance our strategic objectives, our dedication to delivering results safely and responsibly remained a top priority. We achieved a significant milestone—a record-low Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of 0.21 for our employees and contractors. Our remarkable environmental performance for the year also reflected our commitment to operational excellence. We reached our 2025 greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity reduction goal of 50% 1 two years ahead of schedule. Furthermore, we improved our total gas capture rate to 99.5%, consistent with our journey of continuous improvement and our commitment to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring initiative by 2030. These achievements are emblematic of our execution excellence, founded in our strong financial position, high-quality assets and the unwavering dedication of our more than 1,600 employees. We are proud to have led our industry peers in the metrics that matter most and once again demonstrate that Marathon Oil is not only a compelling and differentiated player in the industry but also in the broader market. The world needs affordable and secure energy, and we believe oil and gas will be critical in meeting that demand for decades to come.  Marathon Oil is uniquely positioned to play its role in responsibly delivering that oil and gas while prioritizing corporate returns and underlying growth in per-share metrics, maintaining cost discipline, strengthening our balance sheet and continuing to prioritize safety and the environment. We believe the combination of our consistent, disciplined strategy, our differentiated execution, our high-quality U.S. multi-basin portfolio and our unique E.G. integrated gas business positions us to compete not only at the top of our energy peer group but with the very best companies in the S&P 500. To conclude, we would like to invite you to our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders that will be held on May 22, 2024, at 8 a.m. Central Time in the Level 6 Auditorium of One MRO, located at 990 Town & Country Blvd in Houston, Texas 77024.

Our U.S. assets are complemented by our international operations in Equatorial Guinea. Our overall business strategy is to responsibly deliver leading cash returns to stockholders which are sustainable long-term and resilient through all commodity price cycles. We expect to achieve our business strategy by adherence to a capital allocation framework that limits our capital expenditures relative to our expected cash flow from operations. We allocate capital to prioritize stockholder returns and per share growth, exercise discipline in reinvestment, retire outstanding debt and replenish inventory.  Being a safe and ethical operator mindful of our neighbors and communities is foundational to our business and for creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. Driven by talented people, innovation and a culture of continuous improvement, the future is ours to create. Committed to our Framework Corporate Returns Disciplined reinvestment in strongest rate-of-return opportunities Free Cash Flow Sustainable free cash flow across wide range of commodity prices Return of Capital Return meaningful capital to investors Differentiated Execution Continuously improve performance, reduce costs and deliver on commitments Powered by our Foundation Multi-Basin Portfolio Capital allocation flexibility, broad market access, supplier diversification, rapid sharing of best practices, platform for talent development Balance Sheet Strength Continue improving investment grade balance sheet; maintain financial strength and flexibility to execute business plan ESG Excellence Safety first, responsibly meeting global energy demand with strong environmental performance, trusted partner to local communities, best-in-class governance COMPREHENSIVE DELIVERY IN 2023 2023 marked another year of impressive delivery against every dimension of our Framework for Success.  We generated approximately $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow, returned $1.7 billion of capital back to our stockholders and reduced gross debt by $500 million, further improving our investment grade balance sheet. Within our high-quality E&P peer group, we delivered among the best free cash flow and stockholder distribution yields, the most growth in production per share, the strongest capital efficiency and the lowest reinvestment rate. These results are a strong testament to the quality of our multi-basin portfolio, the discipline in our capital allocation framework and the hard work of all of our employees.  Most importantly, we delivered these outstanding results while holding true to our core values: reporting a record year for safety performance, achieving our 2025 GHG intensity reduction goal 1 two years ahead of schedule and further improving our natural gas capture. 1 GHG intensity reduction goal of 50% is relative to 2019 GHG intensity baseline. 1     MARATHON OIL | ABOUT MARATHON OIL CORPORATION FOCUS ON ESG We believe in the importance of delivering financial outcomes and ESG excellence that are competitive not only with our direct E&P peers but with the broader market as well.

MARATHON OIL | ABOUT MARATHON OIL CORPORATION     4 PROXY OVERVIEW VOTING ROADMAP Our Board’s Recommendation Proposal No. 1:  Election of Directors FOR Our Board of Directors believes that all of the director nominees listed in the Proxy Statement have the requisite qualifications to provide effective oversight of the Company’s business and management. Pg 6 Proposal No. 2:  Ratification of Independent Auditor for 2024 FOR Our Audit and Finance Committee and Board of Directors believe that the retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2024 is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Pg 66 Proposal No. 3:  Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of our Named Executive Officers FOR We are seeking a non-binding, advisory vote to approve, and our Board of Directors recommends the approval of, the 2023 compensation paid to our named executive officers, which is described in the section of this Proxy Statement entitled “Executive Compensation.” Pg 68 Proposal No. 4:  Approve an Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Provide for the Exculpation of Officers FOR We are seeking approval of an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to provide for the limitation or elimination of the personal liability of an officer for monetary damages for certain breaches of fiduciary duty as an officer involving breaches of the duty of care, as permitted by recent amendments to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL). Pg 69 5     MARATHON OIL | PROXY OVERVIEW PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS Under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, directors are elected for terms expiring at the next succeeding Annual Meeting of stockholders.  We currently have eight (8) directors whose terms expire in 2024, each of whom is nominated for a one-year term expiring at the 2025 Annual Meeting. Directors are elected by a majority of votes cast. For a director to be elected, the number of shares cast “FOR” a director must exceed the number of votes cast “AGAINST” that director.  Abstentions will have no effect in director elections.  If any nominee for whom you have voted becomes unable to serve, your proxy may be voted for another person designated by our Board. Our By-laws require any incumbent who does not receive sufficient votes to promptly tender his or her resignation to our Board.  Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will recommend to our Board whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation or take other action.  Our Board will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee’s recommendation, and publicly disclose its decision regarding the tendered resignation within 90 days after certification of the election results. In the event of a vacancy, our Board may fill the position or decrease the size of our Board. DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS AND NOMINATIONS Our Corporate Governance Principles set forth the process for director selection and director qualifications.  In summary, the chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the CEO and the Secretary of the Company work, often with a third-party professional search firm, to review director candidates and their credentials when the Board believes there is a need.  At least one member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Independent Lead Director and the CEO meet with the potential director candidate.  This screening process applies to nominees recommended by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, as well as nominees recommended by our stockholders in accordance with our By-laws or applicable law.  Once a director has been selected either by our Board to serve until the next annual meeting or by election at the annual meeting, they undergo orientation and training.  The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for reviewing with our Board the appropriate skills and characteristics required of directors.  Directors should be individuals of substantial accomplishment with demonstrated leadership capabilities, and they should represent all stockholders rather than any special interest group or constituency.  Selection of director nominees includes a consideration of numerous skills and qualifications, including: » an evaluation of their independence; » their business or professional experience; » their integrity and judgment; » their record of public service; » their ability to devote sufficient time to the affairs of the Company; » their diversity, including diversity of backgrounds and experience they will bring to our Board; and » the Company’s needs at that particular time. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE All of our directors, other than our CEO, are independent.  In accordance with applicable laws, regulations, our Corporate Governance Principles and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Board must affirmatively determine the independence of each director and director nominee.  The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers all relevant facts and circumstances including, without limitation, transactions during the previous year between the Company and the director directly, immediate family members of the director, organizations with which the director is affiliated and the frequency and dollar amounts associated with these transactions.  The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee further MARATHON OIL | PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS     6 considers whether the transactions were at arm’s length in the ordinary course of business and whether the transactions were consummated on terms and conditions similar to those of unrelated parties.  The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee then makes a recommendation to the Board with respect to the independence of each director and director nominee. As part of the determination, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board considered that certain of the directors serve or previously served together on not-for-profit boards of charitable organizations and that the Company made various contributions to certain charitable organizations that the directors are associated with.  The Board also took into account that certain entities affiliated or previously affiliated with the directors received payments or paid amounts to the Company in ordinary course business transactions that were at arm’s length. Based on these considerations, the standards in our Corporate Governance Principles and the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board determined that Chadwick C. Deaton, Marcela E. Donadio, M. Elise Hyland, Holli C. Ladhani, Mark A. McCollum, Brent J. Smolik and Shawn D. Williams are independent.  J. Kent Wells also served as an independent director during 2023, until the end of his term on May 24, 2023.  As CEO of the Company, Mr. Tillman is not independent. DIRECTOR DIVERSITY The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for reviewing with our Board the appropriate size and composition of the Board. When considering the director nominees, our Board will look at a diverse pool of candidates.  We view and define diversity in its broadest sense, which we believe includes gender, ethnicity, age, education, experience and leadership qualities.  The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews each candidate’s business or professional experience, demonstrated leadership ability, integrity and judgment, record of public service, diversity, financial and technological acumen and international experience before recommending a candidate to the Board.  Below is a summary of the Board diversity for the directors who are standing for reelection. Board Gender, Ethnicity, Independence, Tenure and Age Diversity GENDER ETHNICITY Three of our eight director nominees, including the Lead Director and the current chairs of the Audit and Finance and HESCR Committees, are female. 25% of our director nominees self-identify as an ethnicity other than Caucasian/White. INDEPENDENCE TENURE AGE The Board has determined that each of the nominees, other than Mr. Tillman, meet the NYSE’s independence standards. We believe the mix between short- and long-tenured directors reflects a balance of company experience and new perspectives. The average age of the director nominees is 63 years. 7     MARATHON OIL | PROPOSAL 1:  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS BOARD SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE DIVERSITY MATRIX Our directors have a diversity of experience and skills that span a broad range of industries in the public and not-for-profit sectors.  They bring to our Board a wide variety of skills, qualifications and viewpoints that strengthen our Board’s ability to carry out its oversight role on behalf of our stockholders.  The table below summarizes key qualifications, skills and attributes each director that is standing for reelection brings to our Board.  The lack of a mark for a particular item does not mean the director does not possess that qualification or skill.  However, a mark indicates a specific area of focus or expertise that the director brings to our Board.  More details on each director’s qualifications, skills and attributes as of April 10, 2024 are included in the director biographies on the subsequent pages.

Our Board recognizes that service on other boards of directors often broadens and deepens the knowledge and experience of our directors, while also understanding that service on too many boards can potentially interfere with a director’s ability to perform his or her responsibilities.  Under our Corporate Governance Principles, when considering an additional board position, a director should take into account all his or her current commitments, including any existing directorships and board leadership roles, and determine whether the acceptance of a new directorship will compromise his or her ability to perform present responsibilities.  Furthermore, before accepting an additional public board position, a director will notify the Chairman of the Board or the Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, so that the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board may evaluate the impacts of such additional commitment as it relates to his or her present duties to the Company.  In such event, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the full Board will consider potential conflicts of interest and the nature of, and time commitment relating to, a director’s service on all boards in evaluating whether the new directorship would interfere with such director’s ability to properly discharge his or her duties to the Company.  When reviewing a director’s other board commitments, consideration is given to any public company board leadership positions (e.g., committee chair, lead director). Notwithstanding the foregoing evaluation, under our Corporate Governance Principles, any director who serves on the board of directors of more than three (3) other public companies shall not be nominated for reelection to the Company’s Board at the next annual meeting of stockholders.  Any director who is also an executive officer of a public company and serves on the board of directors of more than one (1) other public company shall not be nominated for reelection to the Company’s Board at the next annual meeting of stockholders.  Any member of the Company’s Audit and Finance Committee who serves on the audit committee of more than two (2) other public companies shall be removed as a member of the Audit and Finance Committee.  Prior to initial appointment to the Company’s Board, and in connection with the annual nomination of candidates for election or reelection to the Board, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews and considers each candidate’s outside director time commitments prior to making its recommendation to the full Board for nomination to stand for election or reelection to the Board.  All directors standing for reelection are currently in compliance with the Company’s policy on director commitments. 9     MARATHON OIL | PROPOSAL 1:  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR EACH NOMINEE Chadwick C.

The Independent Lead Director presides at these meetings.  In addition, our Corporate Governance Principles require that all our principal committees be comprised of entirely independent directors.  Marcela E. Donadio has served as Independent Lead Director since May 26, 2021. INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR LEADERSHIP As Independent Lead Director, Ms. Donadio is responsible for: » presiding at executive sessions of independent directors; » reviewing with Mr. Tillman the proposed Board and committee meeting agendas; » serving as a liaison between the independent directors and Mr. Tillman in discussing issues from the independent executive sessions and ensuring the flow of information; » reviewing and recommending to Mr. Tillman the retention of consultants who report directly to our Board or committees thereof; » overseeing Board performance; and » establishing, together with Mr. Tillman, effective communications with Company stakeholders. MARATHON OIL | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE     18 BOARD AND COMMITTEE EVALUATIONS Each year, our Board performs a rigorous full Board evaluation.  In addition, each committee also performs an annual evaluation.  The evaluation process is managed by the Secretary’s office with oversight from the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. For 2023, the evaluation process consisted of: þ Evaluation questionnaires - each director and committee member completed a formal questionnaire. This allows each director and committee member to identify potential improvements. þ Board and committee discussions - the Board and each committee met in Executive Session to discuss the results of the evaluation questionnaires. þ Individual Discussions - our Independent Lead Director met with directors individually to discuss key take-aways and action items from the evaluation results, solicited additional feedback and then communicated next steps back to the office of the Corporate Secretary, as appropriate. þ Feedback to Board and Chairman - the Independent Lead Director met separately with the Chairman to review feedback from the internal evaluations and then the Chairman and the Independent Lead Director discussed the feedback with the Board. þ Implementation of feedback - as a result of the evaluation process, the Board and the Secretary’s office implemented certain changes to Board and committee processes and agendas. OUR BOARD’S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT While our Board and its committees oversee risk management, Company management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risk.  We have a robust enterprise risk management process for identifying, assessing and managing risk and monitoring risk mitigation strategies.  Our CEO, CFO and a committee of executive officers and senior managers work across the business to manage each enterprise level risk and to identify emerging risks.  Our Audit and Finance Committee annually reviews our enterprise risk management process and our Board annually reviews the outputs of that process, including the latest assessment of risks and key mitigation strategies.  Responsibility for risk oversight by our Board and its committees is delegated as set forth below: » The Audit and Finance Committee receives regular updates from senior leadership on specific risks identified in the risk management process.  These reviews with senior leadership include risks associated with financial and accounting matters and reporting, as well as cyber-security.  The Audit and Finance Committee also monitors compliance with legal and certain regulatory requirements and internal control systems, and reviews risks associated with financial strategies and the Company’s capital structure.  Protecting the privacy of our systems and networks has long been, and will continue to be, a priority. Our Senior Vice President, Technology & Innovation, and Chief Information Officer, who oversees our cybersecurity program, regularly provides reports to senior leadership and the Audit and Finance Committee regarding our ongoing assessment of cyber-security threats and risks, data security programs designed to prevent and detect threats, attacks, incursions and breaches, as well as management, mitigation and remediation of potential, and any actual, cyber-security and information technology risks and breaches.  In addition, the Audit and Finance Committee and management review reports from internal audit regarding evaluation of our information technology department on a regular basis. » The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews the Board’s and Company’s governance policies and procedures to ensure adherence to best practices and legal requirements. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee also reviews director succession planning, director outside 19     MARATHON OIL | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE commitments and committee assignments to ensure the directors’ skills and backgrounds are utilized to the best interests of the Company and they are able to devote the significant time and attention necessary to fulfill their duties as a director. » The Compensation Committee reviews the executive compensation program to ensure it does not encourage excessive risk-taking.  It also reviews our executive compensation, incentive compensation and succession plans to ensure we have appropriate practices in place to support the retention and development of the talent necessary to achieve our business goals and objectives. » The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee regularly reviews and oversees operational risks, including those relating to health, environment, safety, security and climate change.  It reviews risks associated with social, political and environmental trends, issues and concerns, domestic and international, which affect or could affect our business activities, performance and reputation, and monitors climate-related trends, issues, legislation, regulations, policies, practices and concerns. Our Board receives regular updates from the committees about these activities, and reviews additional risks not specifically within the purview of any particular committee and risks of a strategic nature.  Key risks associated with the strategic plan are reviewed annually at our Board’s strategy meeting and periodically throughout the year. RISK ASSESSMENT RELATED TO OUR COMPENSATION STRUCTURE The Compensation Committee regularly evaluates and considers the role of our executive compensation program in ensuring that our executive officers are incentivized to only take appropriate and prudent risks, and that compensation opportunities do not motivate excessive risk-taking.  The practices we employ include: » All executive officer compensation decisions are made by either the Compensation Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors or, for CEO target compensation, by the independent directors. » The Compensation Committee is advised by an independent compensation consultant that performs no other work for executive management or our Company. » Our executives do not have employment agreements. » The Compensation Committee manages our compensation program to be competitive with those of peer companies and also monitors our program against trends in executive compensation on an annual basis against the broader energy industry and general industry of similar market capitalization. » Our compensation program is intended to balance short-term and long-term incentives. » Our long-term incentives feature multiple award vehicles and multi-year vesting criteria aligned with long-term ownership, and our executive officers are also subject to ongoing stock ownership requirements. » Our annual cash bonus program is based on a balanced set of quantitative metrics and qualitative objectives. In addition, the Compensation Committee generally considers the achievement of individual performance goals and overall corporate performance. » Annual cash bonuses are paid to executive officers only after the Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed audited financial statements for the performance year. » Annual cash bonuses and performance share unit awards are subject to a maximum opportunity. » The Compensation Committee regularly evaluates share utilization in our 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan by reviewing overhang levels (dilutive impact of equity compensation on our stockholders) and annual run rates (the aggregate shares awarded as a percentage of total outstanding shares). MARATHON OIL | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE     20 » We maintain two compensation clawback policies.  One applies to annual cash bonuses and is generally triggered with respect to an executive officer in the event of a material accounting restatement due to noncompliance with financial reporting requirements or an act of fraud by that executive officer.  Our long-term incentive awards for executive officers have similar provisions.  During 2023, we also adopted a clawback policy to comply with the Dodd-Frank clawback requirements, which applies to incentive-based compensation, and is generally triggered with respect to an executive officer in the event of an accounting restatement. Our 2023 compensation program for our named executive officers followed the above risk assessment.  See the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section for additional details. HEALTH, ENVIRONMENTAL, SAFETY AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Managing Risk to Operate Responsibly Our Board’s key oversight role includes reviewing the sustainability of our enterprise and the strength of our risk management efforts. As mentioned above, our four standing committees assist with this oversight. The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee plays a vital role in reviewing our operational risks, including those relating to health, environment, safety, security and climate change and includes directors with experience in this area. Minimizing Our Environmental Impact Environmentally responsible, compliant operations are central to our company values and a key part of our commitment to stakeholders.  We actively work to mitigate our operational impacts on the air, water and sensitive habitats and reduce our environmental footprint. » Climate change risk - We recognize the impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) and other air emissions on global climate and air quality.  As part of our commitment to sustainability and managing climate-related risks, we’ve established business processes that we continue to evaluate and refine to reduce our emissions and mitigate both current and future energy transition risks to our business.  Engaging with external stakeholders to understand their perspectives is a vital component of this effort.  In addition, we have made, and intend to continue to make, investments in technologies and processes to drive improvement.  Our corporate scorecard sets forth metrics and targets that incentivize achieving our goals and are linked to executive and employee pay, such as a climate-related metric first added in 2020. » Reducing air emissions from our operations - We aim to help meet global oil and gas demand while also demonstrating strong environmental performance by driving significant improvement to both the Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) and methane intensity of our operations, consistent with the trajectory of the Paris Climate Agreement.  We have a history of taking proactive measures to reduce air emissions, including utilizing next-generation facility designs aimed at minimizing flaring, removing intermittent-bleed pneumatic controllers and using electric-driven compression.  We continue to evaluate emissions reduction technologies that address the specific needs and constraints of each of our assets and that supplement compliance efforts associated with new and proposed regulations. To highlight our commitment to successfully meeting global energy demand while demonstrating strong environmental performance, in early 2022, we introduced new quantitative goals for the near, medium and longer-term horizon across three core areas of focus:  Scopes 1 and 2 GHG intensity, methane intensity and gas capture.  These Company goals complement our Scopes 1 and 2 GHG intensity reduction goal of 50% by 2025, relative to 2019 baseline, which we adopted in 2021.  These goals are intended to promote external transparency and accountability while also enhancing the internal alignment and employee innovation necessary to deliver strong environmental performance. 21     MARATHON OIL | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE During 2023, we realized significant progress against our core environmental objectives and achieved our 2025 GHG intensity reduction goal of 50% 1 two years ahead of schedule.  Additionally, we improved our total Company gas capture to 99.5% and continue to make progress toward our World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 commitment. » Applying water stewardship practices - We aim to limit fresh water use and practice responsible water sourcing, reuse, recycling and proper disposal.  Our regional water management strategy is designed to reduce the impacts of our water use on stakeholders and the relevant watersheds, and to minimize risks associated with produced water disposal, supply sourcing and business interruption.  We target opportunities that conserve fresh water for community needs while reducing business risk linked to access to water resources. Creating Safe, Healthy and Secure Workplaces We hold safety as a core value and key component of our ESG performance.  We strive to provide safe, healthy and secure workplaces by maintaining strong safety performance, as measured by Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) for both employees and contractors.  We continuously work to improve our procedures, train our workforce to reduce safety risk, reinforce our strong safety culture and build relationships with our contractor workforce.  During 2023, we achieved a record low annual TRIR of 0.21.  Our safety performance for both employees and contractors remains a key component of our executive compensation scorecard, underscoring our commitment to keeping our employees and contractors safe.  In addition, we believe our workforce is trained and ready to respond if natural disasters, security incidents, operational disruptions or other events occur, and we maintain detailed business continuity plans to protect our workforce and continue critical business functions during sustained efforts, including a public health event such as a pandemic. Social Investment We are committed to promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace, respecting human rights and making strategic investments to build healthier, safer, more resilient and stronger local communities. As of December 31, 2023, women accounted for 30% of our U.S. full-time workforce and people of color  accounted for 32% of our U.S. full-time workforce.  During 2023, we published our Equal Opportunity and Employment (EEO-1) data and in 2022 we released a new Human Rights Policy to further acknowledge our longstanding commitment to the dignity and rights of all people. Key strategic social investments during 2023 included the following: » Ongoing support of Equatorial Guinea’s Bioko Island Malaria Elimination Project. » Partnering with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation on grassland restoration projects in the Bakken. » Awarding grants to teachers through the Unconventional Thinking in Teaching Program, helping to increase teacher retention and amplify the impact of qualified teachers on the future workforce in the Company’s area of operations. » Continued support of the My Home Library Program book distribution events with Barbara Bush Houston Literacy Foundation, helping address the reading gap in underserved communities. 1 GHG intensity reduction goal of 50% is relative to 2019 GHG intensity baseline.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION Ms. Donadio and Messrs. Deaton, McCollum and Smolik served on the Compensation Committee for all of 2023.  Mr. Wells served on the Compensation Committee during 2023, until his departure from the Board in May 2023, at which time Mr. McCollum was appointed Chair of the Compensation Committee.  There are no matters relating to interlocks or insider participation that we are required to report. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION Our Board determines annual retainers and other compensation for non-employee directors.  Mr. Tillman, the only director who is also an employee, receives no additional compensation for his service on our Board or as Chairman.  Non-employee director compensation is intended to attract qualified directors, ensure that they are fairly compensated for their contributions to our performance and align the interests of directors and stockholders. CASH COMPENSATION Our Board is committed to best-in-class corporate governance, including director compensation.  Below are the 2023 non-employee director annual cash retainer and fees, which have not changed since January 2021. Lead Director and Committee Chair Fees for 2023 Amount paid ($) Annual Board Retainer $95,000 Additional Fee for Independent Lead Director $20,000 Additional Fee for Audit and Finance Committee Chair $20,000 Additional Fee for Compensation Committee Chair $20,000 Additional Fee for Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee Chair $12,500 Additional Fee for Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Chair $12,500 Directors do not receive meeting fees for attendance at Board or committee meetings.  Non-employee directors may defer up to 100% of their annual retainer into an unfunded account under the Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (DCP).  These deferred amounts may be invested in certain investment options, which generally mirror the investment options offered to employees under the Marathon Oil Company Thrift Plan (Thrift Plan). MARATHON OIL | DIRECTOR COMPENSATION     24 EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS For 2023, each non-employee director received an annual common stock unit award valued at $200,000, which was credited to an account on March 1, 2023, based on the closing stock price on the grant date.  These awards were granted under the Company’s 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan (2019 ICP), which is described in further detail under “Long-Term Incentives” in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis”.  Directors may elect to defer settlement of their common stock units until after they cease serving on our Board under the Company’s DCP.  Directors who make such a deferral election receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional common stock units, which will be settled in common stock. Directors who elect not to defer their common stock units receive dividend equivalents in cash, payment of which is deferred until the distribution date of the related common stock units.  These awards vest and are payable shortly after the earlier of (a) the first anniversary of the grant date or (b) the director’s departure from our Board. Director stock ownership requirement of 5x annual cash retainer Our stock ownership guidelines require each non-employee director to hold five times the value of his or her annual cash retainer in Marathon Oil stock.  Directors have five years from their initial election to our Board to meet this requirement.  Directors who do not hold the required level of stock ownership due to fluctuations in the price of our common stock are expected to hold the awards they receive until they have met their requirement.  The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews each non-employee director’s progress toward the requirements during the first quarter of each year to determine whether the market value of the shares, including the value of deferred shares and restricted stock units, satisfies our requirements.  As of March 25, 2024, Mses. Donadio, Hyland and Ladhani, and Messrs. Deaton and Smolik meet the requisite threshold.  Messrs. McCollum and Williams are still within the five-year window. MATCHING GIFTS PROGRAMS Under our matching gifts programs, we will annually match up to $10,000 in contributions made by non-employee directors to certain tax-exempt educational institutions.  This annual limit is based on the date of the director’s gift to the institution.  We will also make a donation to a charity of the director’s choice equal to the amount of his or her contribution to the Marathon Oil Company Employees Political Action Committee (MEPAC) for contributions above $200.  MEPAC contributions are subject to a $5,000 annual limit. 2023 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE Name Fees Earned or Paid in Cash Stock Awards (1) All Other Compensation (2) Total Chadwick C.

How We Determine Executive Compensation 33 VI. 2023 Executive Compensation Program Elements 35 This Compensation Discussion and Analysis focuses on the Company’s 2023 compensation program, actions and results relative to the Company’s 2023 performance. Those outcomes considered the 2023 safety, environmental, financial and operating achievements against plan objectives and stock price performance on an absolute and relative basis through the end of 2023.  The following measures referenced in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis are non-GAAP measures: (1) adjusted free cash flow; (2) adjusted cash flow from operations (adjusted CFO); (3) reinvestment rate; and (4) cash flow per debt adjusted share. For each such non-GAAP measure, reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and related definitions and discussion regarding their usefulness are included in Annex A. 2023 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2023, the Company achieved impressive delivery against every dimension of our Framework for Success, as evidenced by our outsized free cash flow generation, differentiated return of capital back to stockholders and reduction of gross debt, further improving our investment grade balance sheet.  Most importantly, we achieved these results while keeping our workforce safe and delivering comprehensive ESG excellence. 29     MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Framework for Success 2023 Operational and Financial Highlights 2023 marked another year in which Marathon Oil delivered outstanding operational and financial results, while maintaining strong safety and environmental performance.  The Company’s employees delivered these impressive and comprehensive results against our Framework for Success. Key 2023 Highlights Include: » We delivered record annual safety performance, as measured by TRIR. » We generated approximately $2.2 billion of free cash flow (before changes in working capital and including Equatorial Guinea (E.G.) distributions) (adjusted free cash flow). » We returned 41% of net operating cash flow (before changes in working capital) (adjusted CFO) to stockholders in 2023. » We distributed $1.7 billion to stockholders. » We executed $1.5 billion of share repurchases, driving a 9% reduction to our outstanding shares of common stock. » We increased our per share base dividend 22% from the year-end 2022 level, with no impact on our peer-leading post dividend free cash flow breakeven. » We reduced gross debt by $500 million, further strengthening our investment grade balance sheet. » We successfully integrated Ensign into the Eagle Ford asset team. » We delivered impressive commercial achievements in E.G., including signing an HOA with the Republic of E.G. and our partner to progress the development of the E.G. Regional Gas Mega Hub.  In addition, we entered into a five-year firm LNG sales agreement indexed to global LNG pricing (in contrast to the legacy Henry Hub linked contract) for a portion of our equity natural gas produced from Alba Field (Alba Unit, MRO 64% working interest), effective January 1, 2024, which is expected to drive significant improvement in 2024 financial performance for our E.G. Integrated Gas Business. » We achieved full year 2023 oil and oil-equivalent production of 190,000 net barrels of oil per day (bopd) and 405,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). » We achieved these operational and financial results while also improving our gas capture rate to 99.5% and achieving a 2025 GHG intensity reduction of approximately 50% (relative to the 2019 GHG intensity baseline) two years ahead of schedule. » We strategically invested to build healthier, safer, more resilient and stronger local communities. MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     30 PAY FOR PERFORMANCE Our executive compensation program creates a strong alignment with stockholder interests.  The largest portion of NEO compensation is delivered through equity-based, long-term incentives that tie compensation to the absolute and relative performance of our stock and sustainable generation of cumulative free cash flow.  Our annual bonus delivers payments directly aligned with performance against our safety, environmental, financial and operational commitments each year. The compensation that Mr. Tillman, our CEO, will realize from his outstanding awards and opportunities aligns well with stock price and Company performance. His reported pay, as detailed in the Summary Compensation Table, does not reflect the actual value he realizes from at-risk incentive opportunities. Mr. Tillman’s realizable compensation from the total opportunities awarded from 2021 through 2023 aligns well with stock price performance on an annual and a cumulative three-year basis.  The bar charts below compare Mr. Tillman’s realizable compensation as a percent of target opportunity to our annual total shareholder return (TSR) performance and his cumulative realizable pay to cumulative TSR performance over the period. Realizable compensation for each year includes each year’s base salary paid, actual annual bonus earned and the year-end value of each year’s long-term incentive (LTI) awards.  The cumulative realizable pay numbers include the value of all equity granted over the period as of December 31, 2023.  Target compensation represents annual salary rate, target bonus opportunity and target grant value of LTI awards. CEO REALIZABLE PAY ALIGNED WITH PERFORMANCE 31     MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY Our success is based on safety, environmental and financial performance and operational results, and we believe that our executive compensation program is an important driver of that success. The primary objectives of our program are as follows: Pay for performance Our program is designed to reward executives for their performance and motivate them to continue to perform at a high level. Cash bonuses based on annual performance, combined with equity awards that vest over several years, balance short-term and long-term business objectives. Encourage creation of long-term stockholder value Equity awards and stock ownership requirements align our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders. Our NEOs’ LTI awards feature equity-based grants with large portions tied to financial performance and long-term stockholder returns. Pay competitively We provide market-competitive pay levels to attract and retain the best talent, and we regularly benchmark each component of our pay program, including our benefit programs, to ensure we remain competitive. COMPENSATION GOVERNANCE AND BEST PRACTICES The Compensation Committee (Committee) periodically evaluates market best practices and pay programs at other companies and modifies our compensation program as necessary.  The Committee seeks to provide balanced incentives, while managing compensation risks appropriately in the context of our business objectives.  Our program incorporates the following best practices: WHAT WE DO WHAT WE DON’T DO þ Emphasize at-risk compensation designed to link pay to performance; all LTI vehicles denominated in shares and majority of LTI value is in the form of performance unit awards ý Offer employment agreements to our executive officers þ Include ESG metrics in annual incentive compensation design to further align with stakeholder interest ý Provide gross-up payments to cover excess parachute payment excise taxes for executive officers þ Maintain stock ownership requirements for executive officers and directors ý Allow margin, derivative or speculative transactions with our company stock, such as hedges, pledges and margin accounts, by executive officers and directors þ Maintain “double-trigger” change in control cash severance payments and accelerated vesting of certain equity awards ý Reward executives for excessive, inappropriate or unnecessary risk-taking þ Incorporate compensation clawback provisions in annual and long-term incentives and maintain a policy to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act clawback requirements þ Offer minimal use of perquisites and no related tax gross-ups þ Proactively engage with our stockholders on compensation, environmental and governance issues þ Engage an independent compensation consultant to advise the Committee þ Dedicate significant time each year to robust executive succession planning and leadership development MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     32 2023 Say on Pay and Stockholder Engagement The Committee considers the outcomes of the Company’s advisory stockholder vote on our executive compensation program and any associated outreach initiatives when making compensation decisions. At our 2023 Annual Meeting, our stockholders expressed support for the Company’s proposals, and all our agenda items were approved.  Within those approvals, approximately 94% of shares voted were in favor of our 2023 “say-on-pay” agenda item.  Overall, investor feedback has been positive regarding our executive compensation program and its link between our pay and performance. 2023 “Say-on-Pay” Support 94% The Company is committed to regular communication and engagement with its stockholders and other stakeholders.  During 2023, we engaged with and solicited valuable feedback from a broad base of investors on various topics, such as compensation, environmental and social issues and governance practices. Feedback from these meetings is shared with directors through senior management reports to the Board and its committees throughout the year. We remain committed to engaging stockholders regularly and to ensuring alignment of our compensation program with stockholder and other stakeholders’ interests. HOW WE DETERMINE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Compensation Committee The Committee is responsible for establishing and overseeing our executive compensation program and policies that are consistent with our overall compensation philosophy.  In making such decisions, the Committee considers a variety of factors, including stockholder feedback, information provided by its independent compensation consultant, our CEO’s input, peer group and broader industry data, each executive’s experience in the role, Company and individual performance, internal pay equity and any other information the Committee deems relevant in its discretion. Compensation Consultant For 2023, the Committee directly engaged Meridian Compensation Partners LLC (Meridian) as its independent compensation consultant to advise the Committee on executive compensation matters.  Meridian provides the Committee with information on items such as emerging industry trends (in oil and gas, as well as broader energy and general industries), legislative issues, defining the Company’s peer group and benchmarking our executive compensation program against the compensation peer group.  Meridian provides no other services to the Company or our executive officers, and the Committee has the right to terminate the services of Meridian and appoint a new compensation consultant at any time. Meridian interacts with several of our officers and employees as necessary.  In addition, Meridian may seek input and feedback from members of our management regarding its work product prior to presentation to the Committee to confirm that information is accurate or address other issues.  We believe that Meridian provides an independent perspective to the Committee. The CEO’s Role The Committee seeks significant input from the CEO on compensation decisions and performance appraisals for all executive officers other than himself.  All final compensation decisions for our executive officers are made by the Committee, except that the independent members of our full Board determine and approve the CEO’s target compensation.  The CEO does not provide recommendations or participate in Committee or Board discussions concerning his own compensation. 33     MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Peer Groups Peer group benchmarking is one of several factors the Committee considers in setting pay and is reviewed at least annually by the Committee.  The Committee utilizes two peer groups as part of the broader compensation framework.  One peer group is used to benchmark targeted compensation levels for our executives (compensation peer group), and a second peer group is used to measure relative Company performance in our LTI program (performance peer group).  The performance peer group (excluding the S&P 500 Energy Index and the S&P 500 Index) is also used to determine stretch performance for certain metrics in our annual cash bonus program by measuring Company performance versus peer performance (to the extent public data is available). Our compensation peer group is comprised of independent E&P companies of similar market capitalization and enterprise value that the Committee believes provide the best external benchmarks for the market in which we compete for executive talent.  Pertinent financial measures considered in determining the compensation peer group are enterprise value, market capitalization, assets and revenue.  Our performance peer group includes broader market comparisons with a focus on independent E&P companies with which we compete for investor capital. The following compensation peer group was used in establishing 2023 pay levels for our executives: 2023 Compensation Peer Group APA Corporation EQT Corporation Chesapeake Energy Corporation Hess Corporation Coterra Energy Inc. Murphy Oil Corporation Continental Resources, Inc. Ovintiv Inc. Devon Energy Corporation PDC Energy, Inc. Diamondback Energy, Inc. See “Long-Term Incentives” for the 2023 performance peer group for LTI awards. Both compensation and performance peer groups are assessed and updated as appropriate on an annual basis and in consultation with the Committee’s independent compensation consultant. Compensation Benchmarking Process The Committee conducts an annual comparison of the compensation of our NEOs to the compensation of executives with similar job responsibilities among companies in our compensation peer group, based upon information gathered and provided by Meridian through surveys and public company disclosure.  The Committee references this competitive market analysis in making compensation decisions for the coming year. The Committee has typically aligned executive total direct compensation opportunities within a competitive market range of similar opportunities across the compensation peer group, adjusted for internal parity and individual factors across executives.  We define total direct compensation as the sum of base salary, target annual cash bonus and the target grant value of LTI awards. In October 2022, Meridian provided the Committee a market analysis that included information regarding compensation peer group executives’ base salaries, target annual bonus levels and the mix and level of long-term incentives.  According to this analysis, competitiveness of Marathon Oil’s 2023 NEO compensation levels and long-term incentive values varied by individual, but generally were positioned at the lower end of the competitive market range. MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     34 2023 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM ELEMENTS Our executive compensation program includes base salary, annual cash bonuses, LTI awards and other benefits and perquisites.  By design, a significant portion of our executive officers’ overall compensation, including annual cash bonuses and LTI awards, is “performance-based,” and the opportunity to earn those awards is largely dependent on Company and individual performance. To further emphasize the importance of performance, in 2023, the Committee increased the total performance unit weighting from 50% to 60% of LTI awards for our NEOs. The Committee determines a total compensation opportunity for each executive officer based on a review of compensation benchmarks from independent E&P companies, broader oil and gas companies and general industry, a review of our compensation philosophy and the Committee’s subjective judgment.  Because the Committee does not set fixed percentages for each element of compensation, the mix may change over time as the competitive market moves, governance standards evolve or our business needs change. 89% of CEO’s total target direct compensation influenced by Company performance Eighty-nine percent of our CEO’s 2023 total target direct compensation is influenced by the Company’s performance.  The allocation of our compensation components, with a significant emphasis on LTI awards, aligns with the practices of our compensation peer group with reference to the broader industry.  The following pie charts reflect the 2023 pay mix of total target direct compensation components for our CEO and other NEOs, respectively. 2023 TOTAL TARGET DIRECT COMPENSATION OVERVIEW The Committee determined 2023 base salaries, target annual cash bonus opportunities and LTI awards in February 2023 and determined the payment of 2023 annual cash bonuses in January 2024, after 2023 business results were known and reviewed by internal audit. To position NEO compensation levels closer to the 50th percentile of the compensation peer group, the Committee determined that all NEOs except Mr. Tillman would receive an increase in base salary and that all NEOs including Mr. Tillman would receive an increase in target LTI grant values.  The following table summarizes the elements of total direct compensation the Committee awarded to our NEOs for 2023 as part of our regular compensation program.  The amounts shown include the target opportunity for short-term incentives and target grant value for long-term compensation.  These numbers differ from those shown in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. Target LTI values reflect established compensation valuation methodologies that are similar to, but differ from, the methodologies used for accounting purposes as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.  Target bonus opportunity does not reflect actual performance results. 35     MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Name 2023 Base Salary (1) Target Bonus Opportunity LTI Award Target Value Total Target Compensation Mr. Tillman $1,200,000 $1,800,000 $8,000,000 $11,000,000 Mr. Whitehead $620,000 $558,000 $2,500,000 $3,678,000 Mr. Wagner $520,000 $468,000 $2,000,000 $2,988,000 Mr. Henderson $500,000 $450,000 $2,050,000 $3,000,000 Ms. Warnica $475,000 $427,500 $1,750,000 $2,652,500 (1) 2023 Base Salary reflects salaries approved by the Committee in February 2023, effective March 1, 2023. BASE SALARY The primary purpose of base salary is to recognize and reward overall responsibilities, experience and established skills.  In setting base salary, the Committee compares each NEO’s current salary to the competitive market ranges of E&P peers and broader general industry companies and considers each individual’s experience and expertise, the value and responsibility associated with the role and internal pay equity.  The Committee does not use a formula to calculate base salary increases for NEOs. In February 2023, the Committee reviewed base salaries and the considerations noted above.  The Committee determined to make base salary increases for all NEOs, except for Mr. Tillman, as shown below, to bring total direct compensation levels closer to the 50th percentile of the compensation peer group. Name Base Salary as of January 1, 2023 Base Salary as of December 31, 2023 Mr. Tillman $1,200,000 $1,200,000 Mr. Whitehead $590,000 $620,000 Mr. Wagner $500,000 $520,000 Mr. Henderson $475,000 $500,000 Ms. Warnica $450,000 $475,000 ANNUAL CASH BONUS The Company maintains an annual cash bonus program that rewards executives for the Company’s achievement of short-term safety, environmental, financial and operational goals that bring an immediate focus on items that should positively impact long-term sustainability and stockholder value, as well as for their individual performance during the year.  At the beginning of the year, the Committee determines a fixed target bonus opportunity for each executive, based on an observed range of market practices, as well as each executive’s experience, relative scope of responsibility, internal pay equity considerations and any other information the Committee deems relevant in its discretion.  The executive can earn from 0% to 200% of the target bonus opportunity based on the Company’s performance against a scorecard of quantitative business metrics and qualitative objectives, as well as the individual’s performance.  The Company also uses this same scorecard to determine bonus funding for other eligible employees across the Company.  The scorecard conveys to employees the Company’s top priorities and collective business objectives for the entire organization. MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     36 The Committee determined the 2023 annual cash bonus payout for each NEO based on its assessment of the following: » Quantitative Company performance metrics, weighted at 80%; » Qualitative Company performance objectives, weighted at 20%; and » Individual performance, including achievement of pre-established goals, leadership and ethics and overall value that the officer created for the Company. OFFICER BONUS FRAMEWORK [ Eligible Earnings x Bonus Target (as % of Base Salary) = Target Bonus Opportunity ] x Company Performance Score 80% Quantitative Performance 20% Qualitative Performance x Individual Performance Adjustment = Annual Bonus Payout 2023 Quantitative Performance Metrics During the first quarter of 2023, the Committee established quantitative performance metrics for the bonus program, which collectively represent 80% of the total bonus award opportunity.  Except for a 5% reduction to the Capital Discipline/FCF weighting and a 5% increase to the Financial Returns/Balance Sheet weighting, the Committee made no changes to these quantitative metrics from 2022, maintaining a focus on safety, the importance of measurable ESG metrics and financial leadership through differentiated capital efficiency, maintaining capital discipline and sustainable growth in cash flow per debt adjusted share. Selected financial performance metrics are fully consistent with the Company’s objective to deliver strong corporate returns and sustainable free cash flow. Quantitative Performance Metrics Overview Key Focus Area Compensation Metric Safety Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) ESG Excellence GHG Emissions Intensity Capital Efficiency / FCF Corporate FCF Breakeven Capital Discipline / FCF Reinvestment Rate Financial Returns / Balance Sheet Cash Flow per Debt Adjusted Share The Committee determined the target level of performance for each metric by evaluating and considering multiple factors, such as performance achieved in the immediately preceding year, anticipated challenges for 2023, differentiated top tier performance based on relative strength of the 2023 Company business plan to performance peers based on consensus estimates, the operational and macroeconomic environment in which we operate and Company strategy.  The Company set aggressive, competitive threshold, target and stretch goals to challenge our employees and drive stockholder value throughout the year.  For the three quantitative financial metrics of enterprise breakeven, reinvestment rate and cash flow per debt adjusted share, consistent with the methodology used for 2022, target was set for 2023 based on the Company’s 2023 business plan at the 30-day monthly average strip pricing for the period beginning on December 12, 2022.  The stretch goals for enterprise breakeven and reinvestment rate were also set to be the best of our performance peers.   Stretch for 37     MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS cash flow per debt adjusted share was set based on the Company’s 2023 business plan at $90 WTI pricing.  The following table shows the methodology for setting the 2023 target and stretch goals for each quantitative metric. Compensation Metric Target Set Based On: Stretch Set Based On: TRIR 10% improvement over three-year TRIR average Set at 10% improvement on the best in Company history GHG Emissions Intensity Company’s 2023 business plan Top quartile of performance peers Enterprise Breakeven & Reinvestment Rate Company’s 2023 business plan at 30-day monthly average strip pricing for period beginning December 12, 2022 Best of performance peers Cash Flow per Debt Adjusted Share Company’s 2023 business plan at 30-day monthly average strip pricing for period beginning December 12, 2022 Company’s 2023 business plan at $90 WTI pricing In early 2024, the Committee evaluated the Company’s 2023 performance against the quantitative metrics established early in 2023.  The Company delivered record safety results, as measured by TRIR, with results better than the stretch goal.  GHG emissions intensity results were better than the 2023 target, demonstrating strong environmental performance and achieving our 2025 goal for GHG intensity reduction two years ahead of plan.  The Company achieved impressive operational and financial results during 2023.  These achievements led to best in performance peer results for the quantitative financial metrics of enterprise breakeven and reinvestment rate.  However, because the threshold and target goals were aggressive for these metrics given the commodity pricing assumed when the scorecard was initially established, the quantitative scorecard achievement was below threshold for enterprise breakeven and between threshold and target for reinvestment rate, notwithstanding the Company’s simultaneous achievement of the best in performance peer stretch goal for these metrics.  An aggressive goal was also set for cash flow per debt adjusted share.  Though the Company returned 41% of adjusted CFO to its stockholders, better than its minimum commitment of 40% of adjusted CFO, with the resulting distribution yield the best among its performance peers, the Company’s cash flow per debt adjusted share achievement was between threshold and target. The following table shows the targets and weightings established for 2023 by the Committee and the performance achievement approved by the Committee in early 2024 (Performance Achieved) for each quantitative performance metric. MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     38 Key Focus Area Weight (% of Quantitative Component) Performance Measure Target Performance Achieved Result as % of Target Weighted Payout Safety 15 TRIR (1) 0.25 0.21 200% 30% ESG Excellence 10 GHG Emissions Intensity (2) 15.8 14.4 121% 12% Capital Efficiency / FCF 25 Enterprise Breakeven (3)(6) $39 $46              (best in performance peers) —% —% Capital Discipline / FCF 20 Reinvestment Rate (4)(6) 42% 49%             (best in performance peers) 88% 18% Financial Returns / Balance Sheet 30 Cash Flow per Debt Adjusted Share (5)(6) $6.02 $5.49 92% 27% Total Payout of 80% Quantitative Bonus Opportunity 87% Weighted Payout of 80% Quantitative Bonus Opportunity 70% (1)  Calculated by dividing (a) the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable incidents multiplied by 200,000 by (b) the total number of exposure hours.  This metric includes both Company employees and contractors and is applied to Company operated properties only. (2)  Total GHG emissions intensity excluding acquisitions and dispositions.  GHG emissions intensity is defined as tonnes of CO 2 e on a weighted basis divided by production (mboe). (3)  Enterprise breakeven is the minimum WTI pricing needed to have free cash flow before dividend equal to zero.  Other product pricings are held at strip pricing. (4)  Reinvestment rate is a non-GAAP measure for which a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure is included in Annex A.  Reinvestment rate is calculated by dividing capital spend (defined as development capital plus resources capture spend) by operating cash flow before working capital. (5) Cash flow per debt adjusted share is calculated by dividing cash flow (defined as operating cash flow before working capital plus net interest after tax) by total shares including debt shares (debt shares are the average net debt during a calendar year divided by the average stock price, or simply equitizing debt).  Cash flow per debt adjusted share is a non-GAAP measure for which there is no GAAP equivalent. (6) Target is based off the 2023 business plan at the 30-day monthly average strip pricing (December 12th through January 13th) - 2023 WTI: $76.14, Mt. Belvieu: $24.39, HH: $4.51, TTF: $29.74.  Cash flow per share target utilizes the same 30-day average stock price (December 12th through January 13th) of $26.98 to calculate debt shares. 2023 Qualitative Objectives After assessing the Company’s quantitative performance metrics, the Committee evaluated qualitative objectives, representing 20% of the total bonus award opportunity.  The Committee evaluated objectives and achievements not considered by the quantitative metrics, such as ESG commitments and other prevailing business priorities.  The Committee considered, among other things, the following Company achievements and execution of progressive business actions during 2023: » Generated approximately $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow. » Returned 41% of adjusted CFO to stockholders in 2023. » Distributed $1.7 billion to stockholders. » Executed $1.5 billion of share repurchases, driving a 9% reduction to our outstanding shares of common stock. 39     MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS » Increased our per share base dividend 22% from the year-end 2022 level, with no impact on our peer-leading post dividend free cash flow breakeven. » Reduced gross debt by $500 million, further strengthening our investment grade balance sheet. » Successfully integrated Ensign into the Eagle Ford asset team. » Delivered impressive commercial achievements in E.G., including signing an HOA with the Republic of E.G. and our partner to progress the development of the E.G. Regional Gas Mega Hub.  In addition, we entered into a five-year firm LNG sales agreement indexed to global LNG pricing (in contrast to the legacy Henry Hub linked contract) for a portion of our equity natural gas produced from Alba Field (Alba Unit, MRO 64% working interest), effective January 1, 2024, which is expected to drive significant improvement in 2024 financial performance for our E.G. Integrated Gas Business. » Achieved full year 2023 oil and oil-equivalent production of 190,000 net bopd and 405,000 net boed. » Improved our gas capture rate to 99.5%. » Strategically invested to build healthier, safer, more resilient and stronger local communities. The successful achievement of these qualitative objectives, along with the achievement of performance peer-leading results in enterprise breakeven and reinvestment rate, produced an impressive year that delivered strong financial outcomes and drove differentiated execution. Upon review of these achievements, the Committee concluded that the Company had achieved maximum overall qualitative performance, resulting in a 40% weighted payout score for the qualitative bonus opportunity. 2023 Combined Company Performance Factor Component Weight (%) Weighted Payout (% of target) Quantitative 80 70 Qualitative 20 40 Weighted Company Performance Factor 110 2023 Individual Performance The Committee maintains discretion to adjust individual cash bonuses to recognize critical performance factors and accomplishments that may not have been fully considered in the performance score calculation. An individual performance adjustment of 115% was applied for Mr. Wagner based on his key contributions to the successful Ensign acquisition and subsequent integration and the successful marketing of a large portion of our equity LNG from Equatorial Guinea under a new five-year sales agreement.  The Ensign acquisition added significant high return, high working interest inventory to our core Eagle Ford position that was accretive to the Company’s overall inventory life.  The pricing structure for the LNG sales agreement is linked to global LNG pricing and offers significant value uplift relative to the legacy Henry Hub linked contract, further strengthening our integrated gas business in Equatorial Guinea and positioning the Company for the next phase of opportunities to advance the E.G. Regional Gas Mega Hub. MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     40 Annual Cash Bonus Payouts Earned for 2023 Taking into consideration the Company’s quantitative and qualitative performance, the Committee determined actual bonus payments earned for 2023 performance, as shown below.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES Long-term incentive, or LTI, awards align the interests of NEOs and stockholders over the long term and are intended to represent the largest portion of the NEO’s total direct compensation.  LTI is designed to incentivize executives to achieve strategic goals that will maximize long-term stockholder value and encourage retention through continued service requirements.  These awards assist NEOs in establishing and maintaining significant equity ownership and place a meaningful portion of compensation at risk based on our common stock price performance.  The Committee increased the total performance unit award weighting from 50% to 60% in 2023 and believes this allocation spreads performance risk and eliminates overreliance on a single performance metric.  The 2023 LTI program consists of three vehicles, all denominated in shares of our common stock, including: » Free cash flow based performance unit awards (FCF PSUs) , which comprise 30% of the award mix; » Relative TSR based performance unit awards (TSR PSUs) , which comprise 30% of the award mix; and » Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) , which comprise 40% of the award mix. The Committee awards LTI based on a target award value that reflects competitive market data, each NEO’s performance and each NEO’s target total compensation.  LTI awards are currently granted under the Marathon Oil Corporation 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan, or 2019 ICP, which is the Company’s omnibus, stockholder- approved incentive compensation plan. Each year, the Committee approves target award values at its regularly scheduled February meeting.  The grant date is aligned with the grant date for awards to other eligible employees, which is typically March 1 of each year.  The actual LTI compensation realized by each NEO generally depends on the price of the underlying shares of common stock at the time of vesting and, in the case of performance units, our performance relative to the respective performance metric (TSR relative to that of our performance peer group for the TSR PSUs, which includes industry peers and two indices as described further below, and our generation of free cash flow for the FCF PSUs as described further below). 2023 Long-Term Incentive Awards Based on the factors described above, the Committee awarded LTI with a grant date of March 1, 2023, to each NEO.  The table below lists the target grant LTI value, reflecting the aggregate of FCF PSUs, TSR PSUs and RSUs, for each NEO.  Target LTI values reflect established compensation valuation methodologies that are similar to, but differ from, the methodologies used for accounting purposes as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.  Additional information about each LTI award, including the number of shares subject to each award, is shown in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. 41     MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Total 2023 LTI Awards Target Value Name Annual Target Mr. Tillman $8,000,000 Mr. Whitehead $2,500,000 Mr. Wagner $2,000,000 Mr. Henderson $2,050,000 Ms. Warnica $1,750,000 FCF Performance Units The FCF performance unit awards are designed to focus NEOs on generating sustainable free cash flow across a wide range of commodity prices, which enables the Company to support our objective of returning cash back to stockholders.  For purposes of these awards, free cash flow is calculated before dividends and is determined as follows:  net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for working capital, less capital expenditures and includes EG LNG return of capital and other.  It will be modified to exclude the impact, whether positive or negative, of any major acquisition or disposition, as determined by the Committee.  The Committee generally has sole and absolute discretion to reduce the final payment associated with any performance unit award as it may deem appropriate.  FCF performance units are denominated in shares and earned as set forth below and, if earned, will be paid in cash. 2023 FCF Performance Units In March 2023, the Committee awarded the NEOs FCF performance units that will vest based on cumulative free cash flow for the two-year performance period ending December 31, 2024.  The percentage of units that can be earned ranges from 0% to 200% of the units granted based on the payout table below, and subject to certain continued employment requirements. FCF Performance Targets (in millions) (1) % of Target PSUs Earned FCF ≥ $7,084 200% FCF of $5,153 100% FCF of $2,577 50% FCF of $386 20% FCF < $386 0% (1) FCF Performance Targets rounded to the closest million.  Payout percentages for free cash flow values between $386 million and $7,084 million to be determined using linear interpolation between 20% and 200% of target, with a target payout at a free cash flow of $5,153 million. During the performance period, if cumulative free cash flow of $2,577 million is achieved, based on a quarterly assessment, 50% of target units will have their value determined based on the average of the daily closing price of a share of our common stock during the final thirty calendar days ending on the last trading day of the quarter in which cumulative free cash flow of $2,577 million is achieved.  If cumulative free cash flow of $5,153 million is achieved during the performance period, based on a quarterly assessment, an additional 50% of target units (or 100% of target units if cumulative free cash flow of $2,577 million is achieved during the same quarter) will have their value determined based on the average of the daily closing price of a share of our common stock during the final thirty calendar days ending on the last trading day of the quarter in which cumulative free cash flow of $5,153 million is achieved. MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     42 At the end of the performance period, if cumulative free cash flow achieved during the performance period is less than $2,577 million, any earned units (i.e., less than 50% of target) will have their value determined based on the average of the daily closing price of a share of our common stock during the final thirty calendar days ending on the last trading day of the performance period.  If, at the end of the performance period, cumulative free cash flow achieved is greater than $5,153 million, any incremental units earned greater than target, up to a maximum of 200%, will have their value determined based on the average of the daily closing price of a share of our common stock during the final thirty calendar days ending on the last trading day of the performance period. After completion of the performance period, earned awards are paid in cash with the final cash value determined by the number of units granted multiplied by the vesting percentage, with vested units valued based on the valuation determination described above.  Dividend equivalents accrue and are paid in cash based on the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. 2022 FCF Performance Units For the FCF performance units granted in March 2022, with a performance period ending December 31, 2023, we achieved cumulative free cash flow of $6,128,882,000, which equated to a vesting percentage of 200%.  In accordance with the award terms at the time of grant, 50% of targeted units were valued at $24.81 per unit, an additional 50% of units were valued at $26.77 per unit and the final 100% of units were valued at $24.45 per unit.  In January 2024, the Committee determined the final payout values for each NEO, and the payouts (excluding the dividend equivalents also paid under the awards) were $3,292,227; $1,262,029; $823,032; $740,739; and $658,445 for each of Messrs. Tillman, Whitehead, Wagner and Henderson and Ms. Warnica, respectively. TSR Performance Units The Committee believes that a performance unit award based on TSR relative to the broader market and industry peer companies aligns pay and Company performance.  The performance peer group shown below includes the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 500 Energy Index and select industry peers.  TSR is determined by adding the sum of stock price appreciation or reduction per share, plus cumulative dividends per share for the performance period, and dividing that total by the beginning stock price per share.  For purposes of this calculation, the beginning and ending stock prices are the averages of the closing stock prices for the ninety calendar days immediately preceding the beginning and ending dates of the performance period.  The Committee generally has sole and absolute discretion to reduce the final payment associated with any performance unit award as it may deem appropriate.  TSR performance units, if earned, will be paid in shares of our common stock. 43     MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 2023 TSR Performance Units In March 2023, the Committee awarded the NEOs performance units that will vest based on TSR for the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2025, relative to the 2023 performance peer group. 2023 Performance Peer Group for LTI (1) APA Corporation Murphy Oil Corporation Chesapeake Energy Corporation Ovintiv Inc. Devon Energy Corporation S&P 500 Index Diamondback Energy, Inc. S&P 500 Energy Index EOG Resources, Inc. (1) Hess Corporation (Hess) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) have been removed from the 2023 performance peer group due to the announcements that these companies are being acquired by Chevron Corporation and ExxonMobil, respectively. The percentage of units that can be earned ranges from 0% to 200% of the units granted based on the payout table below.   Each NEO will receive vested shares of our common stock equal to the number of units granted multiplied by the payout percentage.  Dividend equivalents accrue and are paid in cash based on the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. MRO TSR Ranking % of Target PSUs Earned Ranked 1st or 2nd in performance peer group 200% Ranked 3rd through 7th in performance peer group Between 200% and 35% (1) Ranked 8th in performance peer group 35% Ranked 9th or 10th in performance peer group 0% (1)  Determined using linear interpolation. If there is an announcement during the performance period of an event that if completed would result in a peer group member either ceasing to exist or no longer being a company for which TSR can be calculated from publicly available information, then upon such announcement, that peer group member is removed from the performance peer group for LTI.  The payout percentages for the top two peers, third peer from the bottom and the bottom two peers maintain the vesting percentages of 200%, 35% and 0%, respectively, and the remaining peer group percentages will be determined using linear interpolation between 35% and 200% for the smaller performance peer group.  Since the time of the grant, the performance peer group has reduced from 12 to 10 peers (including the Company) due to the acquisition announcements of Hess and Pioneer, in accordance with the award agreement terms. 2022 TSR Performance Units The TSR performance units granted in March 2022 have a performance period end date of December 31, 2024.  These awards, if earned, are paid in shares of our common stock, except for accrued dividend equivalents, which are paid in cash.  The percentage of units that can be earned ranges from 0% to 200% of the units granted based on terms similar to those described above for the 2023 TSR performance units, as further detailed in the applicable award agreements. MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     44 2021 TSR Performance Units For the performance period ending December 31, 2023, we ranked 1 out of 9 peers.  Since the time of grant, due to merger and acquisition activity, Cimarex Energy Co. is no longer an existing company.  Continental Resources, Inc. completed a take-private transaction, and Hess and Pioneer have also announced that they will be acquired.  Therefore, these companies have been removed from the peer group for the applicable performance period in accordance with the award agreement terms.  The payout percentages for each ranking were recalibrated over the 9 peers. In January 2024, the Committee certified the final number of vested shares of common stock for each NEO for the performance period ending December 31, 2023.  The vested shares of common stock were 267,856; 83,704; 66,964; 53,570 and 44,642 for each of Messrs. Tillman, Whitehead, Wagner and Henderson and Ms. Warnica, respectively. Restricted Stock Units The Committee awards RSUs for diversification of the LTI award mix, for consistent alignment between executives and stockholders and for retention purposes.  RSUs provide recipients with the opportunity for capital accumulation, leading to retention and stock ownership and a more predictable long-term incentive value than is provided by performance units or stock options. RSUs awarded in 2023 generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year vesting period.  RSUs, if earned, will be paid in shares of our common stock.  Prior to vesting, recipients receive dividend equivalents on the RSUs and do not have voting rights during the vesting period. OTHER BENEFITS Perquisites We offer limited perquisites to our NEOs. We believe these perquisites are reasonable, particularly because the cost of these benefits constitutes a small percentage of each NEO’s total compensation. The Committee assesses these perquisites at least annually as part of its total competitive review of executive compensation.  We do not provide any tax gross-ups on these perquisites.  The perquisites available to our NEOs include reimbursement for certain tax, estate and financial planning services up to $15,000 per year in 2023, an enhanced annual physical examination and a Company-provided car service for our CEO.  Limited personal use of Company chartered aircraft is available to our NEOs.  Family members and guests may also accompany officers on business travel.  Any aggregate incremental cost to the Company resulting from the personal use of Company chartered aircraft would be included in the “All Other Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table.  Our NEOs also participate in the health, retirement and matching gift programs and other benefit plans generally available to our U.S. employees. See the “All Other Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table and the footnotes following the Summary Compensation Table for additional details concerning the perquisites provided to our NEOs in 2023. Retirement Benefits We offer our NEOs the opportunity to provide for retirement through four plans. » Marathon Oil Company Thrift Plan (Thrift Plan) – A tax-qualified 401(k) plan. » Retirement Plan of Marathon Oil Company (Retirement Plan) – A tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. » Excess Benefit Plan (Excess Plan) – A nonqualified plan allowing employees to accrue benefits above the tax limits, with components attributable to both the Thrift Plan and the Retirement Plan. 45     MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS » Marathon Oil Company Deferred Compensation Plan (Deferred Compensation Plan) – A nonqualified plan that grows when an NEO accrues benefits above the tax limits in the Thrift Plan or when an NEO defers a portion of his or her eligible compensation. The Thrift Plan and the Retirement Plan are broad-based plans that are open to all eligible employees of the Company.  Benefits payable under our qualified and nonqualified plans are described in more detail in “Post-Employment Benefits” and “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.” We also currently sponsor retiree health programs for a broad-based group of employees, including the NEOs hired before 2017, who also meet certain eligibility requirements.  As of March 25, 2024, Mr. Tillman and Mr. Henderson are the only NEOs who have met these eligibility requirements. Change in Control and Severance Benefits Our NEOs do not have employment agreements but are eligible for change in control termination benefits under the Marathon Oil Corporation Officer Change In Control Severance Plan (Change in Control Plan), as described under “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control.”  We believe these change in control benefits are necessary to attract and retain talent within our industry, ensure continuity of management in the event of a change in control and provide our NEOs with the security to make decisions that are in the best interests of stockholders. Our Board may exercise discretion to make severance payments to executives on a case-by-case basis. We have a policy requiring that our Board seek stockholder approval or ratification of certain severance agreements (not including the Change in Control Plan) for senior executive officers that would require payment of certain cash severance benefits exceeding 2.99 times the officer’s base salary plus the most recent annual cash bonus paid. STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS All our officers who are “executive officers” for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act are subject to our stock ownership requirements, which are intended to reinforce the alignment of interests between our officers and stockholders. EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS CEO’s actual stock ownership over 15 x base salary Position Multiple of Base Salary Chief Executive Officer 6 Executive Vice Presidents 4 Senior Vice Presidents 2 Vice Presidents 2 Executive officers have five years from their respective appointment or promotion dates to achieve the designated stock ownership level.  The Committee reviews each executive officer’s progress toward the requirements during the first quarter of each year to determine whether the market value of shares, including the value of unvested shares and RSUs, satisfies our requirements.  Stock options and performance units are not counted as shares owned in measuring stock ownership.  Executive officers who do not hold the required level of stock ownership must hold the shares they receive upon vesting of restricted stock, RSUs or exercise of stock options (after payment of exercise prices and after taxes) until they have met their requirement.  As of March 25, 2024, each NEO meets the requisite threshold.  To ensure that they bear the full risks of stock ownership, our officers, including our executive officers, are prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions related to our stock. MARATHON OIL | COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     46 TAX CONSIDERATIONS The Committee considers the tax effects to both the Company and the NEOs when making executive compensation decisions.  While the Committee endeavors to deliver compensation in a tax efficient manner, the Committee’s priority is to provide performance-based and competitive compensation.  Therefore, some compensation paid to NEOs is not deductible due to the limitations imposed by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits the deduction that we can take to $1 million per “covered employee” each year. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The following table summarizes the total compensation for each NEO for the years shown.

For 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Stock Awards column also includes the grant date fair value of the share-denominated performance units granted in March 2023, March 2022 and March 2021, respectively. TSR performance unit grants made in March 2023, March 2022 and March 2021 will be share settled and FCF performance unit grants made in March 2023, March 2022 and March 2021 will be settled in cash. The value ultimately realized by the officers upon the actual vesting of the awards may or may not be equal to this determined value, as these awards are subject to market conditions and have been valued based on an assessment of the market conditions as of the grant date. The maximum (200%) payouts for the 2023 performance units using the December 29, 2023 closing stock price of $24.16 would be: for Mr. Tillman, $8,993,222; for Mr. Whitehead, $2,810,388; for Mr. Wagner, $2,248,233; for Mr. Henderson, $2,304,477 and for Ms. Warnica, $1,967,204. See the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table” and “Long-Term Incentives” for further detail on our performance unit program.

Due to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act confidentiality requirements, we do not disclose actual use of this program by individual officers. (b)    This column reflects reimbursement for professional advice related to tax, estate and financial planning. The maximum annual benefit for 2023 is $15,000, and reimbursements are attributed to the calendar year in which services are performed. Due to processing delays, the actual amount reimbursed to an officer may exceed $15,000 in a given year. (c)    For Mr. Tillman, this column reflects access to a Company-provided car service based on cost to the Company.  This benefit is offered to Mr. Tillman to allow the efficient use of his time and to provide safe transportation given the demands of his role, including travel, after hours/weekend obligations and extended work hours.  We provide access to this benefit because we believe that the cost is outweighed by the convenience, increased safety and efficiency that it offers. This column would also reflect the aggregate incremental cost to the Company resulting from any permitted limited personal use of Company chartered aircraft by NEOs. However, no NEOs used Company chartered aircraft for this purpose in 2023.  In limited circumstances, family members were allowed to accompany officers on Company chartered aircraft for business travel.  However, this did not result in an aggregate incremental cost to the Company in 2023. (d)    This column reflects amounts contributed by us under the Thrift Plan and related non-qualified deferred compensation plans. See “Post-Employment Benefits” and “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation” for more information about the non-qualified plans.

POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Marathon Oil offers NEOs the opportunity to save for retirement as follows: » Marathon Oil Company Thrift Plan, or Thrift Plan: a tax-qualified 401(k) plan that currently provides for company matching contributions of up to 7% of eligible earnings. » Retirement Plan of Marathon Oil Company, or Retirement Plan: a tax qualified defined benefit pension plan. 51     MARATHON OIL | EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION » Marathon Oil Company Excess Benefit Plan, or Excess Plan: a nonqualified plan.  The defined benefit portion allows participants to accrue benefits above the defined benefit tax limits, and the defined contribution portion allows participants to accrue benefits above the defined contribution tax limits. » Marathon Oil Company Deferred Compensation Plan, or Deferred Compensation Plan: a nonqualified plan allowing participants to defer a portion of their compensation and accrue benefits above the Thrift Plan tax limits. All plans have a three-year vesting requirement for company contributions. All NEOs have met the vesting requirement. See “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation” below for additional information on the Deferred Compensation Plan and the defined contribution portion of the Excess Plan. Retirement Plan In general, all regular full-time and part-time employees in the United States are eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan as of their date of hire. Benefit accruals are determined under a cash-balance formula, under which plan participants receive pay credits each year equal to a percentage of eligible compensation based on their plan points.  Plan points equal the sum of a participant’s age and cash-balance service.  Participants with fewer than 50 points receive a 7% pay credit percentage; participants with 50 to 69 points receive a 9% pay credit percentage; and participants with 70 or more points receive an 11% pay credit percentage.  Participants are also credited with interest at a rate based on the 30-year Treasury rate with a 3.00% minimum, which in 2023 was 3.58%. For 2023, Messrs. Tillman and Henderson received pay credits equal to 11% of eligible compensation, and Messrs. Whitehead and Wagner and Ms. Warnica received pay credits equal to 9% of eligible compensation. Normal retirement age under the Retirement Plan is age 65.  Retirement Plan benefits include various annuity and installment options and a lump sum distribution option. We have not granted years of service in addition to the service recognized under the terms of our qualified retirement plans (applicable to a broad-based group of employees) to any NEO for purposes of retirement benefit accruals. Excess Plan - Defined Benefit Portion The Excess Plan for certain highly compensated employees, including our NEOs, provides benefits that participants would have received under our tax-qualified Retirement Plan but for certain Internal Revenue Code limitations.  Eligible compensation under the Excess Plan includes deferred compensation contributions made by NEOs.  The Excess Plan also provides an enhancement for officers based on the three highest bonuses earned during their last ten years of employment, instead of the consecutive bonus formula in place for non-officers.  Distributions under the Excess Plan are paid in a lump sum following separation from service. MARATHON OIL | EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION     52 Pension Benefits Table The following table shows the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits payable to each NEO under the Retirement Plan and the defined benefit portion of the Excess Plan as of December 31, 2023.

(2) Assuming a discount rate of 4.94%, a lump sum election rate of 100% for the nonqualified plan and 98% for the qualified plan, and retirement at age 62 or the age at measurement date, if older. NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION We offer certain employees, including our NEOs, the opportunity to accrue benefits equal to the Company matching contributions they would have received under the Thrift Plan but for certain Internal Revenue Code limitations.  Officers generally accrue these benefits in the Deferred Compensation Plan, while other employees accrue such benefits in the defined contribution portion of the Excess Plan.  Both plans have a three-year vesting requirement for company contributions.  All NEOs have met the vesting requirement.  Distributions from the Deferred Compensation Plan and the Excess Plan are paid as a lump sum following separation from service. Deferred Compensation Plan The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified plan into which a participant may elect to defer up to 20% of his or her eligible compensation each year.  Participants are fully vested in their own deferrals under the plan.  Additionally, participants can receive company contributions into the plan equal to the maximum potential matching contribution under the Thrift Plan after they have reached defined contribution accruals under the Thrift Plan in excess of tax limits. The investment options available under the Deferred Compensation Plan generally mirror the core investment options available under the Thrift Plan. 53     MARATHON OIL | EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Excess Plan - Defined Contribution Portion Prior to becoming eligible for participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan, NEOs may have received defined contribution accruals under the Excess Plan.  These contributions were available after a participant’s Thrift Plan contributions were limited due to tax requirements and equaled the matching contribution that participants would have received under the Thrift Plan but for limits imposed by tax law.  Defined contribution accruals in the Excess Plan are credited with interest equal to that paid in the “Managed Income Portfolio II” option of the Marathon Oil Company Thrift Plan.  The annual rate of return on this option for 2023 was 1.96%. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table The following table shows each NEO’s accumulated benefits under our Deferred Compensation Plan for 2023; the NEOs had no accumulated benefits under the defined contribution portion of our Excess Plan for 2023.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL As a matter of policy, we do not enter into employment, severance or change in control agreements with our NEOs. Rather, we provide a Marathon Oil Corporation Officer Change in Control Severance Benefits Plan (Change in Control Plan), which is described in more detail below. Retirement or Separation Upon retirement or separation, our NEOs are entitled to receive their vested benefits that have accrued under our broad-based and executive benefit programs.  For more information, see “Post-Employment Benefits” and “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.” Unvested outstanding equity awards generally forfeit upon a separation from service.  Certain of our outstanding equity awards include limited exceptions in connection with retirement.  Unvested RSU awards will continue to vest based on the original vesting date if a NEO is at least age 60 with five years of service upon separation from service and certain additional requirements are met.  Unvested performance units granted prior to 2022 are forfeited upon a separation from service unless a NEO is at least age 50 with ten years of service, has worked at least half of the performance period and meets certain other requirements, in which case awards may be vested on a prorated basis at the Committee’s discretion.  Unvested performance units granted in 2022 and MARATHON OIL | EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION     54 later are forfeited upon a separation from service unless a NEO is at least age 60 with five years of service, has worked at least half of the performance period and meets certain other requirements, in which case awards may be vested on a prorated basis at the Committee’s discretion. Death or Disability In the event of death or disability, our NEOs (or the beneficiary or estate, as defined by the plan terms) would be entitled to vested benefits accrued under our broad-based and executive benefits programs.  LTI awards would immediately vest in full upon the death of an NEO, with performance units vesting at the target level.  In the event of disability, performance unit awards would generally continue to vest as if the NEO remained actively employed during the period of disability (meaning the NEO has been determined to be disabled under the Company’s long-term disability plan or can provide proof of a Social Security determination of disability).  However, for RSUs, upon termination of employment not for cause while during a period of disability, the awards will immediately vest in full. Change in Control To encourage our NEOs to continue their dedication to their assigned duties where a change in control of the Company is under consideration, our Change in Control Plan provides severance benefits if employment is terminated under certain circumstances either within two years following a change in control or prior to a change in control if the NEO reasonably demonstrates that such termination of employment was at the request of actions by a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a change in control. Under the Change in Control Plan, a change in control generally will have occurred if: » Any person not affiliated with Marathon Oil acquires 20% or more of the voting power of our outstanding securities; » Our Board no longer has a majority comprised of (1) individuals who were directors on the effective date of the plan and (2) new directors (other than directors who join our Board in connection with an election contest) approved by two-thirds of the directors then in office who (a) were directors on the effective date of the plan or (b) were themselves previously approved by our Board in this manner; » We merge with another company and, as a result, our stockholders hold less than 50% of the surviving entity’s voting power immediately after the transaction; » Our stockholders approve a plan of complete liquidation of Marathon Oil; or » We sell all or substantially all of our assets. If an NEO was terminated without cause or resigned for good reason within two years following a change in control (or prior to a change in control if the NEO reasonably demonstrates that such termination of employment was at the request of actions by a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a change in control), he or she would be entitled to the following, payable in a lump sum: » a cash payment of up to three times the sum of (1) the NEO’s base salary (as in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of the circumstances giving rise to the termination from employment or, if higher, immediately prior to the change in control) and (2) the greater of (a) the NEO’s annual bonus at target for the year in which the termination from employment occurs or (b) the highest of the annual bonuses paid to the NEO for each of the three years before the termination from employment or, if higher, for each of the three years before the change in control; » a cash payment equal to the NEO’s annual bonus at target level multiplied by a fraction equal to the number of days in the bonus calculation year during which the NEO was employed divided by 365; and » a cash payment equal to eighteen times the monthly COBRA premium in effect at the NEO’s termination from employment for the level of coverage in which the NEO participated immediately prior to his or her termination from employment. 55     MARATHON OIL | EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION These benefits are not payable if the termination is for cause (as defined in the Change in Control Plan) or due to mandatory retirement, death, disability or resignation (other than for good reason, as defined in the Change in Control Plan) by the NEO. The program includes no provisions to reimburse or “gross up” tax obligations following a change in control. If a change in control occurs prior to the end of a performance period, unvested performance units will generally vest at the greater of target performance or the applicable vesting percentage based on actual performance for a performance period ending on the last regular trading day immediately prior to the date of the change in control. Accelerated vesting of unvested RSUs granted will occur generally only if an NEO is involuntarily terminated or terminates for good reason within the two years following a change in control. The Change in Control Plan will continue in effect for at least two years after a change in control. The following tables assume a termination date or change in control date of December 29, 2023, the last business day of 2023, based on Change in Control Plan terms in effect as of that date.  The value of the equity awards (accelerated vesting of RSU and performance unit awards) was calculated using the December 29, 2023, closing market price for our common stock of $24.16 and based on a performance period ending December 31, 2023.  The value of performance unit awards assumes that the 2021 TSR performance units would vest and be paid out at 200%, the 2022 TSR performance units and FCF performance units would vest and both be paid out at 200% and the 2023 TSR performance units and FCF performance units would vest and both be paid out at 100%.

(b)  For each covered fiscal year, these columns represent the additions to the Summary Compensation Table Total of: (bi) the fair value of equity calculated in accordance with the SEC methodology for determining “compensation actually paid” and (bii) Total Pension Benefit Adjustment, which represents service cost, as defined under FASB ASC 715 as the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to services rendered by an officer during the covered year; there were no prior service cost amounts established during the covered fiscal years. Note that the amounts reflected for the “Other NEOs” is an average.  For each covered fiscal year, there were no equity awards that were granted and vested in the same year, and there were no equity awards that failed to meet vesting conditions in the year.  Additionally, the methodology for the valuation assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the equity awards is the same as that used to determine the aggregate grant date fair values disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table, though with adjustments for the applicable time period.  We do not view these adjustments as material differences in the assumptions.  As disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table, the assumptions used to calculate the aggregate grant date fair values reflected in that table are included in footnotes to our consolidated financial statements in our annual reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. (3) The peer group used for this pay versus performance disclosure is the same as the peer group used for purposes of Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K (the 201(e) peer group or peer group) as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the 2023 fiscal year as of the end of such fiscal year.  As of December 31, 2023, the members of the 201(e) peer group included:  Apache Corporation (APA), Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK), Devon Energy Corporation (DVN), Diamondback Energy, Inc. (FANG), EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG), Murphy Oil Corporation (MUR) and Ovintiv Inc. (OVV).  As of December 31, 2022, the members of the 201(e) peer group included:  APA, DVN, FANG, EOG, Hess Corporation (HES), MUR, OVV, and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD).  In setting the 2023 201(e) peer group, CHK was added to keep the peer group a comparable size to prior years.  Additionally, CHK is only included in the calculation beginning with its emergence from bankruptcy in February 2021.  Based on application of pre-established, objective criteria, HES and PXD were removed from the 201(e) peer group during 2023 as a result of the announcements that HES is being acquired by Chevron Corporation and PXD is being acquired by ExxonMobil, respectively.  The peer group TSR determined using the 2022 201(e) peer group but without HES and PXD (as those companies were removed from the 2023 peer group based on application of pre-established, objective criteria) for each of 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 is $59MM, $124MM, $198MM and $181MM, respectively. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES The most important financial performance measures used by the Company to link executive compensation actually paid to the Company’s NEOs, for the most recently completed fiscal year, to the Company’s performance are as follows: MOST IMPORTANT FINANCIAL MEASURES » Cash Flow per Debt Adjusted Share » Enterprise Breakeven » Reinvestment Rate » Cumulative Free Cash Flow » Relative TSR (the Company’s TSR as compared to a performance peer group established by the Compensation Committee for the TSR PSUs) For 2023, the performance measures listed were identified as the most important financial measures in the compensation-setting process for the NEOs.  The importance of cash flow per debt adjusted share, enterprise breakeven and reinvestment rate is reflected by our use of these measures when setting performance standards applicable to our 2023 annual cash bonus program.  See “Annual Cash Bonus” in the “Compensation Discussion MARATHON OIL | PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE     58 and Analysis”.  Cumulative free cash flow and relative TSR are utilized in our 2023 LTI performance goals for FCF PSUs and TSR PSUs, respectively.  See “Long-Term Incentives” in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis.”  Though the Company uses a number of financial and non-financial performance measures in its executive compensation program, the Company has determined that, in its assessment, cash flow per debt adjusted share represents the most important financial performance measure (not otherwise required to be disclosed in the pay versus performance table) used by the Company to link “compensation actually paid” (CAP) to the Company’s NEOs to Company performance for the 2023 fiscal year. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THE PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE TABLE Compensation Actually Paid versus Cumulative Company TSR, Net Income and Cash Flow Per Debt Adjusted Share The below three charts demonstrate that CAP to the NEOs generally aligns with trends in the Company’s cumulative TSR, net income and cash flow per debt adjusted share over the four-year period presented in the charts. In 2020, the CAP to our PEO and the average CAP to our other NEOs was negative primarily due to the change in value of prior equity award grants that resulted from our stock price depreciation in 2020.  The global pandemic and unprecedented market dynamics in 2020 caused a significant decrease in stock prices at Marathon Oil and in the broader oil and gas industry during that year.  However, the CAP amounts over the 2020 through 2023 period increased and decreased in alignment with increases and decreases, respectively, in the three measures over the period. CAP vs Company Cumulative TSR 59     MARATHON OIL | PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE CAP vs Company Net Income CAP vs Company Cash Flow per Debt Adjusted Share MARATHON OIL | PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE     60 Company Cumulative TSR versus Peer Group Cumulative TSR As demonstrated by the following chart, the Company’s cumulative TSR over the 2020 through 2023 period generally aligns with the cumulative TSR of our peer group (as used for purposes of this pay versus performance disclosure) over the same period.  Our cumulative TSR was modestly lower than the cumulative TSR of our peer group in 2020.  However, 2020 was an unprecedented year, in which a combination of decreased global energy demand due to pandemic conditions and an oversupplied commodity market, resulted in severe market conditions. Company Cumulative TSR vs Peer Group Cumulative TSR 61     MARATHON OIL | PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE CEO PAY RATIO We are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Tillman, our CEO.  The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner that is consistent with applicable law, regulatory and other guidance. PAY RATIO For our last completed fiscal year, the annual total compensation for our median employee w as $126,589. The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, was $12,830,222 .  Thus, we estimate that our CEO’s compensation was 101 times the median of the annual total compensation for all of our employees. METHODOLOGY USED TO IDENTIFY MEDIAN EMPLOYEE To identify the annual total compensation for all our employees for purposes of identifying our median employee, we selected October 1, 2023, as our measurement date to allow sufficient time to gather data from the two main payroll systems we use, which are located in the United States and Equatorial Guinea. The majority of our employees are on our United States payroll, and the compensation used for employees on the United States payroll is compensation that would be reflected in Box 5 of Form W-2 for the period from January 1, 2023, to September 30, 2023. The compensation used for employees on the Equatorial Guinea payroll reflects pay from December 16, 2022, through September 15, 2023, and includes basic pay, absence pay, overtime amounts, offshore premiums and shift differential payments, as well as annual cash bonus amounts paid in March 2023, and bonus amounts paid in October 2023.  These October bonus amounts were included because they reflect work done prior to October 1, 2023, and their inclusion provides Equatorial Guinea payroll information that is more consistent with the measures used for the United States payroll. These measures of compensation were selected based on our view that each measure provides a reasonable estimate of the comprehensive compensation payments to our employees on each of the relevant payrolls.  Taken in the aggregate, we believe this data provides a reasonable estimate of the annual total compensation of all employees of Marathon Oil and its consolidated subsidiaries. As of October 1, 2023, our total employee population consisted of 1,690 employees working at Marathon Oil and its consolidated subsidiaries, which includes all full-time, part-time and seasonal or temporary employees. Of this total, 1,291 were United States payroll employees, which includes our United States payroll expatriate employees, and 399 were Equatorial Guinea payroll employees. Using this methodology, we determined that our median employee was a salaried, full-time employee working in the United States. MARATHON OIL | CEO PAY RATIO     62 TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS We have written procedures for monitoring, reviewing, approving or ratifying related person transactions.  We will enter into or ratify related person transactions only when our Board, acting through the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, determines that the related person transaction is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.  The primary features of these procedures are: » Each director and executive officer must submit a list of his or her immediate family members, each listed individual’s employer and job title, each firm, corporation or other entity in which such individual is a director, executive officer, partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a five percent or greater beneficial ownership interest, and any profit, non-profit charitable or trade organization for which such individual is actively involved in fundraising or otherwise serves as a director, trustee or in a similar capacity. » The Company maintains a list, to the extent the information is publicly available, of five percent beneficial owners and certain information regarding such five percent beneficial owners, including if the owner is an individual, the same information requested of directors and executive officers as noted above. » Any related person proposed transaction that involves an amount in excess of $120,000 is submitted to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or the Board at the next regularly scheduled meeting or, in certain cases, to the Committee Chair or other uninterested member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee delegated authority to act on such matters.  The facts and circumstances of each proposed related person transaction are reviewed and considered, and a determination is made regarding whether to approve it. » Additionally, the Company’s accounts payable, accounts receivable and payroll departments produce quarterly reports of any amounts paid or payable to, or received or receivable from, any related person identified in the lists mentioned above, which are reviewed internally to determine if there are any related person transactions that were not previously approved or ratified.  If any such transaction is identified based on this review, it is promptly submitted to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, Committee Chair or other member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, as appropriate, which reviews the transaction and considers all of the relevant facts and circumstances and a determination is made regarding ratification, modification or termination of the identified transaction.  If any such transaction is identified, Internal Audit will perform an evaluation of the Company’s controls and procedures. » The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee annually reviews any previously approved or ratified related person transaction with a remaining term of more than six months or remaining amounts payable to or receivable from the Company of more than $120,000.  Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, taking into consideration the Company’s contractual obligations, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee determines whether it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to continue, modify or terminate the transaction. During 2023, there were no transactions in excess of $120,000 between the Company and a related person in which the related person had a direct or indirect material interest. 63     MARATHON OIL | TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT The Audit and Finance Committee’s purpose is to assist our Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to, among other things: » the integrity of the Company’s financial statements and financial reporting process and the Company’s systems of internal accounting and financial controls; » the engagement of the independent auditor and the evaluation of the independent auditor’s qualifications, independence and performance; » the performance of the internal audit function; » the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and » the Company’s risk management process. The Audit and Finance Committee is comprised of four directors, each of whom has been determined by our Board to be independent and financially literate under the NYSE’s requirements.  The Audit and Finance Committee’s responsibilities are set forth in its charter, available on our website at www.marathonoil.com under About—Board of Directors—Committees and Charters. Management has primary responsibility for preparing our financial statements and establishing and maintaining our internal control over financial reporting.  The Company’s independent auditor is responsible for auditing our financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and issuing its reports based on those audits.  The Audit and Finance Committee oversees these processes. In connection with the evaluation, appointment and retention of the independent registered public accountants, the Audit and Finance Committee annually reviews the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent auditor and lead engagement partner and assures the regular rotation of the lead engagement partner as required.  In doing so, the Audit and Finance Committee considers a number of factors including, but not limited to: quality of services provided; technical expertise and knowledge of the industry; effective communication; objectivity; and independence.  Based on this evaluation, the Audit and Finance Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the Company’s financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for 2024.  In conjunction with the mandated rotation of the lead audit partner, the Audit and Finance Committee and its chairperson are directly involved in the selection of PwC’s lead engagement partner. The current lead engagement partner was selected in 2021, effective for 2022. We are seeking our stockholders’ ratification of the appointment of PwC to audit the Company’s financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for 2024 at the Annual Meeting.  The Audit and Finance Committee and our Board believe the appointment of PwC as our independent auditor for 2024 is in the Company’s best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders. The Audit and Finance Committee reviews and pre-approves the fees and expenses of the independent auditor for audit, audit-related, tax and permissible non-audit services. See “Proposal 2: Ratification of Independent Auditor for 2024” for more information on our pre-approval policy. In connection with the preparation of the Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the report on internal control over financial reporting for 2023: » The Audit and Finance Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Company’s audited financial statements and its report on internal control over financial reporting for 2023. » The Audit and Finance Committee met throughout the year with management and PwC, and met with PwC each quarter without the presence of management.  The Audit and Finance Committee discussed MARATHON OIL | AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT     64 with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB and the SEC. » The Audit and Finance Committee received written communication from PwC, including those related to independence, required by the PCAOB for independent auditor communications with audit committees, and has discussed with PwC that firm’s independence.  The Audit and Finance Committee has also considered whether PwC’s provision of non-audit services to the Company was compatible with maintaining such independence. Based on this review and discussion, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to our Board that the Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the report on internal control over financial reporting be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2023 filed with the SEC. AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE Holli C. Ladhani, Chair M. Elise Hyland Brent J. Smolik Shawn D. Williams 65     MARATHON OIL | AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT PROPOSAL 2:  RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR FOR 2024 The Audit and Finance Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the Company’s financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for 2024.  While the Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for appointing, approving compensation for and overseeing the independent auditor’s work, we are requesting, as a matter of good corporate governance, that our stockholders ratify the appointment of PwC as our independent auditor for 2024.  PwC served as the Company’s independent auditor during 2023.  We believe the appointment of PwC as our independent auditor for 2024 is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. We expect representatives of PwC to be present at the Annual Meeting with an opportunity to make a statement if they would like to do so and to be available to respond to appropriate questions from our stockholders. YOUR BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 2 RATIFYING THE SELECTION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANY’S INDEPENDENT AUDITOR FOR 2024. If our stockholders do not ratify this appointment, the Audit and Finance Committee will reconsider whether to retain PwC and may retain that firm or another firm without resubmitting the matter to our stockholders.  Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit and Finance Committee may, in its discretion, direct the appointment of a different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. Aggregate fees for professional services rendered for the Company by PwC for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were (in thousands): 2023 2022 Audit Fees $4,663 $4,993 Audit-Related Fees 75 65 Tax Fees 118 60 All Other Fees 5 5 Total $4,861 $5,123 Audit Fees were for professional services rendered for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company, statutory and regulatory audits, issuance of comfort letters, consents and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC. Audit-Related Fees were for assurance and related services related to attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. Tax Fees were for services related to tax compliance, including the preparation of tax returns and claims for refund, and tax planning and tax advice, including assistance with and representation in tax audits and appeals, and requests for rulings or technical advice from tax authorities. All Other Fees were for services rendered for accounting research, internal audit software licenses and other projects. MARATHON OIL | PROPOSAL 2: INDEPENDENT AUDITOR     66 The Audit and Finance Committee reviews and approves the fees and expenses of the independent auditor for audit, audit-related, tax and permissible non-audit services.  To assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit and Finance Committee annually reviews the independence of the independent auditors, in addition to assuring the regular rotation of the lead audit partner as required and considering whether there should be a rotation of the independent audit firm itself.  In conjunction with the mandated rotation of the lead audit partner, the Audit and Finance Committee and its chairperson are directly involved in the selection of PwC’s lead engagement partner. The Audit and Finance Committee’s Policy for Pre-Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Permissible Non-Audit Services is available at www.marathonoil.com under Investors—Corporate Governance—Policies and Reporting—Policies . Among other things, this policy sets forth the procedure for the Audit and Finance Committee to pre-approve all audit, audit-related, tax and permissible non-audit services, other than as provided under the de minimis exception.  Notwithstanding the de minimis exception, the Committee’s standard practice is to pre-approve all permissible non-audit services.  The Audit and Finance Committee has delegated pre-approval authority of up to $500,000 to the Audit and Finance Committee Chair for unbudgeted items. The Audit and Finance Committee pre-approved all the fees and services for 2023 and 2022, and did not utilize the de minimis exception in either year. Proposal 2 For the reasons stated above, your Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR Proposal 2 ratifying the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s Independent Auditor for 2024. þ 67     MARATHON OIL | PROPOSAL 2: INDEPENDENT AUDITOR PROPOSAL 3:  ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, and as a matter of good corporate governance, we seek your advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” and “Executive Compensation.” YOUR BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 3 APPROVING THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. Although this vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee values your opinion and will consider the voting results when making future decisions about executive compensation. Additionally, we believe that constructive dialogue with our stockholders provides meaningful feedback about specific executive compensation practices and programs, and we encourage our stockholders to communicate directly with both management and the Compensation Committee about executive compensation.  Stockholders may contact the Compensation Committee Chair to provide input on executive compensation matters at any time by emailing compchair@marathonoil.com . As described under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” the Compensation Committee, comprised entirely of independent directors, has established an executive compensation program that rewards both company and individual performance.  Our Compensation Committee consistently exercises great care and discipline in determining executive compensation.  Executive compensation decisions are made in order to attract, retain and motivate talented executives to deliver business results and long-term value to our stockholders. We currently seek the advisory vote of our stockholders to approve the compensation of our named executive officers on an annual basis and expect that the next such advisory vote will be held at our 2025 Annual Meeting. Proposal 3 For the reasons stated above, your Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR Proposal 3 approving the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. þ MARATHON OIL | PROPOSAL 3:  COMPENSATION ADVISORY VOTE     68 PROPOSAL 4:  APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION (“CHARTER”) TO PROVIDE FOR OFFICER EXCULPATION AS PERMITTED UNDER DELAWARE LAW You are voting on a proposal to approve an amendment to the Company’s Charter to provide for the exculpation of certain officers of the Company as permitted by recent amendments to Delaware law. In August 2022, Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) was amended to permit Delaware corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of an officer for monetary damages for certain breaches of fiduciary duty as an officer involving breaches of the duty of care. Historically, only directors could be so exculpated. The DGCL, as amended, does not permit officers to be exculpated for breaches of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, any transaction in which the officer derived an improper personal benefit or for any action brought by or in the right of the corporation, such as derivative claims. Currently, Article Eleventh of our Charter provides solely for director exculpation from monetary damages for certain breaches of fiduciary duty as a director, such as the duty of care. The protections extended to officers under Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, as amended, are not, however, identical to current director protections. The primary distinction is that corporations may not eliminate or limit liability of officers for claims brought by or on behalf of the corporation, including stockholder derivative claims. In contrast, corporations may exculpate directors for breaches of the duty of care however those claims are asserted, whether directly or derivatively. This structure means that the Board will retain its authority to assert the Company’s claims against any officer of the Company in the event of such officer’s breach of the duty of care (or, if the Board does not bring such a claim, a stockholder may do so derivatively assuming the proper procedures under the DGCL are followed). If Proposal 4 is approved by the requisite vote of the Company’s stockholders at the Annual Meeting, the Charter will be amended and restated to extend such exculpation to officers of the Company in strict compliance with Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, as amended. YOUR BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 4 APPROVING AN AMENDMENT TO OUR CHARTER TO PROVIDE FOR OFFICER EXCULPATION AS PERMITTED UNDER DELAWARE LAW The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages of amending the Charter to extend exculpation of personal liability for monetary damages for direct claims, including class actions, brought by stockholders for breaches of the duty of care to officers of the Company, as permitted and in compliance with the DGCL, as amended. The Board strongly believes that the Company’s officers should be held to the highest standards when carrying out their duties to the Company and our stockholders. Nevertheless, the potential for officers to have personal liability for decisions made or actions taken on behalf of the Company could adversely impact the ability of our officers to make decisions that are most appropriate for the Company and thereby maintain these high standards.  Aligning the protections available to our officers with those currently available to our directors to the extent these protections are available under the DGCL would empower officers to exercise their business judgment in furtherance of stockholder interests without the potential for distraction posed by the risk of personal liability. 69     MARATHON OIL | PROPOSAL 4: AMENDMENT TO CHARTER Such concerns may also limit the pool of qualified individuals willing to serve as officers of the Company, especially as our peers and others with whom we compete for talent adopt similar exculpation provisions. In the absence of this protection, these individuals might be deterred from serving as officers due to exposure to personal liability and the risk of incurring substantial expense in defending lawsuits, regardless of merit.  Further, the potential for personal liability can increase the costs incurred by the Company to procure liability insurance for claims against our officers. By amending the current exculpation provision in the Company’s Charter to also provide exculpation for officers, these concerns and costs may be reduced. Additionally, more closely aligning the exculpation of directors and officers will remove a discrepancy in the treatment of directors for direct claims brought by stockholders for breaches of the duty of care that is not currently afforded to our officers. The proposed amendments will not affect any other traditional checks against officers, as claims may still be brought against them for breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty or actions taken in bad faith, and the Board and stockholders, as applicable, bringing suits derivatively on behalf of the corporation may still bring fiduciary claims against officers. Accordingly, after carefully reviewing these considerations, including the potential benefits anticipated to accrue to the Company and our stockholders, and taking into account the narrow class and type of claims that the officers would be exculpated from liability for, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to amend the Charter as set forth herein, and has unanimously approved, and recommended that the Company’s stockholders approve, such amendments to the Charter. Complete Text of Proposed Amendments to the Charter The foregoing description of the proposed amendments to the Charter contemplated by this Proposal 4 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Charter, which is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. Proposed additions are underlined, and proposed deletions are stricken through. If this Proposal 4 is approved by the Company’s stockholders at the Annual Meeting, the proposed amendment to the Charter will become effective upon the filing of the Charter with the Delaware Secretary of State. This filing is expected to occur shortly after the Annual Meeting. If this Proposal 4 is not approved by the requisite vote of the Company’s stockholders at the Annual Meeting, Article Eleventh will remain unchanged, our directors will continue to be exculpated from liability under the existing director exculpation provision provided thereunder and our officers will not be entitled to exculpation under the DGCL. Proposal 4 For the reasons stated above, your Board of Directors recommends a vote for Proposal 4 approving an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to provide for officer exculpation as permitted under Delaware law. þ MARATHON OIL | PROPOSAL 4: AMENDMENT TO CHARTER     70 Q&A ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING When and where is the Annual Meeting?

MARATHON OIL | OTHER BUSINESS    76 ANNEX A Non-GAAP Reconciliations Marathon Oil’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 are presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Certain measures in this Proxy Statement do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by US GAAP and therefore, are considered non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures are not alternatives to GAAP measures, and you should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. This Proxy Statement contains references to the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (Adjusted CFO) Our presentation of adjusted CFO is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted CFO is defined as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for changes in working capital. Management believes this is useful to investors as an indicator of Marathon Oil’s ability to generate cash quarterly or year-to-date by eliminating differences caused by the timing of certain working capital items. (in millions) 2023 Net cash flow provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 4,087 Changes in working capital $ 100 Adjusted CFO $ 4,187 Adjusted Free Cash Flow Our presentation of adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted free cash flow before dividend (“adjusted free cash flow”) is defined as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for working capital, capital expenditures, and EG LNG return of capital and other. Management believes this is useful to investors as a measure of Marathon Oil’s ability to fund its capital expenditure programs, service debt and other distributions to stockholders.

The reinvestment rate is defined as total capital expenditures divided by operating cash flow before changes in working capital and EG return of capital and other. Management believes the reinvestment rate is useful to investors to demonstrate the Company’s commitment to generating cash for use towards investor-friendly purposes (which includes balance sheet enhancement, base dividend and other return of capital). (in millions) 2023 Capital expenditures (GAAP) $ 2,033 Adjusted CFO $ 4,187 EG return of capital and other $ 28 Reinvestment Rate 48 % Cash Flow per Debt Adjusted Share Cash flow per debt adjusted share is calculated by dividing operating cash flow before working capital plus net interest after tax by total shares including debt shares (debt shares are the average net debt during a calendar year divided by the stock price, or simply equitizing debt). Cash flow per debt adjusted share is a non-GAAP measure for which there is no GAAP equivalent.
