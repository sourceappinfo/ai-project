    Chicago, Illinois 60604, on Thursday, June 22, 2006, at
    9:00 a.m. Central Time, or at any proper adjournments.
    The mailing address of our principal executive offices is
    2704 West Roscoe Street, Chicago, Illinois 60618. If you properly execute and return your proxy card, it will be
    voted in accordance with your instructions. If you return your
    signed proxy but give us no instructions as to one or more
    matters, the proxy will be voted on those matters in accordance
    with the recommendations of our Board of Directors as indicated
    in this proxy statement. You may revoke your proxy, at any time
    before it is voted, by written notice to us, by submission of
    another proxy bearing a later date or by voting in person at the
    meeting. Your revocation will not affect a vote on any matters
    already taken. Your mere presence at the meeting will not revoke
    your proxy. This solicitation is made by Midway Games Inc. We are mailing
    this proxy statement and the accompanying form of proxy
    beginning on or about April 28, 2006, to our stockholders
    of record on April 24, 2006 (the “Record Date”).
    In addition to the solicitation of proxies by use of the mails,
    some of our officers, directors and other employees may also
    solicit proxies personally or by mail, courier, electronic mail,
    telephone or facsimile transmission, but they will not receive
    additional compensation for those services. We will ask
    brokerage firms, custodians, banks, nominees and other
    fiduciaries holding shares of our common stock in their names to
    forward proxy soliciting material to their principals, and we
    will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. There will not be any costs in connection with this
    solicitation, except for the costs of preparation, printing and
    mailing this proxy statement and our annual report to
    stockholders, the cost of which will be borne by Midway. Only holders of our common stock, $.01 par value per share,
    of record at the close of business on the Record Date will be
    entitled to vote at our annual meeting or any adjournments.
    There were 91,351,225 shares of our common stock
    outstanding on the Record Date (excluding treasury shares). Each
    share of our common stock entitles the holder to one vote on
    each matter at the meeting. Approval
    of Proposals The affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of our common
    stock present in person or by proxy is required to elect
    directors, and the affirmative vote of a majority of our common
    stock present and entitled to vote is required to approve the
    other proposal. As of the Record Date, Sumner M. Redstone and his related
    parties controlled over 87% of our outstanding common stock. See
    “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
    Management” below. Mr. Redstone and Shari E. Redstone
    have advised us that they intend to cause all the shares of our
    common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Redstone, NAI and
    Sumco, to be voted in favor of each of the proposals described
    in this proxy statement, which will ensure the approval of each
    such proposal at the meeting. Ms. Redstone, as President of
    each of NAI and Sumco, has sole authority to exercise voting
    rights of the common stock beneficially owned by NAI and Sumco.
    Our directors have also advised us that they intend to vote in
    favor of each proposal. Table of Contents Through their ownership of our common stock, Mr. Redstone
    and his related parties control the outcome of corporate actions
    that require the approval of our stockholders, including the
    election of our directors, among others. Mr. Redstone
    serves as Executive Chairman of the board of directors of Viacom
    Inc. (“Viacom”) and Chairman of the board of directors
    of CBS Corporation (“CBS”), an affiliate of
    Viacom. Mr. Redstone’s daughter, Shari E. Redstone, is
    the Vice Chairwoman of our Board of Directors; the Non-Executive
    Vice Chair of both the boards of directors of Viacom and CBS;
    and President of both NAI and Sumco. As President of each of NAI
    and Sumco, Ms. Redstone has sole authority with respect to
    each company’s investments in our company, including sole
    voting and investment power with respect to shares of our common
    stock. Another member of our Board, Joseph A.
    Califano, Jr., serves on the board of directors of CBS.
    Mr. Califano served on the Viacom board of directors from
    2003 until the split of Viacom and CBS in 2005. In public filings, Mr. Redstone reported that he has
    engaged a financial advisor to provide services in connection
    with the evaluation of a possible “going private” or
    other transaction. In public filings, he also stated that Midway
    could be considered as a potential Viacom acquisition candidate.
    In 2004 Viacom established an Ad Hoc Committee on Electronic
    Games to consider any proposed transactions or business
    arrangements between Viacom and Midway. According to
    Viacom’s proxy statement for its 2005 annual meeting filed
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that committee was
    comprised of three independent directors who were disinterested
    with respect to matters relating to Midway. According to
    Viacom’s proxy statement for its 2006 annual meeting filed
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it dissolved the
    Ad Hoc Committee in connection with the separation of
    Viacom and CBS on December 31, 2005. Neither
    Mr. Redstone nor Viacom has made any proposals to Midway
    regarding any proposed material corporate transactions or
    business arrangements. Midway also has formed a special
    independent committee to consider any proposed transactions
    between Midway and Mr. Redstone or any of his affiliates,
    comprised of three independent directors who are disinterested
    with respect to matters relating to Mr. Redstone and his
    affiliates. See “Corporate
    Governance — Committees of the Board of
    Directors” below. SECURITY

    Mr. Zucker’s employment is terminated by us for

    of Directors Our Board of Directors is our ultimate decision-making body,
    responsible for overseeing our affairs, except with respect to
    those matters reserved to the stockholders by law or under our
    By-laws. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Principles
    and a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, each of which can be
    viewed on our Internet website at www.investor.midway.com. These documents describe the
    responsibilities of our directors, the organization of our Board

    common stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock
    Exchange. The listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange
    impose requirements on the board of directors and committees of
    listed issuers that include, among others, the following
    requirements: • A majority of the members of the board of directors must qualify
    as “independent” directors who have no material
    relationship with the issuer other than serving as a director
    and who meet the other requirements of independence set forth in
    Section 303A.02 of the listing standards of the New York
    Stock Exchange; • Issuers have a nominating and corporate governance committee (or
    committees that are responsible for each of these functions)
    composed entirely of independent directors; and • Issuers have a compensation committee composed entirely of
    independent directors. The New York Stock Exchange permits “controlled
    companies” to take advantage of exemptions from the above
    three requirements. For these purposes, a controlled company is
    a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by
    an individual, a group or another company. Since
    Mr. Redstone’s ownership of our common stock exceeds
    50%, we are a controlled company. However, our Board of
    Directors has determined that, at present, we will not elect to
    take advantage of any of the above exemptions from the New York
    Stock Exchange listing standards. Director Independence. It has been our policy,
    and unless we elect to rely on a controlled company exemption it
    is a requirement of the listing standards of the New York Stock
    Exchange, that a majority of the members of our Board must
    qualify as “independent” directors who have no
    material relationship with us, other than serving as a director.
    Our Board has adopted the following categorical standards to
    assist it in making independence determinations, as permitted by
    New York Stock Exchange rules, and has determined that any
    director who meets these standards shall be deemed an
    independent director: • The director is not and has not been our employee for at least
    three years, and no member of the director’s immediate
    family is or has been our executive officer for at least three
    years; • The director has not received, and no member of his immediate
    family has received during any 12-month period in the last three years, more than $100,000 per year
    in direct compensation from us, other than director and
    committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred
    compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is
    not contingent in any way on continued service); • Neither the director nor any member of his immediate family
    (x) is a partner or employee of a firm that is our internal
    or external auditor or (y) was, within the last three
    years, a partner or employee of such a firm and personally
    worked on our audit within that time; • Neither the director nor any member of his immediate family has
    been employed within the last three years as an executive
    officer of another company where any of our present executive
    officers at the same time serves or served on that
    company’s compensation committee; and • A director is not an executive officer or an employee, and no
    member of his immediate family is an executive officer, of a
    company that in any of the last three fiscal years has made
    payments to, or received payments from us for property or
    services in an amount which, in any such single fiscal year,
    exceeded the greater of $1 million, or 2% of such other
    company’s consolidated gross revenues. 6 Table of Contents Our Board has determined that all of the existing members of our
    Board of Directors meet these categorical standards and are
    therefore independent directors. Our new director nominee also
    meets these standards. In addition, to be nominated for election
    to our Board, all director candidates must satisfy the
    qualification standards discussed below under the heading
    “Nominating Committee Policies.” Board and Committee Meetings. During fiscal
    2005, the Board held fourteen meetings. Each director attended
    at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board
    and all committees on which he or she served during the fiscal
    year. Director
    Compensation In 2005, we paid a fee of $32,500 per year to each director
    who is not also our employee. Beginning in 2006, we will pay a
    fee of $45,000 per year to each director who is not also
    our employee. We pay the Chairman of our Board of Directors an
    additional fee of $48,000 per year. A director who serves
    as the Chairman of the Compensation Committee, Special Committee
    of Independent Directors or Nominating Committee of our Board of
    Directors receives a further fee of $2,500 per year for his
    or her services in that capacity, and each other member of those
    Committees receives an additional fee of $1,000 per year. A
    director who serves as the Chairman of the Corporate Governance
    Committee of the Board receives a further fee of $7,500 per
    year for his or her services in that capacity, and each other
    member of that Committee receives an additional fee of
    $5,000 per year. A director who serves as the Chairman of
    the Audit Committee of the Board receives a further fee of
    $20,000 per year for his or her services in that capacity,
    and each other member of that committee receives an additional
    fee of $15,000 per year. Our directors may also receive
    options to purchase shares of common stock under our 2005
    Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”). Some of our directors are eligible to receive reimbursement for
    health insurance costs under our Exec-U-Care supplemental health
    care insurance program. In fiscal 2005, we paid the following
    amounts for current and former directors under this program:
    $5,561 to Kenneth D. Cron, $10,223 to Robert N. Waxman, $1,059
    to our former Chairman, Neil D. Nicastro, $7,438 to our former
    director Harold H. Bach Jr. and $275 to our former director,
    Richard D. White. Committees
    of the Board of Directors To assist it in carrying out its duties, the Board has delegated
    specific authority to several committees. In addition, our
    directors, none of whom are members of management, hold regular
    executive sessions without management being present.
    Mr. Cron, the Chairman of our Board, presides at these
    sessions. We have the following standing committees of the Board: Audit
    Committee, Nominating Committee, Corporate Governance Committee
    and Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors has
    determined that all of the members of these committees are
    “independent” directors as that term is defined under
    the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. The Audit Committee is composed of four independent
    directors (as independence is defined in the New York Stock
    Exchange listing standards and Securities and Exchange
    Commission rules): Messrs. Waxman (Chairman), Bartholomay,
    Brown and Califano. The Board has determined that
    Messrs. Brown and Waxman are each an audit committee
    “financial expert” as defined in Regulation S-K Item 401(h)(2). In addition, each member of our Audit
    Committee is financially literate, in the Board’s
    determination, and satisfies the definition of
    “independence” required of audit committee members
    under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and
    Securities and Exchange Commission rules. This committee meets periodically with the independent auditors
    and internal personnel to: (1) consider the adequacy of
    internal accounting controls, our internal audit function and
    finance department staffing; (2) receive and review the
    recommendations of the independent and internal auditors;
    (3) select, engage and review the performance of our
    independent and internal auditors and monitor the independence
    of our independent auditors; (4) review and approve the
    scope of the audit and determine the compensation of our
    independent auditors; (5) pre-approve permitted non-audit
    fees and services; (6) review our consolidated financial
    statements and other financial disclosures; (7) receive and
    review confidential concerns regarding accounting or auditing
    matters; (8) monitor our 7 Table of Contents compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;
    (9) discuss our policies with respect to risk assessment
    and risk management; (10) review our accounting policies
    and accounting developments; and (11) resolve potential
    conflicts between management and our independent auditors. A
    copy of the written charter for this committee is included as Appendix A to this proxy statement. The report of
    this committee is set forth later in this proxy statement.
    During fiscal 2005, this committee held eight meetings. The Nominating Committee is composed of three independent
    directors: Ms. Redstone (Chairwoman), Mr. Califano and
    Mr. Cron. This committee identifies and evaluates
    individuals qualified to become Board members, including those
    recommended by stockholders, and recommends the nomination of
    candidates for election to the Board, as discussed in greater
    detail below. This committee also recommends nominees for
    appointment to the various committees. During fiscal 2005, this
    committee held two meetings. The Corporate Governance Committee is composed of three
    independent directors: Mr. Sheinfeld (Chairman),
    Mr. Califano and Ms. Redstone. This committee makes
    recommendations regarding corporate governance policies and
    procedures and Board organization and oversees the annual
    evaluation of the Board and management. During fiscal 2005, this
    committee held three meetings. The Compensation Committee is composed of three
    independent directors who are also outside directors under
    rule 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986:
    Mr. Bartholomay (Chairman), Mr. Cron and
    Ms. Redstone. This committee (1) reviews and approves
    corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of
    our Chief Executive Officer and our other senior officers;
    (2) reviews periodically the succession plans relating to
    the Chief Executive Officer and the other senior officers;
    (3) evaluates the Chief Executive Officer’s
    performance and, either as a committee or together with other
    independent directors, determines the compensation of the Chief
    Executive Officer; (4) makes recommendations to the Board
    with respect to compensation of the other senior officers;
    (5) administers, approves and ratifies awards under our
    stock option, incentive-compensation and other benefit plans,
    including determining the timing, pricing and amount of grants
    and awards to be made under the provisions of our compensation
    plans; and (6) revises executive employment agreements. The
    report of this committee is set forth later in this proxy
    statement. During fiscal 2005, this committee held four meetings. Committee Charters. The Board has adopted a
    written charter for each of these committees, which is available
    on our website at www.investor.midway.com. Additional
    copies of the charters are available in print without charge to
    any of our stockholders requesting such information by
    contacting us at: Midway Games Inc., 2704 West Roscoe
    Street, Chicago, IL 60618, Attention: Investor Relations. Special Committee of Independent Directors. In
    addition to the standing committees described above, on
    September 14, 2004, the Board established a special
    committee of independent directors to consider any proposed
    transactions between Midway and Mr. Redstone or any of his
    affiliated companies. The committee members are
    Messrs. Cron (Chairman), Bartholomay and Waxman. These
    transactions may include ordinary course of business
    transactions, such as those between Midway and NAI or Midway and
    subsidiaries of Viacom, or may involve proposals regarding
    material corporate transactions. During fiscal 2005, this
    committee held four meetings. Compensation
    Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation During fiscal 2005, Messrs. Bartholomay (Chairman) and Cron
    and Ms. Redstone served on our Compensation Committee. No
    member of our Compensation Committee is or was an employee or
    officer of Midway, and no officer, director or other person had
    any relationship required to be disclosed under this heading.
    Mr. Bartholomay is Group Vice Chairman of Willis Group
    Holdings, Ltd. and Vice Chairman of Willis North America, Inc.,
    insurance brokers, which we retained to provide insurance
    brokerage services during fiscal 2005 and propose to retain for
    insurance brokerage services during the current fiscal year. 8 Table of Contents Nominating
    Committee Policies Our Nominating Committee charter is available on our website at www.investor.midway.com. It describes the authority and
    responsibilities of the committee and its process for
    identifying director candidates as well as other policies and
    procedures. The
    Process of Identifying and Evaluating Candidates for
    Directors Our Nominating Committee identifies and evaluates director
    candidates and recommends the selection of nominees to our Board
    of Directors. The Board then considers the recommendation and
    selects the nominees. In recommending candidates for nomination
    for election to the Board at our annual meetings of
    stockholders, the Nominating Committee begins by determining
    whether the incumbent directors, whose terms expire at the
    meeting, desire and are qualified to continue their service on
    the Board and evaluates their performance on the Board. We are
    of the view that the continuing service of qualified incumbents
    promotes stability and continuity in the boardroom, giving us
    the benefit of the familiarity and insight into our affairs that
    our directors have accumulated during their tenure, while
    contributing to the Board’s ability to work as a collective
    body. If there are new Board positions or vacancies on the Board, the
    Nominating Committee will solicit recommendations for nominees
    from persons whom the Nominating Committee believes are likely
    to be familiar with qualified candidates, including members of
    the Board and senior management. The Nominating Committee may
    also engage a search firm to assist in identifying qualified
    candidates. The Nominating Committee will review and evaluate
    each candidate whom it believes merits serious consideration,
    taking into account all available information concerning the
    candidate, the qualifications for Board membership established
    by the Nominating Committee, the existing composition and mix of
    talent and expertise on the Board and other factors that it
    deems relevant. In conducting its review and evaluation, the
    Nominating Committee may solicit the views of management and
    other members of the Board and may, if deemed helpful, conduct
    interviews of proposed candidates. The Nominating Committee will evaluate candidates recommended by
    stockholders in the same manner as candidates recommended by
    other persons, except that the Nominating Committee may
    consider, as one of the factors in its evaluation of
    stockholder-recommended candidates, the size and duration of the
    interest of the recommending stockholder or stockholder group in
    our equity securities. Qualifications
    of Directors Our policy is generally to require that all candidates for
    director be persons of integrity and sound ethical character and
    judgment, have no interests that materially conflict with ours
    or those of our stockholders generally, have meaningful
    business, governmental or technical experience and acumen and
    have adequate time to devote to service on the Board. We have
    also required that a majority of directors be independent; at
    least three of the directors must have the financial literacy
    and special independence qualifications necessary for service on
    the Audit Committee, and at least one of these directors must
    qualify as an audit committee financial expert. Stockholder
    Recommendation of Candidates for Election as
    Directors The Nominating Committee will consider recommendations for
    director nominations submitted by stockholders that individually
    or as a group have beneficial ownership of at least 3% of our
    common stock and have had such ownership for at least one year.
    Submissions must be made in accordance with the committee’s
    procedures, as outlined below and set forth in Appendix B to this proxy statement. For each annual
    meeting of our stockholders, the Nominating Committee will
    accept for consideration only one recommendation from any
    stockholder or affiliated group of stockholders. The committee
    waives this requirement with respect to Mr. Redstone, NAI
    and Sumco in view of their majority ownership of our common
    stock. The Nominating Committee will only consider candidates
    who satisfy our minimum qualifications for director, as outlined
    above. 9 Table of Contents Procedures
    for Stockholder Submission of Nominating
    Recommendations A stockholder wishing to recommend to the Nominating Committee a
    candidate for election as director must submit the
    recommendation in writing, addressed to the committee
    c/o our corporate secretary at 2704 West Roscoe
    Street, Chicago, Illinois 60618. Submissions recommending
    candidates for election at an annual meeting of stockholders
    must be received no later than 120 calendar days prior to the
    first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the
    prior annual meeting of stockholders. In the event that the date
    of the next annual meeting of stockholders is more than
    30 days following or preceding the first anniversary date
    of the annual meeting of stockholders for the prior year, the
    submission must be made a reasonable time in advance of the
    mailing of our next annual proxy statement. Each nominating
    recommendation must be accompanied by the information called for
    by our “Procedures for Stockholders Submitting Nominating
    Recommendations,” which is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement. This includes specified information
    concerning the stockholder or group of stockholders making the
    recommendation, the proposed nominee, relationships between the
    recommending stockholder and the proposed nominee and the
    qualifications of the proposed nominee to serve as director,
    describing the contributions that the nominee would be expected
    to make to the Board. The recommendation must also be
    accompanied by the consent of the proposed nominee to serve if
    nominated and the agreement of the nominee to be interviewed by
    the Nominating Committee, if the Nominating Committee decides in
    its discretion to do so. Selection
    of 2006 Nominees All of the nominees listed on the accompanying proxy card except
    for Mr. Steele are currently serving on our Board and are
    standing for reelection. The new nominee, Mr. Steele, was
    recommended to our Nominating Committee by Ms. Redstone, a
    non-management director. We did not receive any recommendations
    from stockholders for nominees that are required to be
    identified in this proxy statement. Stockholder
    Communications with Directors Stockholders may communicate with our Board of Directors, any
    committee of the Board or any individual director, and any
    interested party may communicate with our Chairman of the Board
    or the non-management directors of the Board, by following the
    procedures set forth below. Our acceptance and forwarding of
    communications to the directors does not imply that the
    directors owe or assume duties to persons submitting the
    communications, the duties of the directors being only those
    prescribed by applicable law, our By-laws or our policies
    adopted by the Board. All communications should be delivered either in writing
    c/o Legal Department, Midway Games Inc., at 2704 West
    Roscoe Street, Chicago, Illinois 60618; or by e-mail to

    statement of the type and amount of our securities that the
    person holds; • if the person submitting the communication is not a stockholder
    and is submitting the communication to our Chairman of the Board
    or to our non-management directors as an interested party, the
    nature of the person’s interest in us; • any special interest, meaning an interest not in the capacity as
    a stockholder of ours, of each person in the subject matter of
    the communication; and • the address, telephone number and any e-mail address of the person submitting the communication. It is not appropriate to send, and we may decline to forward,
    the following types of communications to directors: • communications regarding individual grievances or other
    interests that are personal to the party submitting the
    communication and could not reasonably be construed to be of
    concern to our stockholders or other constituencies generally; 10 Table of Contents • communications that advocate our engaging in illegal activities; • communications that, under community standards, contain
    offensive, scurrilous or abusive content; and • advertisements, solicitations, form letters and communications
    that have no reasonable relevance to our business or operations. All communications that comply with the requirements that are
    described here will be relayed to the person or persons to whom
    they are addressed. Communications addressed to directors may,
    at the direction of the addressees, be shared with Company
    management. Director
    Attendance at Annual Meetings Each of our directors is expected to be present at our annual
    meetings of stockholders, absent exigent circumstances that
    prevent his or her attendance. Where a director is unable to
    attend an annual meeting in person but is able to do so by
    electronic conferencing, we will arrange for the director’s
    participation by means where the director can hear, and be
    heard, by those present at the meeting. At last year’s
    annual meeting, six of our seven directors attended in person
    and one director attended by electronic conferencing. EXECUTIVE

    of Stock Option Plans 2005
    Long-Term Incentive Plan At our annual meeting on June 6, 2005, our stockholders
    ratified our 2005 Plan, which was approved by our Board of
    Directors on March 10, 2005 and replaced all of the shares
    available for issuance under our 15 Table of Contents previous stock option plans. (See “Previous Incentive
    Plans” below. Awards previously issued under the earlier
    plans will remain in effect under those plans.) The 2005 Plan is
    administered by our Compensation Committee, except that our
    Board of Directors must administer the 2005 Plan for purposes of
    granting awards to non-employee directors. The 2005 Plan
    authorizes a broad range of awards, including, stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock,
    other awards based on our common stock, dividend equivalents,
    performance shares or other stock-based performance awards,
    cash-based performance awards tied to achievement of specific
    performance objectives and shares issuable in lieu of rights to
    cash compensation. Shares reserved for new grants under the
    former plans, plus shares recaptured from outstanding awards
    under the former plans that expire unexercised or are
    terminated, are available for issuance under the 2005 Plan. Our
    employees, non-employee directors, advisors and consultants are
    eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan contains certain restrictions, including
    non-compete, non-solicitation and non-disclosure provisions,
    that govern the behavior of participants, other than
    non-employee directors, during their employment with us and for
    12 months after termination of their employment. Compliance
    with these restrictions is a pre-condition to a
    participant’s right to realize and retain any gain from
    awards under the plan. In the event that a participant fails to
    comply with these restrictions, we have the right to recover all
    gains derived from plan-based awards realized by that
    participant at any time after the date six months prior to the
    forfeiture event or, after termination of employment, six months
    prior to the participant’s termination of employment, and
    to cancel any outstanding awards. Our Compensation Committee has
    discretion to waive or modify our right to forfeiture, or to
    include additional forfeiture provisions in the agreement
    governing any plan award. Previous
    Incentive Plans We currently have options outstanding under a 2002 Non-Qualified
    Stock Option Plan, a 2002 Stock Option Plan, a 2000
    Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, a 1999 Stock Option Plan, a
    1998 Stock Incentive Plan, a 1998 Non-Qualified Stock Option
    Plan and a 1996 Stock Option Plan. The plans were intended to
    encourage stock ownership by their participants and thereby
    enhance participant identification with our stockholders’
    interests. Subject to the provisions of the plans, the
    Compensation Committee determined which of the eligible
    directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors
    received stock options, the terms including applicable vesting
    periods of the options, and the number of shares for which
    options are granted. The exercise price per share for each
    option was determined by the Compensation Committee and
    generally was not less than 100% of the fair market value of our
    common stock on the date the option was granted. The plans each
    have a term of ten years, unless terminated earlier. We adopted a salary and director fee reduction/stock option
    program under the 2002 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan.
    Employees and directors who elected to participate in the
    program reduced their base salary or director’s fee. For
    each dollar of salary or fee reduction, participants were
    granted options to purchase one and one-half shares of our
    common stock at an exercise price of $5.29. The options are
    exercisable until September 2, 2012. We also assumed the options outstanding under the stock option
    plan of Inevitable Entertainment Inc. on October 5, 2004 in
    connection with our acquisition of Inevitable. For a discussion of Mr. Zucker’s stock options and
    restricted stock agreement, see “Employment
    Agreements” below. Senior
    Employee Bonus Incentive Plan Our executive officers and other senior employees are eligible
    for participation in the Amended and Restated Midway Incentive
    Plan, which was amended by the Board on March 10, 2005. The
    plan offers participants the opportunity to receive bonuses
    based on a combination of the following factors: (1) a
    percentage of each participant’s base salary determined by
    management; (2) the achievement of targets set by
    management for our financial performance; and
    (3) management’s evaluation of the degree to which a
    participant meets individual performance goals. Even if Midway
    does not meet financial performance targets for years after
    2005, participants may receive part of their bonus based on
    achieving their individual performance goals. No bonuses were
    awarded or paid out under the plan in 2005. 16 Table of Contents REPORT OF
    THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION FOR FISCAL 2005 The Compensation Committee, either as a committee or together
    with other independent directors as directed by the Board of
    Directors, is responsible for determining the compensation of
    our Chief Executive Officer and for making recommendations to
    the Board of Directors regarding the compensation of our other
    executive officers. It is the policy of the Compensation Committee to provide
    attractive compensation packages to executive officers so as to
    motivate them to devote their full energies to our business, to
    reward them for their services and to align the interests of
    senior management with the interests of stockholders. Our
    executive compensation packages are comprised primarily of base
    salaries, annual contractual and discretionary cash bonuses,
    stock options and awards, and retirement and other benefits. It
    is the philosophy of the Compensation Committee that Midway be
    staffed with a small number of well-compensated executive
    officers. In establishing compensation levels, we consider
    compensation paid by our principal competitors. In general, the level of base salary is intended to provide
    appropriate basic pay to executive officers taking into account
    their historical contributions to our business, each
    person’s unique education, skills and value, the
    recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer and the
    competitive marketplace for executive talent. The amount of any
    discretionary bonus is subjective but is generally based on our
    actual financial performance in the preceding fiscal year, the
    special contribution of the executive to this performance and
    the overall level of the executive’s compensation including
    other elements of the compensation package. Contractual bonuses
    are likewise designed to give effect to one or more of these
    factors. For fiscal years beginning in 2003 and thereafter, we
    adopted the Midway Incentive Plan. In view of the fact that we
    were not profitable in 2005, no bonuses were awarded to our
    executive officers under the plan and no discretionary bonuses
    were awarded to them. Generally, the Compensation Committee determines the size of
    stock option grants to our executive officers on an individual,
    discretionary basis in consideration of financial corporate
    results and each recipient’s performance, contributions and
    responsibilities without assigning specific weight to any of
    these factors. We also have used stock options, which increase
    in value only if our common stock increases in value, and which
    terminate a short time after an executive leaves our employ, as
    a means of long-term incentive compensation. During 2005, no
    options were granted to executive officers other than to David
    Zucker, our Chief Executive Officer, as required under his
    employment agreement. The Compensation Committee used the
    services of an outside consultant to develop the 2005 Plan,
    pursuant to which a broad range of equity based and non-equity
    based awards could be granted to and earned by executives based
    upon performance over a period of time to reward annual,
    intermediate and long-term performance and encourage retention.
    The 2005 Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on
    March 10, 2005 and was ratified by stockholders at our
    June 6, 2005 annual meeting. Mr. Zucker’s compensation arrangements are provided
    for under his employment agreement dated May 6, 2003,
    including stock option grants and restricted stock awards. His
    employment agreement was negotiated at arm’s length by the
    Compensation Committee, with the assistance of an outside
    consultant. Among other matters, in negotiating this agreement,
    we considered compensation levels of chief executives at our
    principal competitors. The agreement had an initial term of two
    years expiring May 6, 2005, and automatically renews
    thereafter for successive one year periods until terminated. 17 Table of Contents The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the “Budget
    Act”) generally provides that publicly-held corporations
    will only be able to deduct, for income tax purposes,
    compensation paid to the chief executive officer or any of the
    four most highly paid senior executive officers in excess of one
    million dollars per year if it is paid pursuant to qualifying
    performance-based compensation plans approved by stockholders.
    Compensation as defined by the Budget Act includes, among other
    things, base salary, incentive compensation and gains on stock
    option transactions. Total compensation of some of our officers
    may be paid under plans or agreements that have not been
    approved by stockholders and may exceed one million dollars in a
    particular fiscal year. We will not be able to deduct these
    excess payments for income tax purposes. The Compensation
    Committee intends to consider, on a case by case basis, how the
    Budget Act will affect our compensation plans and contractual
    and discretionary cash compensation, taking into account, among
    other matters, our substantial net operating loss carryforwards. Respectfully submitted by the Compensation Committee of the
    Board of Directors. William C. Bartholomay, Chairman Kenneth D.

    AGREEMENTS We employ David F. Zucker as our President and Chief Executive
    Officer under the terms of an Employment Agreement dated
    May 6, 2003. Mr. Zucker’s base salary is
    $600,000 per year. The agreement provides for bonus
    compensation of up to 100% of his base salary each year, based
    upon financial and other performance criteria mutually agreed to
    annually between Mr. Zucker and the Board of Directors. The
    agreement had an initial term of two years ended May 6,
    2005 and automatically renews thereafter for successive one-year
    periods until terminated. The employment agreement also provides that Mr. Zucker may
    participate in and receive the benefits of any disability,
    hospitalization, insurance, medical service or other
    health-related employee benefit plan, or any pension or
    retirement plan, that is generally available to executive
    employees, including the Exec-U-Care insurance program. The employment agreement will terminate automatically upon
    Mr. Zucker’s death. We may terminate the employment
    agreement if Mr. Zucker is disabled for 120 consecutive
    business days, or for six months in any 12-month period, and is not able to resume his duties within 30 days
    of our giving him notice of our intention to terminate his
    employment. 19 Table of Contents Under the employment agreement, we may terminate Mr. Zucker
    at any time with or without cause. “Cause” means: • the conviction of a felony, or of any other crime involving
    fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust relating to our company or
    Mr. Zucker’s employment; • Mr. Zucker’s failure and refusal to follow a
    reasonable direction of our Board of Directors after written
    notice of the failure or refusal and a cure period of ten days; • the commission of any dishonest or grossly negligent act that
    has or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
    our company or our customer or trade relationships provided that
    the act was not taken with the approval of our Board of
    Directors; or • a breach by Mr. Zucker of any material provision of his
    employment agreement, including representations and warranties,
    after written notice and a cure period of ten days. In addition, Mr. Zucker may resign from his employment at
    any time with or without good reason. Under the agreement,
    “good reason” means the occurrence, without
    Mr. Zucker’s consent or acquiescence, of any of the
    following events: • a breach by us of any material provision of the agreement,
    including representations and warranties, after written notice
    and a cure period of ten days; • any material diminution or reduction in Mr. Zucker’s
    duties, whether in scope or nature, or Mr. Zucker is
    required to report to anyone other than our Board of Directors
    or any committee of our Board of Directors; • our Board of Directors elects an executive officer senior in
    rank to Mr. Zucker; or • our principal place of business is moved more than
    50 miles, and as a result, Mr. Zucker’s commute
    to work is increased by more than 50 miles each way. If we terminate Mr. Zucker’s employment other than for
    cause, death or disability, including the non-renewal of his
    employment agreement at the expiration of its term, or if
    Mr. Zucker resigns for good reason, we must pay
    Mr. Zucker: • his base salary through his termination date, within
    30 days after the date of termination; • within 30 days after we publicly announce our audited
    results for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, his
    prorated bonus through the date of termination; and • an amount equal to two times his base salary in effect on the
    date of termination, payable 25% on the date of termination, and
    an additional 25% on each of 121 days, 242 days and
    365 days thereafter. If we terminate Mr. Zucker’s employment for cause or
    if he resigns without good reason, the employment agreement
    terminates, and we are required to pay to Mr. Zucker only
    his base salary through his termination date and a prorated
    bonus. If there were a change of control by reason of the individuals
    who presently constitute our Board of Directors, or successors
    approved by these Board members, cease for any reason to
    constitute at least a majority of our Board of Directors and
    Mr. Zucker elects to terminate his employment because he is
    not offered the opportunity to continue as Chief Executive
    Officer on the terms of his employment agreement or the change
    of control were to occur within three months after we terminate
    Mr. Zucker without cause or he resigns for good reason,
    then we would be obligated to pay to Mr. Zucker a lump sum
    payment equal to 2.99 times (i) one year’s base salary
    at the rate of $600,000 per year and (ii) the bonus
    payable to Mr. Zucker for the fiscal year immediately prior
    to the change of control. In addition, all unexpired and
    unvested options to purchase securities or restricted securities
    would immediately vest on the date of the change in control. Mr. Zucker has agreed not to compete with us during his
    employment and for a period of one year after termination of his
    employment for any reason. 20 Table of Contents If any portion of the amount paid to Mr. Zucker is subject
    to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then we must pay additional
    compensation to Mr. Zucker to the extent necessary to
    eliminate the economic effect on him of the resulting excise tax. Under the employment agreement, on May 6, 2003
    Mr. Zucker was granted ten-year non-qualified options to
    purchase 1,500,000 shares of our common stock at an
    exercise price of $3.57 per share and was issued 125,000
    restricted shares of our common stock. The option covering 1,000,000 shares out of the 1,500,000
    is subject to the terms of a stock option agreement dated
    May 6, 2003 and provides that the option may be exercised
    for up to 62,500 shares on or after November 1, 2004
    and the remaining 937,500 shares become exercisable in ten
    equal quarterly installments on the first day of each February,
    May, August and November thereafter. The option agreement also
    provides that whenever we issued additional shares of our common
    stock prior to May 6, 2005, we would grant him an
    additional option to purchase shares of our common stock in an
    amount (a) equal to 3.23% of the shares so issued prior to
    May 6, 2004, and (b) after May 6, 2004 and until
    May 6, 2005, equal to the percentage of the shares so
    issued (but not to exceed 3.23%) determined by dividing
    (i) the number of shares then issuable under unexercised
    options held by Mr. Zucker immediately prior to the
    issuance by (ii) the number of outstanding shares of common
    stock immediately prior to the issuance. In each case, the
    exercise price of each additional option was at the closing
    price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the option.
    In no event, however could the shares subject to additional
    options exceed 2,250,000. The additional options were also
    subject to the vesting schedule. Through the May 6, 2005
    term date of his option agreement, we issued options to
    Mr. Zucker to purchase up to 1,177,589 shares at
    exercise prices ranging from $2.92 per share to
    $12.85 per share under this provision. On June 15,
    2005, we removed from registration the remaining
    1,072,411 shares that will not be issued to Mr. Zucker
    under his agreement. The option with respect to the other 500,000 shares is
    subject to our 2005 Plan and is fully exercisable. The 125,000
    restricted shares were issued under an agreement dated
    May 6, 2003, as amended. Under the agreement, 52,082 of the
    shares are now vested, and the restrictions on the remaining
    72,918 shares will lapse on May 1, 2006. If
    Mr. Zucker’s employment is terminated by Midway for
    “cause” or by Mr. Zucker without “good
    reason,” as defined in the agreement, then Mr. Zucker
    will forfeit the shares for which the restrictions have not
    lapsed. If Mr. Zucker’s employment is terminated for
    any other reason, the restrictions will lapse in approximately
    equal quarterly installments until May 1, 2006. We employ Thomas E. Powell as Executive Vice
    President — Finance, Treasurer and Chief
    Financial Officer under the terms of an agreement dated
    March 21, 2001 as amended. His current base annual salary
    is $321,360, and he is eligible to receive a performance bonus
    in excess of 50% of his base salary. The agreement also provides
    for, among other things, full participation in all benefit plans
    and perquisites generally available to executive employees. In
    addition, pursuant to the terms of our agreement with
    Mr. Powell dated February 10, 2003, if a change of
    control occurs within five years from the date of the agreement,
    and within two years thereafter Mr. Powell’s
    employment is terminated (a) by Midway without cause,
    (b) by Mr. Powell due to the relocation of his office
    location more than 50 miles from its present location, or
    (c) by Mr. Powell due to his placement in a position
    of lesser stature or the assignment of duties at variance with
    his current duties, then Mr. Powell will receive
    24 months of severance payments at his then current salary
    rate. We employ Steven M. Allison as Senior Vice
    President — Marketing and Chief Marketing Officer
    under the terms of an agreement dated December 3, 2003. His
    current base annual salary is $290,000. The agreement also
    provides for, among other things, full participation in all
    benefit plans and perquisites generally available to executive
    employees. Under the agreement, if we terminate
    Mr. Allison’s employment without cause, we must pay
    him severance equal to six months’ salary. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with Miguel Iribarren
    dated February 10, 2003, if a change of control occurs
    within five years from the date of the agreement, and within two
    years thereafter Mr. Iribarren’s employment is
    terminated (a) by Midway without cause, (b) by
    Mr. Iribarren due to the relocation of his office location
    more than 50 miles from its present location, or
    (c) by Mr. Iribarren due to his placement in a
    position of lesser stature or the assignment of duties at
    variance with his current duties, then Mr. Iribarren will
    receive 18 months of severance payments at his then current
    salary rate. 21 Table of Contents Mark S. Beaumont, our former Senior Vice
    President — Entertainment, left Midway on
    August 19, 2005. We entered into a confidential settlement
    agreement and general release with Mr. Beaumont under which
    we will continue to pay him his annual base salary of $284,000
    through November 19, 2006, less usual payroll deductions.
    Under the agreement, until the earlier of November 30, 2006
    or such time as Mr. Beaumont is hired elsewhere by an
    employer that offers a health plan, and provided that he
    properly elects health insurance coverage under and pursuant to
    COBRA, we will pay the premium on Mr. Beaumont’s
    behalf for standard employee medical insurance, as well as
    provide him with continued participation in our Exec-U-Care
    supplemental health insurance program. In partial consideration
    for these benefits, Mr. Beaumont released and waived
    certain claims he may have against us. CERTAIN
    RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Relationship
    with Former Parent Company In 1996, Midway sold common stock in an initial public offering.
    After the offering, Midway’s parent company, WMS Industries
    Inc., continued to own 86.8% of Midway’s common stock until
    1998, when WMS distributed all of its remaining Midway stock to
    its stockholders (the “Spinoff”). WMS has not owned
    any Midway common stock since the Spinoff. One of our directors,
    Mr. Sheinfeld, is also a director of WMS. Until the Spinoff, Midway was a member of the consolidated group
    of corporations of which WMS was the common parent for federal
    income tax purposes. Therefore, Midway was jointly and severally
    liable for any federal tax liability of the WMS group for the
    period during which it was part of the WMS group. WMS and Midway
    entered into several agreements regarding the allocation of
    these tax liabilities between Midway and WMS. These agreements
    consisted of (w) a Tax Sharing Agreement dated July 1,
    1996; (x) a Tax Separation Agreement dated April 6,
    1998; (y) a Letter Agreement dated September 24, 2001;
    and (z) a Settlement Agreement dated August 11, 2003. On November 19, 2004, the parties terminated these
    agreements in settlement of a disagreement between them
    concerning the interpretation of the “change of
    control” provisions in the agreements relating to
    Mr. Redstone’s accumulation of a majority interest in
    Midway common stock. Under the terms of the settlement, all four
    tax agreements were terminated, and Midway paid to WMS the
    amount of $1,500,000. Additional details of the terms of the
    four agreements were as follows: The Tax Sharing Agreement provided a method for:
    (a) determining the amount that Midway must pay to WMS in
    respect of federal income taxes; (b) compensating any
    member of the WMS group for use of its net operating losses, tax
    credits and other tax benefits in arriving at the WMS group tax
    liability as determined under the federal consolidated return
    regulations; and (c) providing for the receipt of any
    refund arising from a carryback of net operating losses or tax
    credits from subsequent taxable years and for payments upon
    subsequent adjustments. The Tax Separation Agreement set forth the parties’
    respective liabilities for federal, state and local taxes, among
    other things, including: (a) the filing of tax returns with
    federal, state and local authorities; (b) the carryover of
    any tax benefits of Midway; (c) the treatment of the
    deduction attributable to the exercise of WMS stock options held
    by employees or former employees of Midway and any other similar
    compensation related tax deductions; (d) the treatment of
    net operating loss carrybacks; (e) the treatment of audit
    adjustments; and (f) procedures with respect to any claim
    made by any taxing authority with respect to a tax liability of
    Midway or any of its subsidiaries. Under the 2001 letter agreement, WMS paid $2.8 million to
    Midway relating to the exercise of WMS stock options by Midway
    employees after the Spinoff, because Midway’s original
    benefit was extinguished by Midway’s post-Spinoff net
    operating loss carryback to its post-Spinoff profitable years.
    Under the 2003 settlement agreement, WMS paid a
    $4.0 million advance to Midway because net operating loss
    carry-backs of WMS from post-Spinoff years to pre-Spinoff years
    prevented Midway from realizing tax benefits of carrying back
    its post-Spinoff net operating losses to pre-Spinoff years. The
    $2.8 million, and $3.7 million of the
    $4.0 million, were repayable by Midway under the agreements
    upon a “change of control” of Midway, among other
    circumstances. 22 Table of Contents Other
    Related Party Transactions William C. Bartholomay, a member of our Board of Directors, was
    President of Near North National Group, insurance brokers, which
    we retained to provide insurance brokerage services. Sumner M. Redstone, our controlling shareholder, is Chairman of
    the board and Chief Executive Officer of NAI. NAI is the parent
    company of both Viacom and CBS, a company spun off from Viacom
    late in 2005. Mr. Redstone also serves as Chairman of the
    Board for both Viacom and CBS. Midway has historically conducted
    business with Viacom and companies affiliated with Viacom and
    Mr. Redstone. Mr. Redstone also is a controlling
    stockholder of Sumco, a corporation to which he transferred
    approximately 41% of his shares of our common stock in December
    2005. During 2005, we announced a strategic relationship with MTV
    Networks, a subsidiary of Viacom, to jointly market three video
    game titles, and collaborate on soundtrack development for two
    of these titles. Under the terms of the agreement, MTV has the
    option to provide us with varying levels of marketing and
    promotional support for these video games. We may then include
    various agreed-upon MTV properties and trademarks within the
    respective video games. Also, we will be required to then pay to
    MTV varying levels of marketing and production costs based upon
    the amount of support provided by MTV, as well as royalties from
    game sales based upon the amount of support provided by MTV and
    the number of units sold and profitability of the game. L.A.
    RUSH, released in October 2005 on the PlayStation 2 and
    Xbox, was the first of the three titles to be released under the
    relationship. Selling and marketing purchases from MTV totaled
    $4,679,000 in 2005. No royalties were yet owed to MTV based upon
    game sales of L.A. RUSH in 2005. At December 31,
    2005, we had amounts outstanding of $362,000 due to MTV included
    in accounts payable. Selling and marketing expenses incurred from advertising
    purchases with other Viacom affiliates totaled $5,228,000 during
    the year ended December 31, 2005. We also had amounts
    outstanding of $877,000 due to other Viacom affiliates included
    in accounts payable at December 31, 2005. Two members of our Board of Directors also serve as directors
    for either NAI or companies that NAI controls. Shari E. Redstone
    (Mr. Redstone’s daughter) currently serves as
    President and a director of NAI, as well as vice chair of the
    board for both Viacom and CBS. Mr. Redstone also formed a
    new holding company late in 2005, Sumco, Inc., which is owned
    jointly by both NAI and Mr. Redstone. Ms. Redstone
    also serves as President of Sumco. Also, Joseph A.
    Califano, Jr., a member of our Board of Directors, serves
    as a director of CBS. Mr. Califano also served as a
    director of Viacom from 2003 until the split of Viacom and CBS
    in 2005. In addition, Robert J. Steele, a Board of Directors
    nominee, is the Vice President — Strategy and
    Corporate Development of NAI. PROPOSAL 2:
    APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
    FIRM We propose that the stockholders ratify the appointment by our
    Audit Committee of Ernst & Young LLP, independent
    registered public accounting firm, as our independent auditors
    for fiscal 2006, ending December 31, 2006. We expect that
    representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at
    the annual meeting and that they will be available to respond to
    appropriate questions submitted by stockholders at the meeting.
    Ernst & Young LLP will have the opportunity to make a
    statement at the meeting if they desire to do so. 23 Table of Contents Fees
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Ernst & Young LLP served as our independent registered
    public accounting firm for fiscal 2005 and 2004. Aggregate fees
    billed by Ernst & Young LLP for professional services
    rendered for the audit of fiscal years 2005 and 2004 and for
    other professional services billed in fiscal years 2005 and
    2004, were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Audit Fees(1) $ 1,212,747 $ 604,325 Audit-Related Fees(2) 40,710 18,000 Tax Fees 50,000 — All Other Fees — — Total $ 1,303,457 $ 622,325 (1) Comprised of the audit of our annual consolidated financial

    our Form 10-Qs and other services provided by the registered public accounting
    firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. (2) Comprised of 401(k) plan audit procedures and various other
    services. Pre-approval
    Policies and Procedures Consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission
    requirements regarding auditor independence, our Audit Committee
    has adopted a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible
    non-audit services provided by our independent auditor. Under
    the policy, the Audit Committee, or a designated member thereof,
    must pre-approve non-audit services prior to the commencement of
    the specified service. The approval by any member of the Audit
    Committee must be presented to the full Audit Committee at the
    next regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting. Our
    independent auditors verify to our Audit Committee annually that
    they have not performed and will not perform any prohibited
    non-audit services. Percentage
    of Services Approved Under S-X Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) None. The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of
    our common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to
    vote on this proposal is required for ratification of the
    selection of our independent registered public accounting firm.
    Ratification by the stockholders of the appointment of
    independent registered public accounting firm is not required,
    but the Board believes that it is desirable to submit this
    matter to the stockholders. If holders of a majority of our
    common stock present in person or by proxy did not approve the
    selection of Ernst & Young LLP at the meeting, the
    selection of the independent registered public accounting firm
    would be reconsidered. However, Mr. Redstone and
    Ms. Redstone have indicated to us that they will vote in
    favor of this proposal, so its passage is assured. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
    “FOR” THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF
    ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
    ACCOUNTING FIRM. AUDIT
    COMMITTEE REPORT The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Midway is
    composed of four independent directors and operates under a
    written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. On
    June 6, 2005, Mr. Harold Bach retired from the Audit
    Committee and Mr. Brown was elected to the committee. On
    March 30, 2006, upon the recommendation of the Audit
    Committee, the Board of Directors revised the Audit
    Committee’s charter, and a copy of the revised charter is
    included as Appendix A to this proxy statement. 24 Table of Contents Management is responsible for Midway’s internal accounting
    controls, assessing the effectiveness of internal controls over
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements.
    Midway’s independent registered public accounting firm,
    Ernst & Young LLP, are responsible for performing
    audits of (a) Midway’s consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with the auditing standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    (b) Midway’s internal control over financial
    reporting, and (c) management’s assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and
    issuing audit reports thereon. The Audit Committee’s
    responsibility is to monitor, review and oversee these processes. In keeping with that responsibility, the Audit Committee has
    reviewed and discussed Midway’s audited consolidated
    financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005,
    its internal control over financial reporting and
    management’s assessment thereof with both management and
    Midway’s independent registered public accounting firm. In
    addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent
    registered public accounting firm the matters required to be
    discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61,
    “Communications with Audit Committees.” The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written
    disclosures and the letter from the independent registered
    public accounting firm required by Independence Standards Board
    Standard No. 1, “Independence Discussions with Audit
    Committees,” and has discussed with the independent
    registered public accounting firm their independence. The Audit
    Committee has also considered whether the provision of non-audit
    services by the independent registered public accounting firm is
    consistent with maintaining auditor independence. Based on these discussions and reviews, the Audit Committee
    recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited
    consolidated financial statements be included in Midway’s
    Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors: Robert N. Waxman (Chairman) William C. Bartholomay Peter C. Brown Joseph A. Califano, Jr. OTHER
    MATTERS Stockholder
    Proposals As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board has not
    received notice of, and does not intend to propose, any other
    matters for stockholder action. However, if any other matters
    are properly brought before the meeting, it is intended that the
    persons voting the accompanying proxy will vote the shares
    represented by the proxy in accordance with their best judgment. We must receive any stockholder proposals of matters to be acted
    upon at our 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on or before
    December 26, 2006 to consider including them in our proxy
    materials for that meeting. If we do not receive notice of a
    stockholder proposal to be acted upon at our 2007 Annual Meeting
    of Stockholders on or before March 11, 2007, our proxy for
    that meeting may confer discretionary authority to vote on any
    such proposal. Further, if any stockholders wish to recommend
    nominations to be considered by our Nominating Committee prior
    to our 2007 annual meeting, such recommendations must be made
    following the procedures described above under “Nominating
    Committee Policies” and in Appendix B to this
    proxy statement. In order for a stockholder proposal or nomination to be acted
    upon at an annual meeting, notice of stockholder proposals must
    be delivered to us between 60 and 90 days prior to the
    annual meeting (or, if no public disclosure of the date of the
    meeting has been made at least 70 days before the meeting,
    then not more than ten days after such disclosure). The notice
    must contain the information required under Article I,
    Section 13 of our By-laws. 25 Table of Contents Section 16(a)
    Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
    requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more
    than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities,
    to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission. These persons are required
    by regulation to furnish us with copies of all
    Section 16(a) reports that they file. Based on our review
    of the copies of these reports received by us, or written
    representations from the reporting persons that no Form 5
    was required for those persons, we believe that, during fiscal
    2005, all filing requirements applicable to our officers,
    directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners were
    complied with. Voting
    Procedures We will appoint inspectors of election to tabulate the number of
    shares of common stock represented at the meeting in person or
    by proxy, to determine whether or not a quorum is present and to
    count all votes cast at the meeting. The inspectors of election
    will treat abstentions and broker non-votes as shares that are
    present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the
    presence of a quorum. Votes withheld in connection with the
    election of one or more of the nominees for director will not be
    counted in determining the votes cast and will have no effect on
    the outcome of the vote. With respect to the tabulation of votes
    cast on a specific proposal presented to the stockholders at the
    meeting, abstentions will be considered as present and entitled
    to vote with respect to that specific proposal, whereas broker
    non-votes will not be considered as present and entitled to vote
    with respect to that specific proposal. Therefore, abstentions
    will have the effect of a vote against each proposal, but broker
    non-votes will have no effect on the vote for or against each
    proposal. In addition, under New York Stock Exchange rules, with
    respect to any proposal that is a prerequisite to listing of
    additional or new securities, the total vote cast on the
    proposal must represent at least a majority of all outstanding
    shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the proposal.
    Since Mr. Redstone and his related parties control a
    majority of our outstanding voting shares, their vote will
    decide each proposal. The term “broker non-votes”
    commonly refers to shares held in street name for customers,
    where the broker does not have authority under New York Stock
    Exchange rules to vote on its own initiative on particular
    items, and the broker has not received instructions from the
    beneficial owners. At the annual meeting, brokers will have the
    authority to vote on both proposals. How to
    Obtain Our Annual Report on Form 10-K We will provide without charge a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, including
    financial statements and schedules, to each of our stockholders
    of record on April 24, 2006 and each beneficial owner of
    our common stock on that date, upon receipt of a written request
    mailed to our offices, 2704 West Roscoe Street, Chicago, IL
    60618, Attention: Geoffrey M. Mogilner,
    Director — Investor Relations. In the event that
    exhibits to the Forms 10-K are requested, a reasonable fee will be charged for reproduction
    of the exhibits. Please note that you can view and print our
    recent Forms 10-K, including exhibits, on our website at www.investor.midway.com or at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website
    at www.sec.gov. Requests from beneficial
    owners of common stock must set forth a good faith
    representation as to their ownership. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting in person, you
    are requested to mark, date, sign and return your proxy in the
    enclosed envelope. No postage need be affixed if mailed in the
    United States. You may revoke the proxy at any time before it is
    exercised. If you attend the meeting in person, you may withdraw
    the proxy and vote your own shares. By Order of the Board of Directors, DEBORAH K. FULTON Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel Chicago, Illinois April 28, 2006 26 Table of Contents APPENDIX A CHARTER
