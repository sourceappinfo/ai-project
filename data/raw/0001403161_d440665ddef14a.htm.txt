Table of Contents Table of Contents Stockholder Letter Visa has achieved strong results while operating with purpose, driving towards our goal of uplifting everyone, everywhere by being the best way to pay and be paid. Dear Fellow Stockholder, On behalf of the Board of Directors and the management team, we want to thank you for your investment in Visa and encourage you to vote your shares by proxy at this year’s Annual Meeting. Stockholder engagement remains a key input into Board discussions and decisions, and we greatly value the opportunity to maintain extensive year-round dialogue with our stockholders beyond the Annual Meeting. During 2023, we continued to capitalize on exciting opportunities in the industry and make great strides across our three growth levers: consumer payments, new flows, and value added services. Visa has achieved strong results while operating with purpose, driving towards our goal of uplifting everyone, everywhere by being the best way to pay and be paid. We are immensely proud of the progress Visa has made in the past year and are pleased to provide you with key updates on how the Board and management team continue to create value for our stockholders. Smooth leadership transition promotes continued innovation and growth A cornerstone of 2023 for Visa was the successful execution of our important leadership succession at the Board and management level, in which we effected a smooth CEO transition. After almost a year as Executive Chairman supporting the leadership transition, Al decided to retire from the Board as of the Annual Meeting. John Lundgren, currently our Lead Independent Director, will take on the Independent Board Chair role following our Annual Meeting. The Board is pleased with how its leadership structure has enabled collaboration with management and facilitated a successful leadership transition over the last year. During this time, we also welcomed Chris Suh to Visa as our new CFO. He assumed the role fully in August 2023 and has already contributed meaningfully to our team. We are excited about Visa’s future and the leadership in place to drive and oversee success, growth, and innovation. New independent director brings important experience in technology and cybersecurity In addition to our leadership transitions over the past year, the Board appointed Pam Murphy as an independent director, whose operational knowledge of global software and technology companies and direct experience leading a cybersecurity software and services company are additive to the Board’s active assessment and oversight of risk, particularly in the area of cybersecurity risk. Pam’s perspective has already been a valuable addition to Visa’s Board. Proposed amendments to certificate of incorporation beneficial to all Visa common stockholders Finally, we are pleased with the significant progress Visa has made resolving claims under the U.S. Covered Litigation, and after careful consideration of this progress and input from our common stockholders across all three classes, the Board has decided to propose amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation, which, if approved at this Annual Meeting, would authorize a Class B Exchange Offer Program. As detailed in Proposal 4, the Class B Exchange Offer Program certificate amendments would allow for a programmatic and measured release of portions of Class B shares. The Board believes the Certificate of Incorporation amendments will provide benefit to all of our Class A, Class B, and Class C common stockholders. Thank you for your continued support and engagement during 2023 as we, along with the rest of the Board, work to power sustainable commerce and economic growth around the world.

There are three primary principles that guide our compensation program design and administration: (1) pay for performance; (2) promote alignment with stakeholders’ interests; and (3) attract, motivate, and retain key talent. We tie a substantial portion of our NEOs’ target annual compensation to the achievement of pre-established financial and non-financial objectives that support our business strategy, with a mix that balances short- and long-term performance goals. Further, our annual incentive plan incorporates corporate responsibility and sustainability metrics that are tied to the Company’s strategic objectives. Our long-term equity awards align the interests of our NEOs with our stakeholders’ interests and link a substantial portion of compensation to the achievement of earnings per share (EPS) results that drive total shareholder return (TSR). For fiscal year 2023, 93% of the target total direct compensation of the annual compensation components for our Chief Executive Officer was variable and at-risk, and an average of 91% was variable and at-risk for our other NEOs. 4 Table of Contents Proxy Summary Principles of our Compensation Program Pay for Performance The key principle of our compensation philosophy is pay for performance. We favor variable “at-risk” pay opportunities over fixed pay, with a significant portion of our NEOs’ total compensation determined based on performance against annual and long-term goals and stockholder return. Promote Alignment with Stakeholders’ Interests We reward performance that meets or exceeds the goals that the Compensation Committee establishes with the objective of increasing stockholder value over time, aligning with other stakeholders’ interests, and driving long-term strategic outcomes, including the Company’s broader corporate responsibility and sustainability efforts. Attract, Motivate, and Retain Key Talent We design our compensation program to attract, motivate, and retain key talent.

We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. 2024 Proxy Statement 5 Table of Contents Proxy Summary Board’s Role In Long-Term Strategic Planning The Board takes an active role with management to formulate and review Visa’s long-term corporate strategy. Each quarter, the Board and management confer on the execution of our long-term strategic plans, and the status of key initiatives, opportunities, and risks facing Visa. In addition, the Board regularly conducts in-depth long-term strategic reviews with our senior management team. During these reviews, the Board and management discuss the payments landscape, emerging technological and competitive opportunities and threats, and short- and long-term plans and priorities within our strategy. Additionally, the Board annually discusses and approves budget and capital requests, which are firmly linked to Visa’s long-term strategic plans and priorities. Through these processes, the Board brings its collective, independent judgment to bear on the most critical long-term strategic issues facing Visa. For more information on our long-term strategy and the progress we made against our strategic goals in fiscal year 2023, please see our 2023 Annual Report, including the letter from our Chief Executive Officer, Ryan McInerney, to our stockholders. Talent and Human Capital Management Attracting, developing, and advancing the best people globally is crucial to all aspects of Visa’s activities and long-term success, and is central to our long-term strategy. Best-in-class, diverse teams and an inclusive culture inspire leadership, encourage innovative thinking, and support the development and advancement of all employees. Since September 2020, we have strategically grown our employee workforce by 41%. We have focused on hiring talent in key areas such as Value Added Services (VAS), New Flows, Product, and Technology, and we have made good progress to meet our underrepresented goals in the U.S. and to increase the percentage of women employees globally. To continue this momentum, we are evolving how we attract, hire, develop, and retain top talent. At Visa, all employees are encouraged and empowered to be leaders through embracing the Visa Leadership Principles. These Leadership Principles are integrated into core talent processes, and since their introduction six years ago they have enhanced how we evaluate performance and drive the company’s success. In fiscal year 2023, as we look ahead to the next chapter of Visa’s growth, we introduced evolved Leadership Principles, with the aim to drive clarity and specificity around the behaviors that will contribute to Visa’s future success, while building on our strengths: Lead Courageously Obsess about Customers Collaborate as One Visa Execute with Excellence Act like an owner Think big and challenge the status quo Hold ourselves and each other accountable Listen and learn from customers Dream, design, and build the future of payments Sell with pride and purpose Champion inclusion and diversity Encourage constructive debate Enable each other to succeed Decide quickly and move fast Deliver seamlessly Learn from our mistakes 6 Table of Contents Proxy Summary The tone and culture of Visa is set at the Board level. The full Board has oversight of human capital management and performs regular reviews, including annual reviews of succession planning for our Chief Executive Officer. Our Board committees have responsibility for specific areas of human capital management. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for director succession and refreshment, as well as management succession and development planning. Our Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing Visa’s programs and practices related to executive workforce inclusion and diversity as well as the administration of compensation programs in a non-discriminatory manner. Management is responsible for developing policies and processes that reflect and reinforce our desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. Employee Development and Engagement Visa understands that being an employer of choice requires best-in-class career and skills development along with innovative programs. Given Visa’s ambitious growth agenda and efforts to achieve our purpose, we have focused on enhancing our employees’ expertise across our business. This includes building a new Technology Apprenticeships program to help us broaden and strengthen our talent channels and pipelines. In fiscal year 2023, we developed the Visa Payments Learning Program to diversify entry paths into the workforce, with an initial focus on payments and cybersecurity. We also committed to providing employees with the tools they need to do their work more quickly and easily, including an artificial intelligence-driven portal with a searchable knowledge base to create customized results and bespoke solutions. We support employees in their development through our award-winning Visa University. Our global learning platform, Learning Hub, houses nearly 200,000 learning resources on a number of topics, including sales, technology, product, and leadership development. Visa’s annual Learning Festival includes courses taught and facilitated by Visa leaders and external speakers who bring real-world context and ideas for practical application that are aligned with our goals. In 2023, we created our new employee value proposition, Powering payments, uplifting people , which is closely linked to our purpose. Our employee value proposition has been embedded throughout numerous key organizational programs and processes, and has been used to help attract, develop, and advance top-notch talent. We recognize that building an inclusive and high-performing culture requires an engaged workforce, where employees are motivated to do their best work every day. Our engagement approach centers on communication and recognition. We communicate with our employees in a variety of ways, including quarterly town hall meetings, our company intranet, digital signage, email newsletters, and live events in regional offices. We also are dedicated to ensuring that employees feel valued in their day-to-day work. To provide employees with more opportunities to recognize and be recognized, we introduced UPLIFT, Visa’s new recognition platform, which enables peer-to-peer recognition and reinforces our employee value proposition and the Visa Leadership Principles. Employee engagement in peer recognition has significantly increased since the launch, with monthly active users reaching 78% in September 2023. With this enhanced platform, employees are encouraged to recognize each other in uplifting everyone, everywhere. We assess employee engagement through a variety of channels, including employee engagement surveys and periodic pulse surveys, which provide feedback on a variety of topics, such as company direction and strategy, wellbeing, inclusion and diversity, individual growth and development, collaboration, and confidence and pride. In Visa’s fiscal year 2023 employee engagement survey, 95% of employees reported that they feel proud to work for Visa, 92% of employees understand the link between their work and our company’s strategic objectives, and 91% of employees are proud to work for a purpose-driven company and would recommend Visa as a great place to work. 2024 Proxy Statement 7 Table of Contents Proxy Summary Employee Benefits We believe our employees are critical to the success of our business, and we structure our total rewards and benefits package to attract and retain a talented and engaged workforce.

Lundgren, Teri L. List, Ryan McInerney, Linda J. Rendle, Denise M. Morrison, and Alfred F.

The Board regularly monitors our corporate governance policies and profile to confirm we meet or exceed the requirements of applicable laws, regulations and rules, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We have instituted a variety of practices to foster and maintain responsible corporate governance, which are described in this section. To learn more about Visa’s corporate governance and to view our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and the charters of each of the Board’s committees, please visit the Investor Relations page of our website at investor.visa.com under “Corporate Governance.” Our Environmental, Social & Governance Report is located on our website at visa.com/esg . You may request a printed copy of any of these documents free of charge by contacting our Corporate Secretary at Visa Inc., P.O. Box 193243, San Francisco, CA 94119 or corporatesecretary@visa.com . Board Leadership Structure The Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines provide the Board with the flexibility to determine the appropriate leadership structure for the Company. In making leadership structure determinations, the Board considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business and what is in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders. The Board’s thoughtful consideration of its leadership structure given evolving needs of the Company and our operative environment is demonstrated by its recent decision to appoint an independent Board Chair following Al Kelly’s planned retirement from the Executive Chairman role, as detailed in the below sections. Current Leadership Structure As a part of the Chief Executive Officer succession process that culminated in February 2023, the Board made the determination to split the role of Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson at that time. The Board believes that this leadership structure is appropriate given Mr. Kelly’s and Mr. McInerney’s respective tenures and because it separates the leadership of the Board from the duties of day-to-day leadership of the Company. This structure has allowed our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. McInerney, to focus on the day-to-day management of the business and on executing our strategic priorities, while Mr. Kelly as Executive Chairman focused on leading the Board and providing advice and counsel to Mr. McInerney. In addition, the independent directors reaffirmed the Board’s commitment to strong independent board leadership by unanimously re-electing Mr. Lundgren as Lead Independent Director. Mr. Lundgren has significant experience as a former Chief Executive Officer of a 10 Table of Contents Corporate Governance publicly-traded company, and in building strong relationships with various constituencies. The Board believes that this leadership structure is effective, supports independent oversight, and currently serves the business and stockholders well. To further promote independent leadership, the Board developed a robust set of responsibilities for the Lead Independent Director role, including: • calling, setting the agenda for, and chairing periodic executive sessions and meetings of the independent directors; • chairing Board meetings in the absence of the Chairperson or when it is deemed appropriate arising from the Chairperson’s management role or non-independence; • providing feedback to the Chairperson and to the Chief Executive Officer on corporate and Board policies and strategies and acting as a liaison between the Board and the Chief Executive Officer; • facilitating communication among directors and between the Board and management; • in concert with the Chairperson and the Chief Executive Officer, advising on the agenda, schedule, and materials for Board meetings and strategic planning sessions based on input from directors; • coordinating with the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, leading the independent directors’ involvement in Chief Executive Officer succession planning, selection of committee chairs and committee membership, and the Board evaluation process; • coordinating with the Chair of the Compensation Committee to support the independent directors’ evaluation of Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman performance and compensation; • communicating with stockholders as necessary; and • carrying out such other duties as are requested by the independent directors, the Board, or any of its committees from time to time. In addition, independent directors chair each of the Board’s four standing committees: the Audit and Risk Committee, chaired by Lloyd A. Carney; the Compensation Committee, chaired by Denise M. Morrison; the Finance Committee, chaired by Maynard G. Webb, Jr.; and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, chaired by John F. Lundgren. In their capacities as independent committee chairs, Mr. Carney, Mr. Lundgren, Ms. Morrison, and Mr. Webb each have responsibilities that contribute to the Board’s independent oversight of management, as well as facilitating communication among the Board and management. Board Appoints Independent Board Chair The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board continue to periodically review the Board’s leadership structure and to exercise their discretion in recommending an appropriate and effective Board leadership framework on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the needs of the Board and the Company at such time. In October 2023, Mr. Kelly announced that he would not stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting and would resign as Executive Chairman at that time. As a result, the Board considered the Board’s leadership structure and upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, determined to elect Mr. Lundgren, the current Lead Independent Director, as Board Chair effective upon the election of directors at the Annual Meeting, subject to his re-election. The independent Board Chair will chair meetings of the Board and will also have the duties of the Lead Independent Director to the extent applicable. 2024 Proxy Statement 11 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Board of Directors and Committee Evaluations Our Board recognizes that a robust and constructive Board and committee evaluation process is an essential component of Board effectiveness. As such, our Board and each of its committees conduct an annual evaluation facilitated by an independent third party, which includes a qualitative assessment by each director of the performance of the Board and the committee or committees on which the director sits. The Board also conducts an annual peer review, which is designed to assess individual director performance. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in conjunction with the Lead Independent Director, oversees the evaluation process. Feedback Incorporated Over the past few years, the evaluation process has led to a broader scope of topics covered in Board meetings, improvements in Board process, and changes to Board and committee composition and structure. This year’s evaluation identified areas for continued focus, including: •  Board leadership structure and succession planning • Board refreshment and director skills; • streamlining meetings to optimize time for discussion; • management succession planning; and • long-term strategy. Director Succession Planning and Board Refreshment In addition to executive and management succession, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly oversees and plans for director succession and refreshment of the Board to cultivate a mix of skills, experience, tenure, and diversity that promotes and supports the Company’s long-term strategy. In doing so, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into consideration the overall needs, composition, and size of the Board, as well as the criteria adopted by the Board regarding director candidate qualifications, which are described in the section entitled Committees of the Board of Directors – Criteria for Nomination to the Board of Directors and Diversity . Individuals identified by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as qualified to become directors are then recommended to the Board for nomination or election. 12 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Board Refreshment Timeline Independence of Directors The NYSE’s listing standards and our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a majority of our Board and every member of the Audit and Risk, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees must be “independent.” Our Certificate of Incorporation further requires that at least 58% of our Board be independent. Of the Board nominees, 91% are independent. Under the NYSE’s listing standards, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and our Certificate of Incorporation, no director will be considered to be independent unless our Board affirmatively determines that such director has no direct or indirect material relationship with Visa or our management. Our Board reviews the independence of its members annually and has adopted guidelines to assist it in making its independence determinations, including categorical standards of director independence that describe certain relationships that are deemed to be not material when assessing director independence and therefore shall not disqualify any director or nominee from being considered independent. In the event a director or nominee has a relationship with the Company that is relevant to his or her independence and is not addressed by the categorical independence standards, the Board determines in their judgment whether such relationship is material. For details, see our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at investor.visa.com under “Corporate Governance.” In October 2023, with the assistance of legal counsel, our Board conducted its annual review of director independence taking into account the NYSE listing standards and our independence guidelines set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. As a result of its review, the Board (upon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) affirmatively determined that each of our non-employee directors (Lloyd A. Carney, Kermit R. Crawford, Francisco Javier Fernández-Carbajal, Ramon Laguarta, Teri L. List, John F. Lundgren, Denise M. Morrison, Pamela Murphy, Linda J. Rendle, and Maynard G. Webb, Jr.) is “independent” as that term is defined in the NYSE’s listing standards, our independence guidelines, and our Certificate of Incorporation. In addition, the Board previously determined that Mary B. Cranston and Robert W. Matschullat, who retired from the Board at our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, were “independent” while they served on the Board during fiscal year 2023. In addition, the Board determined that each member of the Audit and Risk Committee and the Compensation Committee meets the additional, heightened independence criteria applicable to such committee members under the NYSE rules. Executive Sessions of the Board of Directors The non-employee, independent members of our Board and all committees of the Board generally meet in executive session without management present during their Board and committee meetings. John F. Lundgren, our Lead Independent Director, presides over executive sessions of the Board, and the committee chairs, each of whom is independent, preside over executive sessions of the committees. 2024 Proxy Statement 13 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Limitation on Other Board and Audit Committee Service Through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board annually reviews the corporate governance guidelines which include limitations on directors’ ability to serve on the boards of other publicly-traded companies. In order to inform these limitations, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers many factors, including: • time commitment required by Visa in conjunction with Board and committee meeting attendance; • the scope of responsibilities of individual committees; • individual contributions at our Board and committee meetings, taking into account the director’s general engagement, effectiveness, and preparedness; • peer review feedback from directors throughout the year and the results of the annual Board evaluation; • whether the director is currently employed or retired from full-time employment; • the number of other boards of which the director is a member and the role of the directors on these board with consideration given to public company board leadership positions; • any industry or other commonalities between outside boards that aid in the director’s efficiencies serving on such boards; • input from our stockholders during engagement; and • the corporate governance guidelines adopted by our peers and other significant public companies. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines establish the following limits on our directors serving on publicly-traded company boards and audit committees: Director Category Limit on publicly- traded company board and committee service, including Visa All directors 4 boards Directors who are executives of a publicly-traded company 2 boards Directors who serve on our Audit and Risk Committee 3 audit committees The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may grant exceptions to the limits on a case-by-case basis after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the request. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that prior to accepting an invitation to serve on the board or audit committee of another publicly-traded company, a director should advise our Corporate Secretary of the invitation. The Corporate Secretary will review the matter with the Lead Independent Director or the Chair of the Board, the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and the Chief Executive Officer, so that the Board, through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, has the opportunity to review the director’s ability to continue to fulfill his or her responsibilities as a member of the Company’s Board or Audit and Risk Committee. When reviewing such a request, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers a number of factors, including the director’s other time commitments and leadership positions on boards, record of attendance at Board and committee meetings, potential conflicts of interest and other legal considerations, and the impact of the proposed directorship or audit committee service on the director’s availability. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducted a review of director commitments for our 2024 director nominees and affirms that all nominees are compliant with our board limit policy, with the exception of Ms. List as described in greater detail below, and believes that all directors currently have sufficient capacity to effectively serve as members of the Visa Board. Ms. List serves on three public company audit committees in addition to being a member of our Audit and Risk Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board considered Ms. List’s service on four public company audit committees, including her professional qualifications, former experience as a public company chief financial officer, and the nature of and time involved in her service on other boards. Following such review, the Board determined that such simultaneous service would not impair the ability of Ms. List to effectively serve on the Company’s Audit and Risk Committee and waived the limit for service on the Audit and Risk Committee for Ms. List. 14 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Management Development and Succession Planning Our Board believes that one of its primary responsibilities is to oversee the development and retention of executive talent so that an appropriate succession plan is in place for our Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management. Each quarter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets with our Vice Chair, Chief People and Corporate Affairs Officer and other executives to discuss management succession and development planning and to address potential vacancies in senior leadership. In addition, the Board annually reviews succession planning for our Chief Executive Officer. Following a robust succession planning process which included both internal and external candidates, on February 1, 2023, the Board appointed Ryan McInerney as Chief Executive Officer. Ryan is a seasoned leader in the payments and consumer banking industries with 20 years of experience delivering solutions to clients. He previously served as President of Visa, a role he held since 2013. In his role as President, Mr. McInerney was responsible for Visa’s global businesses, delivering value to Visa’s financial institutions, acquirers, merchants, and partners in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. He has overseen the company’s market teams, business units, product team, merchant team, and client services. The Board of Directors’ Role in Risk Oversight Our Board recognizes the importance of effective risk oversight in running a successful business and in fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities to Visa and its stockholders. While the Chief Executive Officer; Chief Risk Officer; General Counsel; Chief Financial Officer; Vice Chair, Chief People and Corporate Affairs Officer; President, Technology; Chief Information Security Officer; and other members of our senior leadership team are responsible for the day-to-day management of risk, our Board is responsible for promoting an appropriate culture of risk management within the Company and for setting the right “tone at the top,” overseeing our aggregate risk profile, and monitoring how the Company addresses specific risks, such as strategic and competitive risks, financial risks, brand and reputation risks, cybersecurity and technology risks, ecosystem risks, legal and compliance risks, regulatory risks, and operational risks. 2024 Proxy Statement 15 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Board of Directors • The Board exercises its oversight responsibility for risk both directly and through its standing committees. • Throughout the year, the Board and each committee spend a portion of their time reviewing and discussing specific risk topics. • On an annual basis, the Chief Risk Officer and other members of senior management report on our top enterprise risks, and the steps management has taken or will take to mitigate these risks. • Our President, Technology, provides regular updates to the Board on technology and cybersecurity, including an annual in-depth review. • Our General Counsel updates the Board regularly on material legal and regulatory matters. • Written reports also are provided to and discussed by the Board regularly regarding recent business, legal, regulatory, competitive, and other developments impacting the Company.

For example, in 2023, the Audit and Risk Committee met regularly with our Chief Risk Officer; General Counsel; Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer; Chief Financial Officer; Chief Auditor; and other members of senior management. Board Oversight of Cybersecurity Risk We are one of the world’s leaders in digital payments, and we facilitate global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies. As a result, we recognize that the cyber threat landscape continues to evolve, and we are committed to championing cybersecurity within our operations. 16 Table of Contents Corporate Governance We approach cybersecurity with a layered defense-in-depth strategy, which is supported by robust governance processes that involve regular oversight by and reporting to the Board and management. Specifically, the full Board receives updates on Visa’s cybersecurity program twice per year from our President of Technology. In addition, the Board’s Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for oversight of the company’s cybersecurity program, annually conducts an in-depth review of the Company’s cybersecurity program, and reviews any material changes to the information security strategy. The Audit and Risk Committee also receives quarterly reports from our Chief Information Security Officer on the state of Visa’s cybersecurity program, including relevant metrics and threat intelligence, as well as reports on internal audit findings concerning, and external assessments of, our cybersecurity program. Notably, in 2023, Visa’s security posture once again received the highest maturity rating issued by Gartner Consulting. More information on our cybersecurity program is available in our 2022 ESG report available at visa.com/esg . Stockholder Engagement Our Board and management team greatly value the opinions and feedback of our stockholders. We have proactive, ongoing engagement with our stockholders throughout the year focused on corporate governance, corporate responsibility and sustainability, and executive compensation, in addition to the ongoing dialogue among our stockholders and our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Investor Relations team on Visa’s financial and strategic performance. Our Lead Independent Director also met with investors to discuss corporate governance, corporate responsibility, and executive compensation matters. 2024 Proxy Statement 17 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Topics covered during our discussions with investors included: • leadership transition: • human capital management, including talent recruitment and retention; • our environmental sustainability and climate goals and progress, including our sustainability solutions; • Board composition, skills, and diversity; • Board risk oversight, including cybersecurity, data privacy, artificial intelligence, and brand and reputation; and • our executive compensation program and philosophy. A summary of the feedback we received was discussed and considered by the Board, and enhancements have been made to certain of our disclosures to improve transparency. 2023 Stockholder Engagement Regarding Class B Exchange Offer Program Amendments In addition to our robust year-round stockholder engagement, during the Fall of 2023 Visa undertook an extensive engagement process with stockholders of each class of Visa common stock specifically related to the potential Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments. Stockholder feedback received during this engagement effort was considered by management and the Board and helped inform the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments that are presented for stockholder approval at this Annual Meeting. For additional information regarding this engagement process and the Class B Exchange Offer Program, please see Proposal 4 – Approval and Adoption of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments. Communicating with the Board of Directors Our Board has adopted a process by which stockholders or other interested persons may communicate with the Board or any of its members. Stockholders and other interested parties may send communications in writing to any or all directors (including the Chair or the non-employee directors as a group) electronically to board@visa.com or by mail c/o our Corporate Secretary, Visa Inc., P.O.

The total number of meetings held by each committee is listed below, under Committees of the Board of Directors . It is our policy that all members of the Board should endeavor to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. All ten of our then directors attended the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders along with Mr. McInerney (who attended in his capacity as President and subsequently joined the Board in February 2023). 18 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Codes of Conduct and Ethics Our Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all directors, officers, employees, and contingent staff of the Company. This Code includes a supplemental Code of Ethics for Certain Executives and Financial Officers, which applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Chief People and Corporate Affairs Officer, General Counsel, and other senior financial officers, whom we refer to collectively as senior officers. These Codes require the senior officers to engage in honest and ethical conduct in performing their duties, provide guidelines for the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships, and provide mechanisms to report unethical conduct. Our senior officers are held accountable for their adherence to the Codes. If we amend or grant any waiver from a provision of our Codes for officers or directors, we will publicly disclose such amendment or waiver in accordance with and if required by applicable law, including by posting such amendment or waiver on our website at investor.visa.com within four business days. Political Engagement and Disclosure Public sector decisions significantly affect our business and industry, as well as the communities in which we operate. For this reason, we participate in the political process through regular engagement with government officials and policy-makers, by encouraging the civic involvement of our employees, and by contributing to candidates and political organizations where permitted by applicable law. We are committed to conducting these activities in a transparent manner that reflects responsible corporate citizenship and best serves the interests of our stockholders, employees, and other stakeholders. Additional information regarding our political activities and oversight may be found at usa.visa.com/about-visa/esg/operating-responsibly.html . Visa has a Political Participation, Lobbying and Contributions Policy (PPLC Policy) that prohibits our directors, officers, and employees from using Company resources to promote their personal political views, causes, or candidates, and specifies that the Company will not directly or indirectly reimburse any personal political contributions or expenses. Directors, officers, and employees also may not lobby government officials on the Company’s behalf absent the pre-approval of the Company’s Global Government Engagement department. As such, our lobbying and political spending seek to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders, and not the personal political preferences of our directors or executives. Under the PPLC Policy, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must pre-approve the use of corporate funds for political contributions, including contributions made to trade associations to support targeted political campaigns and contributions to organizations registered under Section 527 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to support political activities. The PPLC Policy further requires the Company to make reasonable efforts to obtain from U.S. trade associations whose annual membership dues exceed $25,000 the portion of such dues that are used for political contributions. This information must then be included in the semiannual contribution reports that are posted on our website. We endeavor to maintain a healthy and transparent relationship with governments around the world by communicating our views and concerns to elected officials and policy-makers. As an industry leader, we encounter challenges and opportunities on a wide range of policy matters. These issues may include regulations and policies on interchange fees, cybersecurity, data security, privacy, intellectual property, surcharging, payroll and prepaid cards, mobile payments, tax, international trade and market access, and financial inclusion, among others. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews our political contributions and lobbying expenditures on a semiannual basis, which includes information regarding memberships in, or payments to, tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation. Additional information on our political contributions and lobbying expenditures can be found on our website, including our semiannual contribution reports and links to our quarterly U.S. federal lobbying activities and expenditures reports. In 2023, the Center for Political Accountability assessed our disclosures for its annual Center for Political Accountability CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, and designated Visa a “Trendsetter” (the highest designation in the CPA-Zicklin Index) with a perfect score of 100 for the eighth consecutive year. 2024 Proxy Statement 19 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability We believe that as a trusted brand in payments, Visa has an opportunity and responsibility to contribute to a more inclusive, ethical, and sustainable world. As we work toward this goal, we are committed to managing the risks and opportunities that arise from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, providing transparency of our ESG performance, and enabling strong executive and Board oversight of our overall ESG strategy.

To do so, we continue to take an integrated approach to our ESG performance and transparency. • Materiality-based Strategy: In line with international ESG guidelines and corporate best practices, Visa conducts a biennial ESG materiality assessment, which enables us to monitor and reassess our approach to managing priority topics.

These responsibilities are incorporated into the charter for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which is available on the Investor Relations page of our website at investor.visa.com under “Corporate Governance – Committee Composition.” • Engagement: Understanding the views of Visa stakeholders supports our work across our business and ESG strategic priorities. We regularly engage with our stakeholders to help inform our ESG strategy, priorities, and actions. • Reporting: Visa is committed to providing transparency regarding our ESG approach and performance through various channels and platforms of ESG reporting.

Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions The Audit and Risk Committee has adopted a written Statement of Policy with respect to Related Person Transactions (Statement of Policy), governing any transaction, arrangement, or relationship between the Company and any related person where the related person had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Under the Statement of Policy, the Audit and Risk Committee reviews related person transactions and may approve or ratify them only if it is determined that they are in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. When reviewing a related person transaction, the Audit and Risk Committee may take into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances available to it, including: (i) the material terms and conditions of the transaction or transactions; (ii) the related person’s relationship to Visa; (iii) the related person’s interest in the transaction, including their position or relationship with, or ownership of, any entity that is a party to or has an interest in the transaction; (iv) the approximate dollar value of the transaction; (v) the availability from other sources of comparable products or services; and (vi) an assessment of whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to us from an unrelated third party. In the event we become aware of a related person transaction that was not previously approved or ratified under the Statement of Policy, the Audit and Risk Committee will evaluate all options available, including ratification, revision, or termination of the related person transaction. The Statement of Policy is intended to augment and work in conjunction with our other policies that include code of conduct or conflict of interest provisions, including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We engage in transactions, arrangements, and relationships with many other entities, including financial institutions and professional organizations, in the ordinary course of our business. Some of our directors, executive officers, greater than five percent stockholders, and their immediate family members, each a related person under the Statement of Policy, may be directors, officers, partners, employees, or stockholders of these entities. We carry out transactions with these entities on customary terms, and, in many instances, our directors and executive officers may not be aware of them. To our knowledge, since the beginning of fiscal year 2023, no related person has had a direct or indirect material interest in any of our business transactions or relationships. 24 Table of Contents Committees of the Board of Directors Report of the Audit and Risk Committee The Audit and Risk Committee, which is composed of independent directors, is responsible for monitoring and overseeing Visa’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. The functions of the Committee are described in greater detail in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter, adopted by the Board, which may be found on the Company’s website at investor.visa.com under “Corporate Governance – Committee Composition.” Visa’s management has the primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal financial controls, for preparing the financial statements, and for the public reporting process. KPMG LLP, Visa’s independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of the Company’s audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In this context, the Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. In addition, the Committee has discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee also has received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and the Committee has discussed the independence of KPMG with that firm. The Committee also has considered whether KPMG’s provision of non-audit services to the Company impairs the auditor’s independence, and concluded that KPMG is independent from the Committee, the Company, and the Company’s management. Based on the Committee’s review and discussions noted above, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In addition, during the last fiscal year, none of our executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or the compensation committee of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board or Compensation Committee. 26 Table of Contents Committees of the Board of Directors Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs The Compensation Committee annually considers potential risks to the Company when reviewing and approving our compensation program. We have designed our compensation program, including our incentive compensation plans, with specific features to address potential risks while rewarding employees for achieving long-term financial and strategic objectives through prudent business judgment and appropriate risk-taking. The following elements have been incorporated in our compensation program for executive officers: A Balanced Mix of Compensation Elements Multiple Performance Factors Long-Term Incentives • The compensation mix for our executive officers consists of salary, annual cash incentives, and long-term equity incentives, with a significant portion in equity awards that drive long-term performance. • Our incentive compensation plans use multiple pre-established performance goals, which encourage the achievement of objectives for the overall benefit of the Company and its stakeholders. • Our long-term incentives are equity-based and have a regular three-year vesting schedule to complement our annual cash-based incentives. • 50% of our annual equity award value is subject to performance conditions over a three-year period. Capped Incentive Awards Stock Ownership Guidelines Recoupment Policies • Annual incentive awards and performance share awards are capped at 200% of target for executive officers. • Our guidelines call for significant stock ownership, which aligns the interests of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our stakeholders. • In addition to mandatory recovery of certain incentive compensation paid to executive officers in the event of a material restatement, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), our Clawback Policy authorizes the Board to recover other incentive compensation paid to all current and former Executive Committee members and Section 16 officers, including time-based restricted stock units and stock options, in the event of a material restatement of the Company’s financial results due to fraud, intentional misconduct, or gross negligence of the individual. • Our equity award agreements also provide for forfeiture of equity-based awards in the event of specified detrimental activity in the absence of a restatement. Additionally, the Compensation Committee annually considers an assessment of compensation-related risks. Based on this assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation program does not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Visa. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee reviewed the key design elements of our compensation program in relation to industry “best practices” as presented by the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant, as well as the means of mitigating potential risks, such as through our internal controls and oversight by management and the Board. 2024 Proxy Statement 27 Table of Contents Committees of the Board of Directors Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has: • reviewed and discussed the section entitled Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management; and • based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section be included in this proxy statement.

As part of its assessment, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers members’ independence, as well members’ other time commitments and experience in the context of the needs of the Company and the Board. After an in-depth review of the candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends candidates to the Board in accordance with its charter, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and the criteria adopted by the Board regarding director candidate qualifications. After careful review and consideration, the Board nominates candidates for election, or re-election, at our annual meeting of stockholders. The Board may appoint a director to the Board during the year to serve until the next meeting of stockholders.

Stockholders who wish to nominate a person for election as a director at an annual meeting of stockholders must follow the procedure described under Other Information – Stockholder Nomination of Director Candidates and Other Stockholder Proposals for 2025 Annual Meeting of this proxy statement. For additional information regarding this process, please see our Bylaws. 30 Table of Contents Committees of the Board of Directors Criteria for Nomination to the Board of Directors and Diversity The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee applies the same standards in considering director candidates submitted by stockholders as it does in evaluating other candidates, including incumbent directors. The identification and selection of qualified directors is a complex and subjective process that requires consideration of many intangible factors and will be significantly influenced by the needs of the Board from time to time. As a result, there is no specific set of minimum qualifications, qualities, or skills that are necessary for a nominee to possess, other than those that are necessary to meet U.S. legal, regulatory, and NYSE listing requirements and the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Corporate Governance Guidelines, and charters of the Board’s committees. However, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board have identified the ten skills and qualifications listed below as important criteria for membership on the Board. Payments Technology Senior Leadership Public Company Boards Financial Global Markets Marketing & Brand Risk Government & Geo-Political Ecommerce & Mobile In addition to the above qualities, the Board, through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, strives to be a board that reflects the diversity of our key stakeholders around the world (clients, customers, employees, business partners, and stockholders). While the Board does not have a formal policy on diversity, the Board’s practice in assembling the Board is to have wide diversity in terms of business experiences, functional skills, gender, race, ethnicity, and cultural backgrounds. To support this objective, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee instructs any search firm that is engaged to identify director candidates to include women and candidates from underrepresented groups in the pool from which the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers director candidates. 2024 Proxy Statement 31 Table of Contents Committees of the Board of Directors Compensation of Non-Employee Directors We compensate non-employee directors for their service on the Board with a combination of cash and equity awards, the amounts of which are commensurate with their role and involvement, and consistent with peer company practices. In setting non-employee director compensation, we consider the significant amount of time our directors expend in fulfilling their duties as well as the skill level required of members of our Board. Mr. Kelly, our Executive Chairman, and Mr. McInerney, our Chief Executive Officer, do not receive additional compensation for their service as directors. The Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors, has the primary responsibility for reviewing and considering any revisions to our non-employee director compensation program. In July 2022, the Compensation Committee undertook its annual review of non-employee director compensation for fiscal year 2023, which included an analysis completed by its independent compensation consultant. As part of this analysis, the independent compensation consultant reviewed trends and data from the same peer companies used by the Compensation Committee in connection with its review of executive compensation. Pursuant to the review, and after considering the independent compensation consultant’s advice based on peer group data, the Compensation Committee recommended that the Board approve an increase in the grant date value of the annual equity award for non-employee directors from $225,000 to $235,000 for grants made on or after the date of the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. This increase to the equity grant date value improved the overall positioning within the peer group and balanced the mix between cash and equity compensation.

Highlights of our Non-Employee Director Compensation Program 32 Table of Contents Committees of the Board of Directors Annual Retainers Paid in Cash Non-employee directors receive an annual cash retainer for their service on the Board, as well as additional cash retainers if they serve as the Lead Independent Director, on a committee, or as the chair of a committee. The following table lists the annual cash retainer amounts in effect during fiscal year 2023. Type of Retainer Amount of Retainer Annual Board Membership $110,000 Lead Independent Director $90,000 Audit and Risk Committee Membership $20,000 Compensation Committee Membership $15,000 Finance Committee Membership $20,000 Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Membership $15,000 Audit and Risk Committee Chair $30,000 (in addition to member retainer) Compensation Committee Chair $25,000 (in addition to member retainer) Finance Committee Chair $30,000 (in addition to member retainer) Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair $20,000 (in addition to member retainer) U.S.-based directors may defer the payment of all or a portion of the cash retainer payments, as described below under Executive Compensation – Non-qualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2023 – Visa Directors Deferred Compensation Plan . All cash retainers are paid in quarterly installments unless a director elected to defer the payment. Directors are also reimbursed for customary expenses incurred while attending meetings of the Board and its committees. Equity Compensation Each non-employee director receives an annual equity grant under the Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and restated (2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan), which limits the total grant date value of equity grants that may be made to our non-employee directors to $500,000 in a single fiscal year. On January 24, 2023, the date of our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each non-employee director received a restricted stock unit grant determined by dividing $235,000 by the per share closing price of our Class A common stock on that date, rounded to the nearest whole share. Following the date of a non-employee director’s election or appointment to the Board on a date other than at an Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the director receives a prorated initial grant based on the partial year of Board service; similarly, departing non-employee directors who joined the Board prior to November 2017 receive a grant for the year of departure, which is prorated for any partial year of service, as applicable. Accordingly, Mr. Crawford, who was appointed to the Board on October 7, 2022, received a restricted stock unit grant determined by dividing $75,000 by the per share closing price of our Class A common stock on October 15, 2022, rounded to the nearest whole share, and Ms. Murphy, who was appointed to the Board on April 10, 2023, received a restricted stock unit grant determined by dividing $195,833 by the per share closing price of our Class A common stock on May 15, 2023, rounded to the nearest whole share. Ms. Cranston and Mr. Matschullat, who did not stand for re-election at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and both joined the Board prior to November 2017, each received a restricted stock unit grant determined by dividing $235,000 (representing the entire grant date value applicable to a full year of service for the year of departure) by the per share closing price of our Class A common stock on January 24, 2023, rounded to the nearest whole share. Restricted stock unit grants to all non-employee directors vest immediately upon grant. Directors may elect to defer settlement of all or a portion of their equity grants. 2024 Proxy Statement 33 Table of Contents Committees of the Board of Directors Stock Ownership Guidelines The stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors specify that each director should own shares of our common stock equal to five times the annual Board membership cash retainer. Equity interests that count toward satisfaction of the guidelines include shares owned outright by the director, shares jointly owned, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and any deferred restricted stock units. Directors have five years from the date they become a member of the Board to attain these ownership levels. Each non-employee director with at least five years of service on our Board currently meets or exceeds the ownership guidelines. We also have an insider trading policy that, among other things, prohibits directors from hedging the economic risk of their stock ownership or pledging their shares. Charitable Matching Gift Program Our non-employee directors may participate in the Board Charitable Matching Gift Program. Under this program, contributions to eligible non-profit organizations are matched by the Visa Foundation, up to a maximum of $15,000 per director per calendar year. Our U.S. non-employee directors may also participate in our Political Action Committee (PAC) Charitable Matching Program. Under this program, when non-employee directors contribute to the Visa PAC, Visa matches their contribution to a qualifying charity or charities the non-employee director selects, up to a maximum of $5,000 per director per calendar year.

Similar to the adjustments the prior year, this increase to the equity grant date value improved the overall positioning within the peer group and the mix between cash and equity in the director compensation program. The Compensation Committee also recommended that the Board approve an increase in the annual cash retainer for the Lead Independent Director from $90,000 to $100,000 and an increase in the annual cash retainer for the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee from $20,000 to $25,000, each effective October 1, 2023. The increase in the annual cash retainers and the grant date value of the annual non-employee director equity awards was based on peer group data and determined in consultation with the independent compensation consultant to reflect the time commitment and contributions expected of the positions. 2024 Proxy Statement 35 Table of Contents Proposal 1 Proposal 1 – Election of Directors Our Board currently consists of twelve directors. Eleven directors are nominated for election at our Annual Meeting, including ten independent directors and our Chief Executive Officer. The size of the Board is being decreased to eleven directors as of the election of directors at the Annual Meeting. Each director is elected to serve a one-year term, with all directors subject to annual election. Mr. Kelly announced in October 2023 that he would not stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting. The Board thanks him for his ten years of dedicated service to Visa.

The primary functions served by the search firm included identifying potential candidates who meet the key attributes, experience, and skills described under Committees of the Board of Directors – Criteria for Nomination to the Board of Directors and Diversity above, as well as compiling information regarding each candidate’s attributes, experience, skills, and independence and conveying the information to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

Proxies submitted to Visa cannot be voted at the Annual Meeting for nominees other than those nominees named in this proxy statement. However, if any director nominee is unable or unwilling to serve at the time of the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies may vote for a substitute nominee designated by the Board. Alternatively, the Board may reduce the size of the Board. Each nominee has consented to serve as a director if elected, and the Board does not believe that any nominee will be unwilling or unable to serve if elected as a director. Each director will hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.

Except as stated otherwise, references to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related tables refer to Mr. McInerney and Mr. Suh, respectively. Philosophy of our Compensation Program We tie a substantial portion of our NEOs’ overall target annual compensation to the achievement of pre-established financial and non-financial performance goals, which include ESG metrics. The Compensation Committee’s objectives are to balance short- and long-term performance criteria, as well as to recognize corporate, business, and individual achievements that impact all stakeholders. The primary principles that guide the compensation program design and administration are summarized below. Principles of our Compensation Program Pay for Performance The key principle of our compensation philosophy is pay for performance. We favor variable “at-risk” pay opportunities over fixed pay, with our NEOs’ total compensation determined based on performance measured against annual and long-term goals and stockholder return. Promote Alignment with Stakeholders’ Interests We reward performance that meets or exceeds goals that the Compensation Committee establishes with the objective of increasing stockholder value over time, aligning with other stakeholders’ interests, and driving long-term strategic outcomes, including the Company’s broader ESG efforts. Attract, Motivate, and Retain Key Talent We design our compensation program to attract, motivate, and retain key talent. 50 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Key Elements of our Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation Program Compensation Mix Long-Term Equity Incentive The pay mix charts above represent the components of the annual compensation program for our Chief Executive Officer and other NEOs, including the base salary used for annual incentive determinations after the end of fiscal year 2023. The CEO chart includes Mr. McInerney’s equity award granted in connection with his appointment to CEO because it is reflective of his overall compensation package as Chief Executive Officer. The Other NEOs chart does not include Mr. Suh, who joined in July 2023, or components of pay to other NEOs during fiscal year 2023 that are not considered a part of their typical annual compensation. For purposes of these charts, Mr. McInerney’s annual compensation is included under CEO and Mr. Kelly’s compensation is included under Other NEOs. Components of Executive Compensation Compensation Component Type of Pay Key Characteristics Purpose Annual Cash Compensation Base Salary Fixed Reviewed annually based on individual performance, market pay levels, and internal pay equity. Attracts, retains, and rewards NEOs by providing a fixed source of income to reflect experience, skills, and competencies. Annual Incentive Awards Cash Incentive Awards Performance- Based Variable cash compensation component based on performance against pre-established performance goals in four categories that are aligned with our corporate strategy: Financial; Client; Foundational; and Operational Excellence, Talent, & ESG. Focuses NEOs on our annual results and aligns NEOs’ interests with stakeholders’ interests by rewarding performance based on the achievement of pre-established, strategic annual goals. 2024 Proxy Statement 51 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Compensation Component Type of Pay Key Characteristics Purpose Long-term Incentive Awards Equity Granted in the Form of Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Shares Performance- Based Stock option and restricted stock unit awards vest annually over a three-year period. Performance shares vest after a three-year performance period. Aligns NEOs’ interests with stockholders’ interests by linking a substantial portion of each NEO’s compensation to stock performance and the achievement of long-term corporate performance and operational efficiency. Recognizes company and individual performance in grant date value determinations. Retains NEOs through multi-year vesting of equity awards and three-year performance periods, as applicable. Provides opportunities for stock ownership, which attracts and motivates our NEOs and promotes retention. Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Highlights Visa delivered another year of strong financial results in fiscal year 2023. The following table summarizes our key financial results for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, as reported. Please see the section entitled Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of our fiscal year 2023 financial results. Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2022 Change (1) Net Revenues Growth 11 % (1) 22 % (1) n/a GAAP Net Income (in millions, except percentage) $ 17,273 $ 14,957 15 % Non-GAAP Net Income (in millions, except percentage) (2) $ 18,280 $ 16,034 14 % GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 8.28 $ 7.00 18 % Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (2) $ 8.77 $ 7.50 17 % (1) Calculated over the comparable prior-year period and based on unrounded numbers. (2) Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 reflect results as reported in accordance with GAAP, excluding certain items that we believe were not representative of our continuing performance, as they were non-recurring or had no cash impact, and could distort our longer-term operating trends. For supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on November 15, 2023. Non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. When making its determination of the net revenues, net income, and earnings per share metrics, which were used as goals for the annual incentive plan and for performance share awards, the Compensation Committee made further adjustments as described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation – Selected Corporate Performance Goals and Results for Fiscal Year 2023 and Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Long-Term Incentive Compensation – Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards Granted in Fiscal Year 2023. Performance-Based Compensation for Fiscal Year 2023 A significant portion of our fiscal year 2023 NEO compensation program is variable and at-risk and ties compensation to pre-established performance conditions, as described below. Variable over Fixed Pay • For fiscal year 2023, 93% of the target total direct compensation of the annual compensation components for our Chief Executive Officer was performance-based and at-risk, and an average of 91% was performance based for our other NEOs. 52 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis • Each NEO’s performance-based compensation includes an annual cash incentive award and long-term performance shares. For the annual cash incentive, the target award value is established at the beginning of the fiscal year and the actual award amount is determined based on performance measured against pre-established goals at fiscal year-end. Performance shares provide the opportunity for shares to be earned after a three-year performance period based on the achievement of pre-established financial goals. The payouts for the annual cash incentive and performance shares are capped at 200% of target. Focus on Pre-Established Performance Metrics • For fiscal year 2023, the annual incentive plan included financial performance goals related to Net Revenues Growth, Net Income Growth, and EPS Growth, as described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation – Selected Corporate Performance Goals and Results for Fiscal Year 2023 . In this proxy statement, we refer to these metrics as Net Revenues Growth – VIP adjusted, Net Income Growth – VIP adjusted, and EPS Growth – VIP adjusted. Actual performance for the financial metrics in the annual incentive plan exceeded the performance goals established for the fiscal year. • Similar to our approach in prior years, the fiscal year 2023 annual incentive plan scorecard also included goals in the following three categories: Client; Foundational; and Operational Excellence, Talent, & ESG. These performance goals were designed to align with our strategic objectives, including ESG initiatives, as described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation – Selected Corporate Performance Goals and Results for Fiscal Year 2023 . After the end of the fiscal year, the Compensation Committee carefully considered the Company’s performance against each of the pre-established goals and evaluated the degree to which each goal was exceeded, met, or not achieved, as described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation – Selected Corporate Performance Goals and Results for Fiscal Year 2023 . Based on this analysis, as well as its review of each NEO’s individual performance, the Compensation Committee determined that the payout for the annual incentive plan would be 150% of each NEO’s target payout. • The performance shares granted to our NEOs are based on our average EPS result over the three separate years applicable to the particular performance share award and our cumulative relative TSR for the three-year period. In this proxy statement, we refer to the EPS metric as EPS – PS adjusted. Our fiscal year 2023 EPS – PS adjusted was between the target and maximum established for fiscal year 2023, resulting in a performance factor of 154.8% for the relevant portion of each award. • The performance shares previously awarded on November 19, 2020 completed their three-year performance period at the end of fiscal year 2023. Performance shares earned pursuant to these awards were based on EPS – PS adjusted for fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023 and our three-year relative TSR measured against the other companies in the S&P 500. As described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation – Long Term Incentive Compensation – Determination of Shares Earned for Performance Shares Previously Awarded on November 19, 2020, performance against the two metrics resulted in the vesting of 179.4% of the target number of performance shares subject to these awards. 2024 Proxy Statement 53 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Highlights of our Compensation Program 54 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Say-on-Pay At the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approximately 90% of the votes cast on the Company’s annual Say-on-Pay proposal supported our fiscal year 2022 NEO compensation program. In general, we believe these results represent investor support of our overall compensation philosophy and decisions. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee did not make any changes to the underlying structure of our executive compensation program for fiscal year 2023 directly as a result of the Say-on-Pay vote. Nevertheless, the Compensation Committee regularly reviews the compensation program to ensure it remains competitive and aligned with our stakeholders’ interests and the principles of the program. As discussed under Corporate Governance – Stockholder Engagement , we have proactive, ongoing engagement with our stockholders throughout the year related to a number of topics, including executive compensation. In calendar year 2023 we reached out to our top 75 stockholders, representing approximately 65% of our outstanding Class A common stock. Common questions we received about our executive compensation program related to our annual incentive design, including the scorecard approach and incorporation of ESG principles. Our annual incentive design is described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation – Annual Incentive Plan , including a discussion of how ESG goals are incorporated into the design and are a key component of the program. Setting Executive Compensation Compensation Committee and Management Our Compensation Committee, which consists solely of independent directors, is responsible for establishing and reviewing the overall compensation philosophy and program for our NEOs. As discussed in detail under Committees of the Board of Directors – Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs, when establishing the annual compensation program for our NEOs, the Compensation Committee takes into consideration the potential risks associated with the program and structures it to provide appropriate incentives without encouraging excessive risk taking. 2024 Proxy Statement 55 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Setting Performance Goals and Making Compensation Determinations Before End of Fiscal Year Beginning of Fiscal Year During Fiscal Year After End of Fiscal Year ● Compensation Committee begins with a review of our compensation program, including its design and components, and assesses our compensation levels and their competitiveness against our peer companies to determine if any changes should be made to the program for the next fiscal year. ● Compensation Committee determines the principal components of compensation for the NEOs and the individual performance goals of the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Chairman and sets the performance goals for each performance-based compensation component. ● Chief Executive Officer sets individual performance goals for each of the other NEOs (except the Executive Chairman), which are reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The individual performance goals are designed to further drive our corporate goals and strategic objectives while holding the NEOs accountable for their performance. ● In fiscal year 2023, the Compensation Committee reviewed updated performance goals for the Chief Executive Officer and other NEOs in connection with their updated responsibilities following the appointment of Mr. McInerney as Chief Executive Officer. ● Compensation Committee meets regularly throughout the year, with management and in executive session, and reviews the Company’s performance to date against the corporate performance goals. ● The Compensation Committee also reviews the executive compensation program to ensure that it remains competitive and aligned with our stakeholders’ interests and the other principles of the program. The Compensation Committee’s independent consultant generally attends all committee meetings. ● Compensation Committee conducts a multi-part review of each NEO’s and the Company’s performance for the preceding fiscal year measured against the pre-established performance goals and makes annual compensation determinations. The Compensation Committee’s objective is to ensure that the level of compensation approved is consistent with the level of performance delivered. ● Our Chief Executive Officer reviews the performance of each NEO (other than his own and the Executive Chairman’s performance, which are reviewed by the Compensation Committee and the other independent directors) and presents his compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee. ● Compensation Committee reviews the compensation recommendations relating to NEOs that were made by our Chief Executive Officer and approves all compensation decisions for our NEOs based on its assessment of each NEO’s performance. ● For their own performance reviews, the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Chairman each prepare a self-assessment, which is reviewed by each independent director and discussed by the Compensation Committee and the other independent directors of the Board. When making compensation decisions for our Chief Executive Officer, Executive Chairman, and other NEOs, the Compensation Committee considers the views of the other independent directors. Role of Independent Consultant Our Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain and replace compensation consultants to provide it with independent advice. The Compensation Committee has engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (Meridian) as its independent consultant to advise it on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. This selection was made without the influence of management. Under the terms of its agreement with the Compensation Committee, Meridian does not provide any other services to the Company, unless directed to do so by the Compensation Committee and within the scope of the Compensation Committee’s charter. During fiscal year 2023, Meridian provided no services to the Company other than to advise the Compensation Committee on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. In addition, at the start of fiscal year 2023, the Compensation Committee conducted a formal evaluation of the independence of Meridian, and based on this review, did not identify any actual or potential conflict of interest raised by the work performed by Meridian. When conducting this evaluation, the Compensation Committee took into consideration the factors set forth in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rule 10C-1 and the NYSE’s listing standards. 56 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Compensation Peer Group As part of its annual compensation review process, the Compensation Committee discussed with its independent consultant an analysis of our fiscal year 2023 executive compensation program, including total compensation and the elements used to compensate our NEOs. It then compared their compensation to that of similarly situated NEOs of other companies in our compensation peer group. The review was based on public compensation data for our compensation peer group and data from third-party compensation surveys. To best inform their pay decisions based on where the Company competes for talent, the Compensation Committee has established two categories for identifying peer companies: • Direct business competitors. • Related-industry competitors that are S&P 500 companies (a) classified as financial services, technology excluding hardware and manufacturing, and interactive media/entertainment; (b) with a 12-month average market capitalization value between approximately one-fourth and four times Visa’s average market capitalization; and (c) with annual revenues of less than $150 billion. Certain peer companies may fall outside of these guidelines if they are determined to be a relevant market competitor for NEO talent. A list of 23 companies identified as peers for fiscal year 2023 is shown below. Related Industry Peers Direct Peers Financial Services Technology & Interactive Media/Entertainment • American Express Company • Discover Financial Services • Mastercard Incorporated • PayPal Holdings, Inc. • Bank of America Corporation • BlackRock, Inc. • Capital One Financial Corporation • Citigroup Inc. • JPMorgan Chase & Co. • Morgan Stanley • The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. • The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. • U.S. Bancorp • Wells Fargo & Company • Accenture plc • Adobe Inc. • Alphabet Inc. • Block, Inc. • IBM Corporation • Meta Platforms, Inc. • Microsoft Corporation • Oracle Corporation • salesforce.com, inc. In July 2023, using the methodology described above, the Compensation Committee reviewed the peer companies and added Intuit Inc. and removed Capital One Financial Corporation, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., and U.S. Bancorp from the list of peer companies for fiscal year 2024 and for compensation decisions at the end of fiscal year 2023. Use of Market Data To attract and retain key executives, we consider total compensation for our NEOs by reference to the range of compensation paid to similarly situated executives of our compensation peer group. This includes salary, annual incentive targets, and long-term incentive grant values. The actual level of our NEOs’ total direct compensation is determined based on both individual and corporate performance and can vary based on such factors as expertise, performance, or advancement potential. Internal Equity and Tally Sheets As part of its annual compensation review, the Compensation Committee compares our NEOs’ target annual compensation levels to ensure that they are internally equitable. The Compensation Committee also regularly reviews tally sheets for each NEO to ensure that it is considering a complete assessment of all compensation and benefits. The tally sheets include the aggregate amount of equity awards and other compensation values accumulated by each NEO and potential payments upon termination of employment both related and unrelated to a change of control. 2024 Proxy Statement 57 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation Base Salary When setting our NEOs’ base salaries, the Compensation Committee generally considers the range of compensation paid to similarly situated executive officers of our compensation peer group. The Compensation Committee may set salaries relative to this range based on considerations including the expertise, performance, or advancement potential of each NEO, including relative to other NEOs. The base salary levels of our NEOs typically are considered annually as part of our performance review process, and upon an NEO’s promotion or other change in job responsibilities. During its annual review of the base salaries of our NEOs for fiscal year 2023, the Compensation Committee considered market data for our compensation peer group; an internal review of each NEO’s compensation, both individually and relative to other NEOs; and the individual performance of each NEO. Based on this review, and in consultation with its independent consultant, the Compensation Committee decided to increase certain NEOs’ base salaries, as follows: Mr. McInerney’s base salary from $1,100,000 to $1,300,000; Mr. Fabara’s base salary from $750,000 to $800,000; Mr. Taneja’s base salary from $1,100,000 to $1,200,000; and Ms. Mahon Tullier’s base salary from $850,000 to $900,000. These changes were made during the annual compensation review process, prior to the announcement of Mr. McInerney’s appointment to Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Kelly’s and Mr. Prabhu’s base salaries did not change at this time. Subsequent to the ordinary course annual salary increases described in the preceding paragraph, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. McInerney’s base salary from $1,300,000 to $1,400,000 effective February 1, 2023, in connection with his appointment to the role of Chief Executive Officer, and decreased Mr. Kelly’s base salary from $1,550,000 to $1,250,000, effective February 1, 2023, in connection with his appointment to the role of Executive Chairman and the transition of the Chief Executive Officer role and responsibilities to Mr. McInerney. The Compensation Committee also set Mr. Suh’s base salary at $900,000 effective upon his start date. Similar to the annual review of base salaries for NEOs, the Compensation Committee considered market data for our compensation peer group and the advice of its independent compensation consultant when making these base salary decisions. Annual Incentive Plan Incentive Plan Target Award Percentage During fiscal year 2023, each of our NEOs was eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award under the Visa Inc. Incentive Plan (VIP). Each NEO’s target award was expressed as a percentage of his or her base salary, reflecting market practice, internal equity among executive officers, and the intended value and mix of target total direct compensation. After the end of the fiscal year, the Compensation Committee determined the amount of each NEO’s actual annual incentive award based upon its evaluation of achievement against pre-determined goals, with a maximum opportunity of 200% of the target percentage attributable to each NEO. Mr. Suh’s annual incentive was pro-rated for the portion of fiscal year 2023 he was employed with Visa. 58 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Selected Corporate Performance Goals and Results for Fiscal Year 2023 The Compensation Committee approved an annual incentive scorecard for fiscal year 2023, similar to the approach it has used since fiscal year 2021. The scorecard balances annual incentive determinations across financial and non-financial strategic priorities, with rigorous, pre-established quantitative and qualitative corporate performance goals in four categories. The Compensation Committee established the goals early in the fiscal year, reviewed progress against each goal quarterly, and evaluated achievement of the goals at year-end. The Compensation Committee determined a payout percentage based on its evaluation of results against the scorecard and then reviewed each NEO’s individual performance against his or her annual goals to determine whether any further adjustments should be made based on individual performance. These scorecard performance goals were established by reference to our corporate strategy, which is designed to position the Company competitively and thereby deliver superior performance, and which should in turn create value for our stockholders and benefit our employees, clients, and the communities in which we operate. The Compensation Committee expects our NEOs to be focused on a wide range of performance goals that are critical to our corporate strategy, by promoting financial goals along with other priorities that are vital to the Company’s long-term success, such as ESG initiatives. This approach is aligned with our corporate strategy, enhances stockholder value, and reduces the likelihood of excessive risk taking with respect to a particular financial performance goal. Accordingly, the scorecard design takes a holistic approach to the goal-setting process and does not apply specific weighting to the corporate performance goals described below, and the Compensation Committee carefully considered each goal and applicable results in its overall evaluation of corporate performance. The same scorecard is also used for determining the annual bonus funding for our broad-based employee bonus plan. Each of the performance goals for the annual incentive plan scorecard was established on November 2, 2022, except that certain preliminary goals were finalized on January 23, 2023. The performance goals were established based on the best available information at the time, designed to be challenging, and expected to incentivize the NEOs to advance Visa’s strategic and operational priorities during the fiscal year. The following table lists selected metrics from the annual incentive scorecard for fiscal year 2023. Financials, Clients, and Foundational Goals Selected Metrics Designed to promote strong financial results and align our NEOs’ interests with the interests of stockholders; develop and enhance Visa’s relationships with clients; and support key business priorities • Net Revenues Growth • Net Income Growth • EPS Growth • Payments Transactions Growth • Payments Volume Growth • Cross-Border Volume Growth • New Payment Flows • Net New Acceptance Locations Operational Excellence, Talent, and ESG Goals Selected Metrics Designed to ensure that our NEOs enhance the wellbeing of our employees, clients, and the communities in which we operate, and to advance our ESG strategy • Sustainability • Social Impact • Talent • Technology • Cybersecurity • Risk • M&A Integration Following the end of fiscal year 2023, the Compensation Committee evaluated the Company’s performance relative to each goal in the annual incentive scorecard. The following tables provide detail on many of the goals and achievements that the Compensation Committee considered to be important drivers of the Company’s success when making its annual incentive determinations for the NEOs. These goals and results represent a range of factors that demonstrate the value delivered by our NEOs to stockholders, our employees, clients, and the communities in which we operate. To maximize transparency into the goal-setting process while balancing concerns that disclosure of some operational goals would provide our competitors with insight into specific business priorities and initiatives, not all metrics, goals, and results are described in detail. 2024 Proxy Statement 59 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Financials, Clients, and Foundational • Net Revenues Growth – VIP adjusted of 11.4%, exceeding the annual goal of 9.3% • Net Income Growth – VIP adjusted of 13.8%, exceeding the annual goal of 8.2% • EPS Growth – VIP adjusted of 16.6%, exceeding the annual goal of 11.0% • Payments Transactions Growth of 7.7%, falling below the annual goal of 8.1% • Constant-dollar Payments Volume Growth of 9%, falling below the annual goal of 11% • Constant-dollar Cross-border Volume Growth excluding Intra-Europe of 25%, meeting the annual goal • Net New Acceptance Locations excluding China of 20 million, exceeding the annual goal Operational Excellence, Talent, & ESG • Exceeded our goals related to protecting the Company from cyber threats; ensuring cyber preparedness for acquired entities; innovating on cyber capabilities for the Company and ecosystem to further advance our leadership position; and ensuring compliance with regulatory reviews • Exceeded our goals related to building, deploying, and automating a risk technology platform that protects the Company and the payments ecosystem; advancing risk management capabilities to ensure that the Company maintains a strong control environment; developing new solutions to reduce risk and crime while driving strong client engagement and satisfaction; and continuing to provide tools and capabilities to monitor and minimize fraud in the payments ecosystem • Exceeded our technology goals for authorization, clearing, and settlement processing success rates, while enabling our product innovation priorities by delivering programs within scope, schedule, and budget and continuing our multi-year strategic transformation of Visa technology • Met our goal of successfully integrating Currencycloud and Tink and delivering on Tink’s business strategy • Exceeded our goal of digitally enabling 19 million SMBs worldwide in fiscal year 2023 as part of our three-year goal of digitally enabling 50 million SMBs • Met our goal of maintaining 100% renewable electricity and carbon neutral operations and our goals of advancing on our aspiration of being a climate positive company • Exceeded our goal of 25% of our employees volunteering in charitable opportunities, with 32% of our employees participating in such programs • Met our goal of continuing to advance the Visa Foundation as a key pillar in fulfilling Visa’s corporate purpose • Met our goal of increasing the number of underrepresented employees in the U.S. and continued our efforts to improve representation of women globally • Met our goals of improving the employee experience through a new employee value proposition and refreshed recognition strategy; rolling out a new hybrid work model; investing in talent attraction initiatives; and enhancing our employee retention, development, training, and total rewards strategies For purposes of the annual incentive plan, our Net Revenues Growth – VIP adjusted for fiscal year 2023 was determined as year-over-year growth in net revenues, adjusted to exclude pre-established adjustments made in accordance with the terms of the annual incentive plan determined at the beginning of fiscal year 2023. Our Net Income Growth – VIP adjusted was determined by adjusting our GAAP Net Income to exclude certain items that we believe were not representative of our continuing performance, as they were non-recurring or had no cash impact, and could distort our longer-term operating trends, as well as other pre-established adjustments made in accordance with the terms of the annual incentive plan determined at the beginning of fiscal year 2023. 60 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Individual Performance for Fiscal Year 2023 In addition to its review of the Company’s overall results relative to each goal in the annual incentive scorecard and its determination of the appropriate payout percentage to reflect these results, the Compensation Committee also evaluated each NEO’s individual performance, based on each NEO’s self-assessment, Mr. McInerney’s input, and input from the other non-employee directors with respect to Mr. McInerney and Mr. Kelly. Individual performance goals for the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman were established with the oversight of the Compensation Committee, and the Compensation Committee reviewed individual performance goals for the other NEOs. The following is a summary description of each NEO’s individual performance achievements for fiscal year 2023. Mr. McInerney • Delivered strong financial results, including 11% growth in revenue, 15% net income, and 18% EPS • Delivered exceptional performance with clients and partners around the world, deepening existing relationships and successfully building new strategic partnerships with players across the ecosystem • Successfully transitioned into role of CEO, ensuring minimal disruption to employees, clients, and investors • Continued to enhance senior talent, onboarding a new CFO and working closely with direct reports as many took on new and expanded responsibilities • Drove strong employee engagement Mr. Kelly • Successfully transitioned to role of Executive Chairman, ensuring a smooth CEO transition with minimal disruption to employees, clients, and investors • Provided excellent management of the Board in his role as Executive Chairman, including playing a significant role in creating a succession plan and ensuring a smooth transition of the Board Chair role to Mr. Lundgren • Effectively represented Visa in external forums including the Business Roundtable, media opportunities, and extensive engagement with governments and clients around the world • Supported Visa University by hosting informational sessions about career development for employees • Continued to Chair the Visa Foundation, delivering robust results and impact across the Foundation’s key priorities • Supported Mr. McInerney and other senior leaders as they transitioned into new and expanded leadership roles Mr. Suh • Successfully onboarded into CFO role • Managed strong financial close to the fiscal year, including budget process and fourth quarter earnings cycle • Brought to Visa deep experience in finance and technology, plus leadership in growing and scaling businesses Mr. Prabhu • Exceeded goals on all financial metrics • Managed spend and investment management amidst significant economic uncertainty, balancing investment in long-term priorities with prudent expense management • Delivered strong stockholder engagement • Supported successful CFO transition, ensuring seamless operations and onboarding of Mr. Suh 2024 Proxy Statement 61 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Mr. Fabara • Successfully managed Visa’s ecosystem risk, including driving efforts to identify fraud before it happens by deploying enhanced risk tools and capabilities • Delivered strong risk, control, and compliance environment and regularly engaged with regulators around the world • Deepened relationships with clients by launching revenue-generating risk services • Took on added responsibility for the Client Services organization, managing a seamless leadership transition and exceeding all key metrics on revenue and service levels Mr. Taneja • Successfully maintained Visa’s effective and robust security posture • Delivered strong operational excellence through availability, reliability, and resilience of core systems • Drove engineering and product development efforts across core products, new flows, and VAS • Played a critical role in pioneering Visa’s latest efforts around Generative AI • Supported Product and Technology transformation efforts by continuing to deepen alignment of product development to Visa’s business strategy Ms. Mahon Tullier • Delivered strong management of Board and stockholder engagement • Successfully met talent goals and drove meaningful improvements across the People function during a year of significant change • Revamped Visa’s talent strategy by developing robust programs designed to drive Visa’s future growth • Took on responsibility for Corporate Affairs function, including leading the Government Engagement, Transformation, and Inclusive Impact and Sustainability teams • Played a critical role in managing all aspects of our organizational transition Payment of Annual Incentive Plan Awards for Fiscal Year 2023 Based on its analysis of Visa’s performance relative to each annual incentive scorecard goal, the Compensation Committee determined that the payout percentage for the 2023 annual incentive plan would be 150% of target and that it would not adjust this payout percentage for any NEO based on its evaluation of the individual achievements described above. The Compensation Committee determined that this payout percentage appropriately reflected, in the aggregate, the Company’s and each NEO’s performance relative to the pre-established goals. The fiscal year 2023 annual cash incentive award payments are included in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the Executive Compensation – Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2023 and are set forth in the following table.

(3) In connection with his appointment to the role of Executive Chairman effective February 1, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved a decrease in Mr. Kelly’s base salary from $1,550,000 to $1,250,000, with the applicable salaries pro-rated for the portion of the 2023 fiscal year that Mr. Kelly served in the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman roles. Long-Term Incentive Compensation The 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan is intended to promote our long-term success by attracting, motivating, and retaining our non-employee directors, officers, and employees. The Compensation Committee administers the equity incentive plan with respect to our NEOs and determines, in its informed judgment and in accordance with the terms of the equity incentive plan, the recipients who may be granted awards, the form and amount of awards, the terms and conditions of awards (including vesting and forfeiture conditions), the timing of awards, and the form and content of award agreements. Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards Granted in Fiscal Year 2023 In determining the types and amounts of annual equity awards to be granted to our NEOs in fiscal year 2023, the Compensation Committee considered, in consultation with its independent consultant, factors including the practices of companies in our compensation peer group; the actual compensation levels of similarly situated executive officers of companies in our compensation peer group; company and individual performance; recommendations for awards to the NEOs other than himself from Mr. Kelly, who was our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the time of the annual grant determinations; and each NEO’s total compensation, including the value of outstanding awards held by each NEO. The Compensation Committee also considered the effectiveness of incentives provided by different award types, including increasing stockholder value, avoiding excessive risk taking, and encouraging employee retention. The target value of annual equity awards granted to each NEO in fiscal year 2023 consisted of 25% stock options, 25% restricted stock units, and 50% performance shares. Each award type is used to retain and incentivize key executive officers. Stock options generate value only if Visa’s stock price appreciates after the grant date, and performance shares are designed so that the number of shares that are earned varies based on corporate performance results. The following table displays the total combined target value of annual equity awards approved by the Compensation Committee for our NEOs in November 2022, and the award value broken down by component. The values in the table below differ from the values included for such awards in the Executive Compensation – Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2023 and the Executive Compensation – Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2023 Table because the aggregate grant date fair values of the performance shares displayed in those tables are computed in accordance with stock-based accounting rules and will be displayed in tranches over multiple years. In addition, certain other equity awards were granted to some of our NEOs in fiscal year 2023, as described below under the heading “ Long-Term Incentive Awards in Connection with Role Expansions .” Components of annual equity awards granted on November 19, 2022 Grant Date Value of Stock Options ($) Grant Date Value of Restricted Stock Units ($) Grant Date Value of Performance Shares at Target ($) Total Combined Grant Date Value of Annual Equity Awards ($) Ryan McInerney 3,375,000 3,375,000 6,750,000 13,500,000 Alfred F.

The stock options and restricted stock units vest in three substantially equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment through each such vesting date. Dividend equivalents on restricted stock units are paid in cash in an amount equal to dividends paid to holders of our Class A common stock. Performance Shares The value displayed for performance shares in the table above reflects the target value of the annual award. The target number of performance shares is determined at the beginning of a three-year performance period and the number of shares earned after the three-year period will range from zero to 200% of target depending on our corporate performance, as measured by: • the annual EPS goal established for each fiscal year; and • an overall modifier based on Visa’s TSR ranked relative to S&P 500 companies, or relative TSR Rank, over the three-year performance period. Vesting of the performance shares is generally subject to each NEO’s continued employment through the entire three-year performance period, except upon death, disability, retirement, involuntary terminations without cause, and certain qualifying (double-trigger) terminations in connection with a change in control, as described in the section titled Executive Compensation – Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control . We set EPS goals annually and average the results over three fiscal years to ensure that the goals are meaningful and the EPS results relative to the goals are not disproportionately impacted by unforeseeable market factors outside the NEOs’ control over a multi-year period. This approach provides a performance and retention incentive over the long term with three-year cliff vesting, while also including a modifier based on three-year relative TSR performance. FY2023-FY2025 Performance Share Design Impact of Stock Repurchases on EPS The amount of stock repurchases is budgeted at the beginning of the year. If Visa repurchased stock significantly above or below this level, the EPS result would be adjusted accordingly. Relative TSR Modifier The relative TSR modifier will reduce by up to 25% the number of shares that are earned for periods when our TSR performance is below the median of the companies comprising the S&P 500 and will increase by up to 25% the number of shares that are earned for periods when our TSR performance exceeds the median of the companies comprising the S&P 500. The total number of shares that may be earned at the end of the three-year period is capped at 200% of the target number of shares. 64 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis EPS Goals One-third of the target performance shares awarded on November 19, 2022, was tied to the fiscal year 2023 EPS goal that the Compensation Committee established within the first 90 days of fiscal year 2023. The remaining two-thirds of the target shares awarded is tied to the EPS goals for each of fiscal years 2024 and 2025, which will be set by the Compensation Committee within the first 90 days of the respective fiscal year. The actual EPS result will be used to determine the percentage of target shares credited from each of the three award tranches. If the minimum EPS goal is reached in a particular year, 50% of the target shares will be credited for that segment; if the target EPS goal is reached, 100% of the target shares will be credited; and if the maximum EPS goal is reached, 200% of the target shares will be credited. Results are interpolated for EPS performance between threshold and target, and between target and maximum. At the end of fiscal year 2023, the Compensation Committee reviewed our EPS – PS adjusted of $8.66, which was determined by making certain adjustments from GAAP Net Income to exclude certain items that we believe were not representative of our continuing performance, as they were non-recurring or had no cash impact, and could distort our longer-term operating trends, as well as other pre-established adjustments made in accordance with the terms of the awards determined at the beginning of fiscal year 2023. The Compensation Committee determined that the final EPS – PS adjusted result of $8.66 was between the target and maximum goals for fiscal year 2023. At the completion of the entire three-year performance period in November 2025, the sum of the shares credited from the above EPS calculations for the three fiscal years will be modified based on Visa’s TSR Rank for the full three-year performance period. This TSR Rank modification may increase or decrease the final number of shares earned by a maximum of 25%, as illustrated in the chart below; however, the final number of shares earned at the end of the three-year period, after the modification is applied, is capped at 200% of the target award.

The EPS goal for fiscal year 2023 and actual EPS results discussed above also apply to the third tranche of the performance share award previously granted to our NEOs on November 19, 2020 and the second tranche of the performance share award previously granted to our NEOs on November 19, 2021, as illustrated below. 2024 Proxy Statement 65 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Consistent with FASB ASC Topic 718, the value of the performance share awards for fiscal year 2023 included in the “Stock Awards” column of the Executive Compensation – Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2023 later in this proxy statement represents the third segment of the award made on November 19, 2020, the second segment of the award made on November 19, 2021, and the first segment of the award made on November 19, 2022. Determination of Shares Earned for Performance Shares Previously Awarded on November 19, 2020 The performance shares previously awarded to NEOs on November 19, 2020 (fiscal year 2021 performance shares) completed their three-year performance period at the end of fiscal year 2023. As a result, the Compensation Committee determined and certified the Company’s actual results over the three-year period in November 2023, which determined the final number of shares earned pursuant to those awards. As illustrated below, based on the annual EPS results for fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023, and our TSR Rank over the three-year period, the performance shares earned equated to 186.8% of the target award established on November 19, 2020.

As a result, Mr. McInerney earned 57,820 shares versus his target of 30,953 shares, Mr. Kelly earned 92,244 shares versus his target of 49,381 shares, Mr. Prabhu earned 47,247 shares versus his target of 25,293 shares, Mr. Fabara earned 17,212 shares versus his target of 9,214 shares, Mr. Taneja earned 54,897 shares versus his target of 29,388 shares, and Ms. Mahon Tullier earned 22,724 shares versus her target of 12,165 shares. The vesting of shares subject to Mr. Prabhu’s award was due to the retirement vesting provisions of his outstanding award agreement, which provided for vesting of the performance shares at actual performance levels for the full performance period. Long-Term Incentive Awards in Connection with Role Expansions In connection with the Board’s appointment of Mr. McInerney as Chief Executive Officer effective February 1, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved an equity award to Mr. McInerney with a grant date value of $3,000,000. The components and vesting schedule of this grant were consistent with awards granted to Visa’s NEOs during the annual review process. The grant consisted of 25% stock options, 25% restricted stock units, and 50% performance shares, with the stock options and restricted stock units vesting one-third per year on each of the first three annual anniversaries of the grant date. The Compensation Committee also approved one-time performance share awards to Mr. Fabara valued at $3,000,000 on the grant date and to Mr. Taneja and Ms. Mahon Tullier, each valued at $5,000,000 on the grant date. 66 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis For each of the one-time equity awards described in this section, the Compensation Committee considered the NEO’s expanded roles and responsibilities effective February 1, 2023, the performance of the applicable NEO, and the desire to promote stability during the Chief Executive Officer transition. In particular, Mr. Fabara assumed the responsibility of leading Client Services; Mr. Taneja’s responsibilities were expanded to accelerate the integration of engineering and product teams to deliver our product roadmap and overall strategy; and Ms. Mahon Tullier assumed the responsibility of leading the Inclusive Impact and Sustainability, Government Engagement, and Transformation teams and was appointed to the role of Vice Chair, Chief People and Corporate Affairs Officer. The Compensation Committee also received advice from its independent compensation consultant and market data for our compensation peer group when determining the terms of the one-time equity incentive awards. These one-time awards are not routine, are not part of the NEOs’ annual compensation, and are only offered under extraordinary circumstances. Each of the performance shares to Mr. McInerney, Mr. Fabara, Mr. Taneja, and Ms. Mahon Tullier described above is scheduled to vest on February 15, 2026, subject to Visa’s performance in fiscal years 2023 through 2025. The vesting conditions for the performance shares are consistent with the performance shares granted to NEOs during the annual review process in November 2022 and are subject to the same fiscal year 2023 through 2025 EPS and relative TSR goals and payout percentages as described above under the heading Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards Granted in Fiscal Year 2023 – Performance Shares . Each of the equity awards was granted on February 15, 2023, and is subject to the terms and conditions, including vesting requirements, of the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan and the individual award agreement corresponding to the awards. Mr. McInerney will not be eligible to meet the definition of “Retirement” under the applicable equity award agreements during the vesting period for each award, and the one-time awards to Mr. Fabara, Mr. Taneja, and Ms. Mahon Tullier do not contain retirement vesting terms. One-Time Compensation Arrangement for Mr. Suh Upon Joining Visa The Compensation Committee may approve compensation during the fiscal year to attract new executive officers and incentivize them to join Visa. The following one-time compensation arrangements are not considered to be a part of Mr. Suh’s ongoing target annual compensation. In connection with Mr. Suh’s hiring, the Compensation Committee approved a one-time equity award with a grant date fair value of $11,000,000, granted on August 15, 2023. $10,200,000 of the award was to compensate Mr. Suh for unvested equity and other incentives he forfeited when he departed his prior employer, and $800,000 of the award was an additional incentive to join Visa. This one-time equity award consisted of restricted stock units vesting on each of the first, second, and third anniversaries of the date of grant, assuming Mr. Suh’s continued employment by Visa through each vesting date. In addition, to compensate Mr. Suh for forfeited bonus payments and other incentives from his prior employer, Mr. Suh received a one-time cash award of $3,000,000 paid upon joining Visa. $1,300,000 of this one-time cash award was in recognition of Mr. Suh’s obligation to reimburse a portion of the sign-on bonus he received from his prior employer. Mr. Suh is required to repay a pro-rata portion of this one-time cash award if he terminates his employment other than for Good Reason (as defined in Mr. Suh’s One-Time Cash Award Agreement attached to his offer letter) or if his employment is terminated for Cause (as defined in Visa’s Executive Severance Plan) within 12 months of his start date with Visa. In addition, Mr. Suh received a $500,000 cash payment corresponding to the amount he was required to reimburse his prior employer for relocation and related expenses. Modification of Outstanding Stock Options and Performance Shares in Fiscal Year 2023 For All Participants In January 2023, the Compensation Committee reviewed the treatment of stock options and performance shares upon an employee’s termination of employment due to the employee’s death, Disability, or Retirement (“Disability” and “Retirement” as defined in the applicable equity award agreement). The Compensation Committee considered issues such as the intended benefit to employees and their families in these situations, consistency between the treatment of award types, the long-term focus of equity awards and alignment with stockholder interests, and the practices of peer companies and overall market competitiveness, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee considered the treatment of equity awards held by all active employees, not simply the NEOs, in the event of termination of employment due to death, Disability, and Retirement. 2024 Proxy Statement 67 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Following this review, the Compensation Committee amended all outstanding stock options held by active employees as of the date of the amendment (including the NEOs other than Mr. Suh) to remove the three-year exercise deadline following a termination of employment due to the employee’s death, Disability, or Retirement. As amended, vested stock options in these situations may now be exercised until the option expiration date set forth in the individual’s stock option award agreement. The Compensation Committee also amended all outstanding performance shares held by active employees as of the date of the amendment (including the NEOs other than Mr. Suh) to provide that upon termination of employment due to the employee’s death or Disability prior to the end of the performance period, the performance shares will now vest in the full number of shares on the vesting date, rather than a pro-rata portion of the shares, as if the individual had remained employed throughout the entire performance period. The number of shares that vest is based on actual company performance. Except as described in this section, there were no other amendments to outstanding equity awards. In accordance with applicable SEC rules, the Summary Compensation Table includes as compensation for each applicable NEO the incremental fair value of this modification, as determined under generally accepted accounting principles, for each of the outstanding stock option awards held by the NEOs as of the date of the amendment. A corresponding amount for each award is also included in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2023 table . The modification of the performance share awards resulted in no incremental fair value and therefore no values are included in the Summary Compensation Table or Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2023 table representing the modifications to the performance share awards. Retirement and Other Benefits Our benefits program is designed to be competitive and cost-effective. It is our objective to provide core benefits, including medical, retirement, life insurance, paid time off, and leaves of absence, to all employees and to allow for supplementary non-core benefits to accommodate regulatory, cultural, and practical differences in the various geographies in which we have operations. We sponsor a frozen tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, which we refer to as the retirement plan. We also sponsor a tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan, which we refer to as the 401k plan, to provide market driven retirement benefits to all eligible employees in the United States. We maintained a non-qualified excess retirement benefit plan and a non-qualified excess 401k plan to make up for the limitations imposed on our tax-qualified plans by the Internal Revenue Code. New contributions to these non-qualified plans ceased to be effective February 1, 2014. We also sponsor an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which we refer to as the deferred compensation plan, which allows executive officers and certain other highly compensated employees to defer a portion of their annual incentive awards to help them with tax planning and to provide competitive benefits. For additional information on these plans, see the sections entitled Executive Compensation – Pension Benefits Table for Fiscal Year 2023 and Executive Compensation – Non-qualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2023. Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits We provide limited perquisites and other personal benefits to facilitate the performance of our NEOs’ management responsibilities. For instance, we maintain a company car and driver that allows for additional security, which are used by the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Chairman for both business and personal use, as well as some business and limited personal use by other executive officers. From time to time, our NEOs also may use the Company’s tickets for sporting, cultural, or other events for personal use rather than business purposes. If an incremental cost is incurred for such use, it is included in the “All Other Compensation” column of the Executive Compensation – Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2023 if the aggregate amount paid by the Company in Fiscal Year 2023 for perquisites and personal benefits to an NEO equaled $10,000 or more. In addition, we have a policy that allows for companion travel on business-related flights on company-provided private aircraft (whether corporate aircraft owned by Visa or chartered aircraft provided by Visa) by the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Chairman, and other key employees, as approved by the Chief Executive Officer. It is our policy that NEOs are responsible for all income taxes related to their personal usage of the Company car or company-provided aircraft, as well as travel by their companions. Additionally, no NEO may use company-provided aircraft for exclusive personal use (not related to business) except under the terms and conditions outlined in the Company’s aircraft time-sharing agreements with the Chief Executive Officer and the 68 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Executive Chairman, or under extraordinary circumstances with the advance approval of the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee requires that Mr. McInerney and Mr. Kelly use company-provided aircraft for all business and personal travel, based on an independent third-party finding of a bona fide security concern, which recommended that Mr. McInerney and Mr. Kelly use the aircraft for all travel. Related to this requirement, Mr. McInerney and Mr. Kelly are each required under the terms of the applicable aircraft time-sharing agreement to reimburse Visa for personal use of company-provided aircraft for amounts in excess of $250,000 per fiscal year. Any personal use of the company-provided aircraft in excess of this limit by our Chief Executive Officer or our Executive Chairman pursuant to the aircraft time-sharing agreements requires them to reimburse Visa an amount (as determined by the Company) equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount that would, absent reimbursement, be reportable with respect to the Executive Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer (as applicable) in the Summary Compensation Table (which we refer to as the SEC Cost), or (ii) the expenses of operating such flight that may be charged pursuant to Federal Aviation Regulation Section 91.501(d) as in effect from time to time (which we refer to as the FAR Expenses). Severance In order to attract and retain high-performing NEOs, we believe it is appropriate to provide severance to an executive officer in certain circumstances. Our severance arrangements are reasonable, responsible in value, tailored to the circumstances of the termination of employment, and in line with market practice. We do not gross up for excise taxes that may be imposed as a result of severance payments and, for payments payable upon or following a change of control, we require a qualifying termination of employment in addition to the change of control. Please see the section entitled Executive Compensation – Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control – Executive Severance Plan for additional information. Fiscal Year 2024 Compensation On November 2, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved the annual equity awards for our NEOs to be granted on November 19, 2023. The equity awards to Mr. McInerney, Mr. Suh, Mr. Fabara, Mr. Taneja, and Ms. Mahon Tullier used a combination of 25% of the total value of equity awards in stock options, 25% in restricted stock units, and 50% in performance shares at the target value, reflecting the same mix as used in prior years. The actual number of performance shares earned will be based on the annual EPS goal established for each of the three fiscal years in the performance period and an overall modifier based on our TSR Rank over the three-year performance period. For continued service provided to the Company through each date, the Compensation Committee approved an annual equity award to Mr. Kelly consisting of restricted stock units vesting in three equal installments on December 1, 2023, January 1, 2024, and February 1, 2024. Mr. Prabhu terminated employment with the Company effective September 30, 2023, and did not receive a fiscal year 2024 equity award. Vesting of the equity awards is generally subject to each NEO’s continued employment through the entire period, except upon certain terminations of employment due to death, disability, retirement, and certain qualifying (double-trigger) terminations in connection with a change in control. A portion of the equity awards is subject to pro-rata payment in the event of a termination by Visa without cause. 2024 Proxy Statement 69 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Consistent with prior fiscal years, the total combined value of each equity award was approved by the Compensation Committee after considering, in consultation with its independent consultant, the practices of companies in our compensation peer group, the actual compensation levels of similarly situated executive officers of companies in our compensation peer group, corporate and individual performance during fiscal year 2023, recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer (for awards to the NEOs other than himself and the Executive Chairman), and each NEO’s total compensation, including the value of outstanding awards held by the NEOs. The values in the table below will differ from the values in the Executive Compensation – Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2024 and the Executive Compensation – Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2024 Table because the aggregate grant date fair values of the performance shares that will be displayed in those tables will be computed in accordance with stock-based accounting rules and will be displayed in multiple years.

Under the Equity Grant Policy, the Compensation Committee approves annual grants to executive officers and other members of the Executive Committee at a meeting to occur during the quarter following each fiscal year end. The Board has delegated the authority to Mr. McInerney as the sole member of the Stock Committee to make annual awards to employees who are not members of the Executive Committee and who are not subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (Section 16 officers). The grant date for annual awards to all employees has been established as November 19 of each year. In addition to the annual grants, stock awards may be granted at other times during the year to new hires, employees receiving promotions, and in other special circumstances. The Equity Grant Policy provides that only the Compensation Committee may make such “off-cycle” grants to NEOs, other members of Visa’s Executive Committee, and Section 16 officers. The Compensation Committee has delegated the authority to the Stock Committee to make off-cycle grants to other employees, subject to guidelines established by the Compensation Committee. Any off-cycle awards approved by the Stock Committee or the Compensation Committee are granted on the 15 th day of the calendar month or on such other date determined by the Stock Committee, Compensation Committee, or the Board. For all stock option awards, the exercise price is the closing price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE on the date of the grant. If the grant date falls on a non-trading day, the exercise price is the closing price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE on the last trading day preceding the date of grant. 70 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Stock Ownership Guidelines The Compensation Committee maintains stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs as follows: Officer Stock Ownership Guidelines Ryan McInerney 6 x base salary Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. 6 x base salary Chris Suh 4 x base salary Paul Fabara 3 x base salary Rajat Taneja 4 x base salary Kelly Mahon Tullier 4 x base salary Mr. Prabhu had a stock ownership guideline of 4x, which applied until his departure from Visa on September 30, 2023. Equity interests that count toward the satisfaction of the ownership guidelines include shares owned outright by the individual, shares jointly owned, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and any deferred restricted stock units. Unexercised stock options and unearned performance shares do not count toward the guidelines. Newly hired or promoted executives have five years from the date of the commencement of their appointment to attain these ownership levels. Each NEO currently meets or exceeds the applicable guideline set forth in the table above. If an executive officer does not meet the applicable guideline by the end of the five-year period, the executive officer is required to hold a minimum of 50% of the net shares resulting from any future vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, or exercise of stock options until the guideline is met. These guidelines reinforce the importance of aligning the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stakeholders and encourage our executive officers to consider the long-term perspective when managing the Company. Hedging and Pledging Prohibition As part of our insider trading policy, all employees, including our NEOs, and non-employee directors are prohibited from engaging in short sales of our securities, establishing margin accounts related to our securities, pledging our securities as collateral for a loan, buying or selling puts or calls on our securities, or otherwise engaging in hedging transactions (such as zero-cost collars, exchange funds, and forward sale contracts) involving our securities. Recoupment Policies The Board has adopted amendments to our Clawback Policy to comply with the requirements of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and NYSE. In addition to the terms required under the Dodd-Frank Act for mandatory recovery of certain incentive compensation paid to executive officers in the event of a material financial restatement, the amended Clawback Policy retains Board discretion to recover any incentive compensation (including time-based restricted stock units and stock options) paid to current and former Executive Committee members (including non-executive officers) and Section 16 officers if the financial results upon which the awards were based are materially restated due to fraud, intentional misconduct, or gross negligence (fault-based restatement). The Clawback Policy permits the Board to determine if it will seek to recover applicable compensation in the event of a fault-based restatement, taking into account a number of considerations as it deems appropriate. We believe our Clawback Policy, which exceeds the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, further reduces the potential risk that an executive officer or Executive Committee member would intentionally misstate results to benefit under an incentive program. In addition, appropriate language regarding the policy has been included in applicable documents and award agreements, and our executive officers are required to acknowledge in writing that compensation we have awarded to them may be subject to reimbursement, clawback, or forfeiture pursuant to the terms of the policy and/or applicable law. Further, the equity forfeiture provisions in applicable award agreements would also apply in the event of specified detrimental activity in the absence of a restatement. 2024 Proxy Statement 71 Table of Contents Compensation Discussion and Analysis Tax Implications – Deductibility of Executive Compensation Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limits our ability to deduct for tax purposes compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain executive officers. We expect that compensation paid to our NEOs in excess of $1 million, including compensation paid to any executive who has been an NEO since 2017, generally will not be deductible. When designing our compensation structure, the Compensation Committee believes that it needs to consider all relevant factors that attract, retain, and reward executives responsible for our success. For information regarding the Compensation Committee’s review of compensation-related risk, please see the section entitled Committees of the Board of Directors – Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs . 72 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Executive Compensation Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2023 The following table and related footnotes describe the total compensation earned for services rendered during fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 by our NEOs, except that only fiscal year 2023 compensation is reported for Mr. Suh and Mr. Fabara because they were not NEOs in fiscal years 2022 and 2021. The primary elements of each NEO’s total compensation as reported in the table are base salary, annual incentive compensation, and long-term incentive compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, and performance shares. Certain other benefits are listed in the “All Other Compensation” column and additional detail about these benefits is provided in the Executive Compensation – All Other Compensation in Fiscal Year 2023 Table .

Actual awards are dependent on actual results measured against pre-established performance goals, as described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation – Annual Incentive Plan . There is no threshold level of performance for the VIP in fiscal year 2023. The amounts shown in the “maximum” column are 200% of the target amount, which is the maximum possible award. The actual amounts awarded to our NEOs under the annual incentive plan for fiscal year 2023 are included in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the Executive Compensation – Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2023 . (3) Represents the range of possible awards of performance shares granted in fiscal year 2023. Awards are capped at the maximum of 200% and can be as low as zero. (4) Equity awards made pursuant to the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan will vest according to their terms, but may be subject to earlier vesting in full or in part or continued vesting in the event of a termination of a grantee’s employment due to the grantee’s death, “disability,” “retirement,” termination without “cause,” or a termination following a “change of control” of a grantee’s employment by us without “cause” or by the grantee for “good reason.” The terms disability, retirement, change of control, cause, and good reason are all defined in the applicable award agreement or the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan. (5) The exercise price of these stock options was the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. For stock options modified on January 23, 2023, as described in footnote 12, the original exercise price is presented. The original grant date and corresponding exercise price for each such stock option is as follows: 11/19/2016 for $80.82, 11/19/2017 for $109.82, 11/19/2018 for $134.76, 10/15/2019 for $178.75, 11/19/2019 for $182.77, 11/19/2020 for $207.57, 11/19/2021 for $200.86, and 11/19/2022 for $210.80. (6) Amounts are not an actual dollar amount received by our NEOs in fiscal year 2023, but instead represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the equity awards calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The aggregate grant date fair value calculation for the performance shares is discussed in more detail in footnote 11 below. (7) Consistent with the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 718, the amount represents the third of three portions of the performance share award made on November 19, 2020 for which the grant date fair value was established on November 19, 2022. The shares earned from this award vested on November 30, 2023. (8) Consistent with the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 718, the amount represents the second third of the performance share award made on November 19, 2021 for which the grant date fair value was established on November 19, 2022. The shares earned from this award are scheduled to vest on November 30, 2024. (9) Consistent with the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 718, the amount represents the first third of the performance share award made on November 19, 2022 for which the grant date fair value was established on November 19, 2022. The shares earned from this award are scheduled to vest on November 30, 2025. (10) Consistent with the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 718, the amount represents the first third of the performance share award made on February 15, 2023 for which the grant date fair value was established on February 15, 2023. The shares earned from these awards are scheduled to vest on February 15, 2026. (11) Represents the value of performance shares based on the probable outcome as of the date of grant determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 using a Monte Carlo simulation. (12) The reported amount represents the incremental fair value, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of the modification of outstanding stock options to remove the three-year exercise deadline following a termination of employment due to death, Disability, or Retirement and provide that vested stock options in these situations may now be exercised until the option expiration date set forth in the individual’s stock option award agreement. This treatment applied to all outstanding stock options held by active employees.

Pension Benefits Table for Fiscal Year 2023 The following table shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to our NEOs and the number of years of service credited to each executive under the Visa Retirement Plan and the Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan. The value of the benefits is determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company’s fiscal year 2023 audited consolidated financial statements.

Benefit accruals under the Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan were discontinued effective February 1, 2014. Each of the NEOs except Mr. Kelly, Mr. Suh, and Mr. Fabara is fully vested under the Visa Retirement Plan. Mr. Kelly, Mr. Suh, and Mr. Fabara are not eligible participants in the Visa Retirement Plan or the Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan. Visa Retirement Plan and Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan Under the Visa Retirement Plan, certain U.S.-based employees, including our NEOs, other than Mr. Kelly, Mr. Fabara, and Mr. Suh, generally earn the right to receive certain benefits: • upon retirement at the normal retirement age of 65; • upon early retirement at or after age 55 (or at or after age 50 if hired prior to October 1, 2002) and having completed at least ten years of service with us; or • upon an earlier termination of employment, but solely if the employee is vested at that time. Prior to January 1, 2011, retirement benefits were calculated as the product of 1.25% times the employee’s years of service multiplied by the employee’s monthly final average earnings for the last 60 consecutive months before retirement (or, for employees hired prior to October 1, 2002, the product of 46.25% times the employee’s years of service divided by 25 years, multiplied by the employee’s monthly final average earnings for the 36 highest consecutive months in the last 60 months before retirement). Eligible earnings include salary, overtime, shift differentials, special and merit awards, and short-term cash incentive awards. If an employee retires early, that is, between the ages of 55 and 64 (or between the ages of 50 and 61 if hired prior to October 1, 2002), and has completed at least ten years of service with the Company, the amount of that employee’s benefits is reduced for each complete year that the employee begins receiving early retirement benefits before the age of 65 (or before the age of 62 if hired prior to October 1, 2002). If an employee retires prior to becoming eligible for early or normal retirement, the amount of his or her benefits is actuarially reduced and is generally not as large as if the employee had continued employment until his or her early or normal retirement date. The Visa Retirement Plan began transitioning to cash balance benefits effective January 1, 2008 and completed the transition effective January 1, 2011. The change to a cash balance benefit formula took effect immediately for employees hired or rehired after December 31, 2007. However, for employees hired before January 1, 2008 (and not rehired thereafter), the applicable Visa Retirement Plan benefit formula described above was grandfathered for a three-year period, and grandfathered employees continued to accrue benefits under that benefit formula. Their accrued benefits at December 31, 2010 (the last day of the grandfathered period) or the date they terminated employment, if earlier, were preserved. Because we completed the conversion to a cash balance plan formula beginning on January 1, 2011, all benefit accruals from that date until December 31, 2015 were under the cash balance benefit formula. Prior to January 1, 2016, under the cash balance plan formula, 6% of an employee’s eligible monthly pay was credited each month to the employee’s notional cash balance account, along with interest each month on the account balance at an annualized rate equal to the 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond average annual interest rate for November of the previous calendar year. The employer-provided credits described above ceased after December 31, 2015 and the Visa Retirement Plan had no new participants after that date. Interest credits continue to be provided on balances existing at the time of this freeze. Accrued benefits under the Visa Retirement Plan become fully vested and nonforfeitable after three years of service. Prior to February 1, 2014, we also provided for benefit accruals under an excess retirement benefit plan. To the extent that an employee’s annual retirement income benefit under the Visa Retirement Plan exceeds the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, such excess benefit is paid from our non-qualified, unfunded, noncontributory Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan. The vesting provisions of, and formula used to calculate the benefit payable pursuant to, the Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan are generally the same as those of the Visa Retirement Plan described above, except that benefits are calculated without regard to the Internal Revenue Code tax-qualified plan limits and then offset for benefits paid under the qualified plan. Effective February 1, 2014, we discontinued benefit accruals under the Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan. 84 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Non-qualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2023 Visa Deferred Compensation Plan Under the terms of the Visa Deferred Compensation Plan, eligible participants are able to defer up to 100% of their cash incentive awards if they submit a qualified deferral election. Benefits under the Visa Deferred Compensation Plan will be paid based on one of the following three distribution dates or events previously elected by the participant: (i) immediately upon, or up to five years following, retirement; (ii) immediately upon, or in the January following, termination; or (iii) if specifically elected by the participant, in January in a specified year while actively employed. However, upon a showing of financial hardship and receipt of approval from the plan administrator, a plan participant may be allowed to access funds in his or her deferred compensation account earlier than his or her existing distribution election(s). Benefits can be received either as a lump sum payment or in annual installments, except in the case of pre-retirement termination, in which case the participant must receive the benefit in a lump sum. Participants are always fully vested in their deferrals under the Visa Deferred Compensation Plan. Upon termination of the Visa Deferred Compensation Plan within 12 months of a “change of control,” participants’ benefits under the Visa Deferred Compensation Plan will be paid immediately in a lump sum. Visa Directors Deferred Compensation Under the terms of the Visa Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors are able to defer up to 100% of their fees payable in cash if they submit a qualified deferral election. Unless a participant’s separation from service constitutes his or her “retirement,” the participant’s benefits under the Visa Directors Deferred Compensation Plan will be paid in a lump sum in cash, as previously elected by the participant, either (i) within 90 days following the date of the separation from service, or (ii) on the next January 1 following the separation from service. Participants are always fully vested in their deferrals under the Visa Directors Deferred Compensation Plan. Upon termination of the Visa Director Deferred Compensation Plan within 12 months of a “change of control,” participants’ benefits under the Visa Director Deferred Compensation Plan will be paid immediately in a lump sum. Further, under the terms of the restricted stock unit award agreements applicable to directors, provided they submit a qualified deferral election, directors are eligible to defer settlement of the restricted stock units they receive for service on the Board until the later of (i) the first anniversary of the grant date or (ii) a date or dates during their service or following their separation from service, subject to earlier settlement upon the participant’s death or following a change in control. Visa 401k Plan and Visa Excess 401k Plan The Visa 401k Plan is a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement savings plan pursuant to which all of our U.S.-based employees, including our NEOs, are able to contribute up to 50%, or 13% for highly compensated employees, of their salary up to the limit prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code to the Visa 401k Plan on a pre-tax basis. Employees also have the option of contributing on an after-tax basis up to 50%, or 13% for highly compensated employees, of salary or a combination of pre-tax and after-tax contributions that do not exceed 50%, or 13% for highly compensated employees, of salary. All contributions are subject to the Internal Revenue Code limits. If an employee reaches the statutory pre-tax contribution limit during the calendar year, an employee may continue to make contributions to the Visa 401k Plan on an after-tax basis, subject to any applicable statutory limits. During fiscal year 2023, we contributed a matching amount equal to 200% of the first 5% of salary that was contributed by all plan participants, including NEOs, to the Visa 401k Plan. All employee and matching contributions to the Visa 401k Plan are fully vested upon contribution. Prior to February 1, 2014, we also provided for a contribution in an excess 401k plan. Because the Internal Revenue Code limits the maximum amount a company and an employee can contribute to an employee’s 401(k) plan account each year, we continued to provide the matching contribution, after the applicable Internal Revenue Code limits are reached, to the Visa Excess 401k Plan, which is a non-qualified noncontributory retirement savings plan. Employees are eligible to participate in the Visa Excess 401k Plan if their salaries are greater than the Internal Revenue Code pay cap or if the total of their contributions and our matching contributions to the Visa 401k Plan exceed the Internal Revenue Code benefit limit. The features of the Visa Excess 401k Plan are generally the same as under the Visa 401k Plan, except that benefits cannot be rolled over to an IRA or another employer’s qualified plan. Effective February 1, 2014, we discontinued any future contributions to the Visa Excess 401k Plan. 2024 Proxy Statement 85 Table of Contents Executive Compensation The following table provides information about each of our NEO’s contributions, earnings, distributions, and balances under the Visa Deferred Compensation Plan, the Visa Excess 401k Plan, the Director Deferred Compensation Plan, and amounts deferred under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan in fiscal year 2023.

Employment Arrangements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control The following discussion relates only to the offer letters with our NEOs under which we still have outstanding obligations as of fiscal year 2023. We do not have fixed-term employment agreements with our NEOs. Offer Letter with Chris Suh On June 16, 2023, we entered into an offer letter agreement with Chris Suh under which he joined Visa as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Designate on July 10, 2023, and was appointed Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer effective August 1, 2023. The offer letter was the result of negotiations with the Company, during which the Compensation Committee consulted with Meridian, its independent compensation consultant. In connection with the negotiation of the offer letter, the Compensation Committee also reviewed relevant market data, the compensation levels of our other executive officers, and the terms of Mr. Suh’s compensation arrangements with his previous employer, including the value he would forfeit with, or be required to repay to, such employer by agreeing to join Visa. The offer letter provided that Mr. Suh will receive a base salary of $900,000 and that he would be eligible to participate in the Visa Incentive Plan, with a target annual incentive opportunity of 175% of his base salary and a maximum annual incentive opportunity of 350% of his base salary, pro-rated to reflect the portion of fiscal year 2023 he was employed with Visa. On August 15, 2023, as required under the terms of his offer letter, Mr. Suh received a one-time award of $11,000,000 in restricted stock units. $10,200,000 of the award was to compensate Mr. Suh for unvested equity and other incentives he forfeited when he departed his prior employer, and $800,000 of the award was as an additional incentive. One-third of the restricted stock units subject to this one-time equity award is scheduled to vest on each of the first, second, and third anniversaries of the date of grant, assuming Mr. Suh’s continued employment by Visa through each vesting date. 2024 Proxy Statement 87 Table of Contents Executive Compensation In addition, as required under the terms of his offer letter, Mr. Suh received a one-time cash award of $3,000,000 upon joining Visa, to compensate Mr. Suh for forfeited bonus payments and other incentives from his prior employer. $1,300,000 of this one-time cash award was in recognition of Mr. Suh’s obligation to reimburse a portion of the sign-on bonus he received from his prior employer. Mr. Suh is required to repay a pro-rata portion of this one-time cash award if he terminates his employment other than for Good Reason (as defined in Mr. Suh’s One-Time Cash Award Agreement attached to this offer letter) or if his employment is terminated for Cause (as defined in Visa’s Executive Severance Plan) within 12 months of his start date with Visa. In addition, Mr. Suh received a $500,000 cash payment corresponding to the amount he was required to reimburse his prior employer for relocation and related expenses. Pursuant to the terms of his offer letter, Mr. Suh is also eligible to participate in the Visa Inc. Executive Severance Plan, the terms of which are discussed below. Pursuant to the terms of the offer letter, the recommended award value was $9,000,000 for Mr. Suh’s annual equity award granted November 19, 2023. As described under the heading Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Fiscal Year 2024 Compensation , this award consisted of the typical mix for annual equity awards to our NEOs, with 25% of the total value in stock options, 25% in restricted stock units, and 50% in performance shares at the target value. Executive Severance Plan We believe it is appropriate to provide severance pay to an executive officer whose employment is involuntarily terminated by us without “cause” or whose employment is voluntarily terminated by the executive for “good reason” within two years following a change of control (each as defined in the Visa Inc. Executive Severance Plan). These severance benefits are intended to secure the continued services of executive officers, provide them with certain benefits in the event of a covered termination, and encourage their continued dedication to their duties notwithstanding the possibility or occurrence of a change in control. We believe the level of severance provided by our Executive Severance Plan is reasonable, responsible in value, consistent with the practices of our compensation peer group, and necessary to attract and retain key high-performing employees. Our NEOs are participants in the Executive Severance Plan, which provides for a capped, lump sum severance upon a qualifying termination of two times the sum of the executive’s base salary and target annual incentive award, a prorated bonus for any partial performance period under the annual incentive plan, and a cash amount equal to the cost of continued health benefits for two years post-termination. These benefits are subject to the NEO’s timely execution and non- revocation of a waiver and release of claims. For purposes of the Executive Severance Plan, a qualifying termination is limited to an involuntary termination by us without cause at any time or a resignation by the participant for good reason within two years following a change of control. Executive Severance Plan participants are required to comply with certain restrictive covenants, including obligations to uphold confidentiality and to abstain from soliciting Visa’s employees, customers, and clients for eighteen months following a qualifying termination of the participant’s employment. Participants are also generally bound by the confidentiality, intellectual property, and non-solicitation provisions of any Confidential Information and Property Agreement, Proprietary Information Agreement, and/or any similar agreement previously executed by the applicable participant and the confidentiality provisions under Visa’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Executive Severance Plan does not provide for any gross-ups for excise taxes imposed as a result of severance or other payments deemed made in connection with a change of control. Mr. Prabhu’s departure on September 30, 2023, was a termination without cause for purposes of the Executive Severance Plan. Accordingly, subject to Mr. Prabhu’s execution and non-revocation of a waiver and release of claims and compliance with applicable restrictive covenants, Mr. Prabhu is entitled to the Executive Severance Plan payments described in the preceding paragraph. Such payments are quantified in the “Involuntary Not for Cause” column of the table below entitled “Termination Payments and Benefits for Vasant Prabhu.” Cash Severance Policy for Section 16 Officers In November 2023, we adopted a cash severance policy (Severance Policy), which provides that we will not enter into any new employment agreement, severance agreement, or separation agreement with any Section 16 officer, or establish any new severance plan or policy covering any Section 16 officer, in each case that provides for “cash severance benefits” (as defined in the Severance Policy) exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the Section 16 officer’s base salary plus target bonus, unless we seek stockholder ratification of such agreement, plan, or policy. 88 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Equity Incentive Awards Pursuant to the terms of certain award agreements under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, if the employment of an NEO is involuntarily terminated by Visa without “cause” or voluntarily terminated by the NEO for “good reason”, in each case within two years following a change of control (as such terms are defined in the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan or applicable award agreement), then the unvested portion of any such equity incentive award will become fully vested (and at target levels, with respect to performance shares). There are no “single-trigger” payments available to NEOs upon a change of control. Under the terms of the equity incentive awards granted since November 19, 2021, if an NEO is involuntarily terminated by Visa without cause, the awards are paid on a pro-rated basis measured from the date of grant to the date of termination. Similar to the cash benefits described under Executive Compensation – Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control – Executive Severance Plan above, these equity award terms are reasonable, consistent with the practices of our compensation peer group, and necessary to attract and retain key high-performing employees. Quantification of Termination Payments and Benefits The following tables reflect the amount of compensation that would be paid to each of our NEOs in the event of a termination of the individual’s employment under various scenarios. For NEOs other than Mr. Prabhu, the amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of September 30, 2023, and include estimates of the amounts that would be paid to each NEO upon such individual’s termination. For Mr. Prabhu, the table reflects amounts payable under the Executive Severance Plan as a result of Mr. Prabhu’s actual termination of employment on September 30, 2023, and estimates of the amounts that will also be payable pursuant to the retirement vesting terms of his outstanding equity awards. All equity values reported in the following tables are based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE as of September 29, 2023. The “Health and Welfare Benefits” for NEOs other than Mr. Prabhu reflect the estimated value of benefits payable for 24 months upon disability and for 6 months upon death; for Mr. Prabhu, the “Health and Welfare Benefits” reflect the cash amount equal to the cost of continued health benefits for two years post-termination. The tables only include additional benefits that result from the termination and do not include any amounts or benefits earned, vested, accrued, or owing under any plan for any other reason. Please see the Executive Compensation – Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2023 Table, the Pension Benefits Table for Fiscal Year 2023, and the section entitled Non-qualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2023 for additional information. Payments that would be made over a period of time have been estimated as the lump sum present value using 120% of the applicable federal rate. The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of such NEO’s separation from Visa.

For our last completed fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the ratio of the median of the annual total compensation of our employees, excluding our Chief Executive Officer (Mr. McInerney), to the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, was 151:1. This ratio was calculated using annual total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, under applicable reporting rules, of $22,667,747 and annual total compensation of the median employee of $149,782. To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the median employee, the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates used were as follows (which may differ from those used, and may therefore not be comparable to ratios reported by, other companies): Median Employee We identified our median employee from our worldwide employee population, including both part-time and full-time employees other than our CEO, as of September 30, 2023. Given the worldwide geographical distribution of our employee population, we use a variety of pay elements to structure the compensation arrangements of our employees. A significant number of our employees around the world participate in our annual cash bonus and equity incentive award plans. Consequently, to identify the median employee, we selected base salary or wages plus overtime pay, annual cash bonus plan payments, and equity award grant date values as the most appropriate measure of compensation. We measured compensation for our employees using the 12-month fiscal period ending September 30, 2023. We selected September 30, 2023 as our measurement date, which was the last day of our 2023 fiscal year, because it provided the most accurate information regarding compensation for such fiscal year. In making this determination, we did not make any cost-of-living adjustments. Annual Total Compensation To determine the annual total compensation of the median employee, we identified and calculated the elements of the employee’s compensation for 2023 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. Mr. McInerney began serving as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer effective February 1, 2023. As permitted by Instruction 10 to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, for pay ratio purposes, Mr. McInerney’s compensation was annualized to represent his compensation as if he were CEO for the entire 2023 fiscal year. The calculation included the amounts reported in the Executive Compensation – Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2023 , except that the salary was adjusted to assume Mr. McInerney received his year-end base salary rate for the entire fiscal year, and applicable elements of “All Other Compensation” were adjusted to assume he was CEO for the entire fiscal year. Consequently, the annual total compensation reported for CEO pay ratio purposes does not reflect the “Total” column of our Executive Compensation – Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2023 included in this proxy statement, nor does it reflect amounts actually paid to our CEO for fiscal year 2023. Instead, the annual total compensation reported for the CEO above reflects the pay ratio disclosure requirements for a year in which a CEO transition occurs. 2024 Proxy Statement 93 Table of Contents Pay Versus Performance Pay Versus Performance As required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about executive compensation and the Company’s performance for the fiscal years listed below. The compensation information presented in this table is calculated in accordance with SEC rules and related guidance; it may be different from the compensation information presented in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement and does not represent amounts actually earned or realized by our NEOs. For purposes of the “compensation actually paid” calculations presented in footnotes 2 and 3, any unvested awards that are eligible for continued vesting if an NEO retires are counted as unvested, even if an NEO has met the retirement eligibility criteria. For further information about how we align executive compensation with the Company’s performance, see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement.

The comparison assumes $100 was invested for the period starting September 29, 2020, through the end of the listed year in the Company and in the S&P 500 Financials index, respectively. Historical stock performance is not necessarily indicative of future stock performance. (5) In accordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K and associated guidance, “Net Income” represents GAAP Net Income for purposes of the pay versus performance disclosure. In contrast, as discussed above under the heading “Annual Incentive Plan” in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the net income metric that we used for our annual incentive plan was Net Income Growth-VIP adjusted. (6) We determined EPS, as adjusted for purposes of performance share awards, to be the most important financial performance measure used to link Company performance to Compensation Actually Paid to our PEOs and Non-PEO NEOs for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. See the Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Performance Shares – EPS Goals in this proxy statement for a description of adjustments from GAAP EPS for purposes of performance share awards granted to the NEOs. EPS – PS adjusted may not have been the most important financial performance measure for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, and we may determine a different financial performance measure to be the most important financial performance measure in future years. Relationship Between Pay and Performance The graphs presented below describe the relationship between compensation actually paid (calculated in accordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K) and our net income, EPS – PS adjusted, and cumulative total shareholder return over the three-year period from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2023. 2024 Proxy Statement 95 Table of Contents Pay Versus Performance Financial Performance Measures Performance share awards represent the largest component of our annual executive compensation program, with vesting determined based on EPS and relative TSR performance. In addition, as described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Annual Incentive Plan , our annual incentive scorecard design incentivizes our NEOs to be focused on a wide range of performance goals that are critical to our corporate strategy, by promoting financial performance goals along with other priorities that are vital to the Company’s long-term success, such as ESG initiatives. This design takes a holistic approach to the goal-setting process and does not apply specific weighting to the corporate performance goals in the annual incentive scorecard; the Compensation Committee carefully considers each goal in its overall evaluation of corporate performance. Below, in an unranked order, are the most important financial performance measures used to link executive compensation actually paid to the NEOs to company performance for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023: EPS – PS adjusted Relative TSR Net Revenues Growth – VIP adjusted Net Income Growth – VIP adjusted EPS Growth – VIP adjusted 96 Table of Contents Equity Compensation Plan Information Equity Compensation Plan Information The table below presents information as of September 30, 2023, for the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan and the Visa Inc.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan. (2) The weighted-average exercise price is calculated based solely on the exercise prices of the outstanding stock options and does not reflect the shares that will be issued upon the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and performance shares, which have no exercise price. Additionally, it excludes the weighted-average exercise price of the outstanding purchase rights under the Visa Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. (3) As of September 30, 2023, 90 million shares and 13 million shares remain available for issuance under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan and the Visa Inc.

The Audit and Risk Committee has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the financial statements of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. KPMG has been our independent auditor since our initial public offering in 2008, and KPMG audited our financial statements for fiscal year 2023. The Audit and Risk Committee also periodically considers whether there should be a rotation of independent registered public accounting firms because the Audit and Risk Committee believes it is important for the registered public accounting firm to maintain independence and objectivity. In determining whether to reappoint KPMG, the Audit and Risk Committee considered several factors, including: • the length of time KPMG has been engaged; • KPMG’s independence and objectivity; • KPMG’s capability and expertise in handling the complexity of Visa’s global operations in our industry; • historical and recent performance, including the extent and quality of KPMG’s communications with the Audit and Risk Committee, and feedback from management regarding KPMG’s overall performance; • recent PCAOB inspection reports on the firm; and • the appropriateness of KPMG’s fees, both on an absolute basis and as compared with its peers. The Audit and Risk Committee believes that the continued retention of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders, and we are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2024. Although ratification is not required, the Board is submitting a proposal to ratify KPMG’s appointment to our stockholders because we value our stockholders’ views and as a matter of good corporate practice. In the event that our stockholders fail to ratify KPMG as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, it will be considered a recommendation to the Audit and Risk Committee to consider the selection of a different firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit and Risk Committee may in its discretion select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. A representative of KPMG will be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024. 98 Table of Contents Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed to the Company by KPMG for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 (in thousands): Services Provided Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2022 Audit fees (1) $ 11,033 $ 11,666 Audit-related fees (2) $ 1,987 $ 1,727 Tax fees (3) $ 82 $ 114 All other fees (4) $ 9 $ 8 Total $ 13,111 $ 13,515 (1) Represents aggregate fees for professional services rendered in connection with annual financial statement audits, audits of our internal control over financial reporting, preparation of comfort letters and consents related to SEC registration statements, quarterly review of financial statements, and for services related to local statutory audits. (2) Represents aggregate fees for assurance and audit-related services (but not included in the audit fees set forth above). The assurance and audit-related services include review of internal controls for selected information systems and business units (Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagement No. 18 and International Standard on Assurance Engagement No. 3402 audits). (3) Represents aggregate fees for tax services in connection with the preparation of tax returns, other tax compliance services, and tax planning services. (4) Represents fees for eXtensible Business Reporting Language services and subscription fees for an accounting research tool. Consistent with SEC and PCAOB requirements regarding auditor independence, the Audit and Risk Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting the compensation for, and overseeing the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. In accordance with its charter and the Audit and Risk Committee’s Pre-Approval Policy, the Audit and Risk Committee is required to pre-approve all audit and internal control-related services, audit-related services, and permissible non-audit services, including the terms thereof, to be performed for us by our independent registered public accounting firm. During fiscal year 2023, all services KPMG provided to the Company were pre-approved by the Audit and Risk Committee in accordance with applicable SEC regulations and the Pre-Approval Policy, and the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed and discussed the documentation KPMG supplied to it as to tax services and the potential effect of the provision thereof on KPMG’s independence. To further help with the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm, we have adopted policies and procedures relating to the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm and the hiring of employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm. 2024 Proxy Statement 99 Table of Contents Proposal 4 Proposal 4 – Approval and Adoption of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments As further discussed below, Visa is proposing amendments to the Certificate that will authorize Visa to enable the release and public sale of portions of our Class B common stock in a measured and programmatic fashion through a series of exchange offers. Such sales are currently prohibited by the Certificate until final resolution of the U.S. Covered Litigation (as defined below under History of Visa’s Common Stock ). For the reasons discussed herein, including Visa’s significant progress in resolving the remaining U.S. Covered Litigation and the benefits provided to each class of our common stockholders, the Board believes it is in the best interests of Visa and its stockholders to facilitate this partial release now. **** After consideration, and informed by engagement with holders representing a significant percentage of the outstanding shares of each class of common stock, the Board has unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable, and recommends that our stockholders approve and adopt, the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, which would authorize Visa to conduct one or more exchange offers that would effectively enable the Class B stockholders to exchange and sell portions of their Class B common stock, subject to certain conditions. As discussed herein, the Board has determined that the Exchange Offer Program (as defined below) is in the best interests of all of our stockholders because the program: proactively mitigates potential overhang risk our stockholders face from the eventual release of all transfer restrictions applicable to our Class B common stock as is currently structured; simultaneously provides our Class A and Class C stockholders with economically equivalent protection from the U.S. Covered Litigation; and provides our Class B stockholders with an option for near-term liquidity and potential for better regulatory capital treatment. 100 Table of Contents Proposal 4 Below is an overview of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, which are discussed in detail herein: Overview of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments What is it? • The Class B Exchange Offer Program Amendments would authorize the Exchange Offer Program, which would enable Visa to permit the release of transfer restrictions on portions of Visa’s Class B common stock through a programmatic structure. • The Exchange Offer Program would authorize Visa to conduct one or more exchange offers that would allow Class B stockholders to exchange portions of their Class B common stock into freely tradeable shares, while providing economically equivalent protection to Class A and Class C stockholders from the remaining U.S. Covered Litigation. Why now? • The Class B common stock was created in connection with Visa’s IPO in 2008 to provide protection to Class A and Class C common stockholders from the U.S. Covered Litigation. Class B common stock was originally valued at approximately $8 billion and is now valued at approximately $99 billion, as of November 24, 2023, an increase of 1,185%. • Visa has made significant progress towards resolving the remaining U.S. Covered Litigation, including the recent finalization of the settlement with the damages class. • In the only remaining U.S. Covered Litigation matter, claims representing approximately 90% of the payments volume and interchange at issue have been settled for $6.6 billion. Benefits to our Common Stockholders Class A and Class C Stockholders Class B Stockholders • Makewhole Agreements and Class B common stock provide economically equivalent protection to Class A and Class C stockholders from the remaining U.S. Covered Litigation. • Measured release of Class B common stock through programmatic structure and lock-up provisions mitigates potential overhang risk that otherwise would exist with the current share release provision. • Opportunity to strengthen relationships with Visa’s clients. • Option for near-term liquidity and potential for better regulatory capital treatment. • Opportunity to unlock value that would represent a significant portion of aggregate tangible common equity for U.S. financial institutions. • Choice of participation level to release up to 50% of a holder’s Class B stock in each Exchange Offer. Consideration by the Board and Stockholder Engagement • In consultation with management, the Board undertook a thorough process to evaluate a Potential Exchange Offer Program for the Class B common stock. • Visa conducted extensive outreach to holders of each class of our common stock , including outreach to stockholders representing approximately 58% of our outstanding Class A common stock, 75% of our outstanding Class B common stock and 57% of our outstanding Class C common stock, to solicit feedback on the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments and the proposed Exchange Offer Program. • As a result of efforts by the Board and management, Visa held discussions with stockholders representing a significant percentage of each class of our common stock, including with stockholders representing approximately 41% of our outstanding Class A common stock, 75% of our outstanding Class B common stock and 57% of our outstanding Class C common stock. • Engagement with our stockholders directly informed the Board’s determination that adoption of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments is in the best interests of our Class A, Class B and Class C stockholders and the Board’s recommendation that our stockholders approve the amendments. 2024 Proxy Statement 101 Table of Contents Proposal 4 Transactions Contemplated by the Class B Exchange Offer Program Amendments The Exchange Offer Program The Exchange Offer Program is intended to provide Class B stockholders with additional liquidity, while continuing to maintain economically equivalent protection to holders of Class A and Class C common stock from monetary liability related to the U.S. Covered Litigation. In addition, the Class B Exchange Offer Program is designed to address potential overhang risk by mitigating the downward pressure on our Class A common stock price that could occur if transfer restrictions on all Class B common stock were to be released simultaneously upon final resolution of the U.S. Covered Litigation, as is currently structured in our Certificate. The Class B common stock has been subject to transfer restrictions for over 15 years, substantially longer than Visa and its stockholders expected at the time of the 2008 IPO. The Exchange Offer Program allows for a programmatic and measured release of Class B common stock Illustrative (1) (1) Assumes full participation in each Exchange Offer. The Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments would redenominate Visa’s Class B common stock as Class B-1 common stock (which would otherwise remain identical to the previous Class B common stock). In addition, subject to certain conditions, the amendments would authorize Visa to conduct a series of exchange offers that would comprise an initial exchange offer (Initial Exchange Offer) and up to three successive exchange offers (each, a Successive Exchange Offer), that would allow Class B stockholders to exchange portions of their Class B shares into freely tradeable shares under certain conditions, while providing economically equivalent protection to Class A and Class C stockholders from the U.S. Covered Litigation through a combination of the remaining Class B shares and makewhole agreements (collectively, the Exchange Offer Program). 102 Table of Contents Proposal 4 The Initial Exchange Offer The mechanics of the Initial Exchange Offer (1) To determine the number of shares of Class C common stock received, multiply half of the Class B-1 common stock exchanged by the current Class B Conversion Rate to determine the as-converted Class A common stock equivalent; then divide that amount by the Class C Conversion Rate. As shown above under the Initial Exchange Offer, Class B-1 stockholders (formerly Class B stockholders) would be offered the opportunity to tender some or all of their Class B-1 common stock in exchange for a combination of: • Class B-2 common stock , where one newly issued share of Class B-2 common stock will be received for every two shares of Class B-1 common stock tendered in the Exchange Offer. This Class B-2 common stock would be a new class of common stock subject to the same transfer and convertibility restrictions that currently bind Class B stockholders, although future downward adjustments to the rate at which Class B-2 common stock converts into Class A common stock (Class B-2 Conversion Rate) would be accelerated to occur at twice the rate as that applicable to the rate at which Class B-1 common stock converts into Class A common stock (Class B-1 Conversion Rate); and • Class C common stock in an amount equivalent to the value of one share of Class B-1 common stock for every two shares of Class B-1 common stock tendered in the Exchange Offer. This Class C common stock would be the same as is currently outstanding and would be immediately transferable and convertible into shares of Class A common stock, although a portion of this Class C common stock would be subject to temporary contractual transfer restrictions, or “lock-up” agreements. By participating in the Initial Exchange Offer, each holder of Class B-1 common stock would effectively have the ability to sell up to half of its Class B-1 common stock into the public market in the form of Class C common stock, which upon sale is convertible into Class A common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate. Successive Exchange Offers Once the Initial Exchange Offer is completed, Visa would be authorized, at its discretion and subject to the conditions below, to conduct up to three Successive Exchange Offers that would have the effect of releasing the transfer restrictions on up to half of the applicable Class B common stock issued in a previous exchange offer. In exchange for the tendered Class B common stock (the applicable Class B-X common stock), Visa would issue (x) shares of a successive class of Class B common stock (the applicable Class B-Y common stock) (for example, in the first Successive Exchange Offer, Class B-3 common stock would be issued in exchange for Class B-2 common stock) in an amount equivalent to half of the Class B-X common stock tendered in exchange and (y) shares of Class C common stock in an amount equivalent to half of the value of the Class B-X common stock tendered in the Exchange Offer. 2024 Proxy Statement 103 Table of Contents Proposal 4 Each successive class of Class B common stock issued in a Successive Exchange Offer would be subject to the same transfer and convertibility restrictions as the Class B common stock that is currently outstanding. However, in order to maintain equivalent exposure to the U.S. Covered Litigation liability, future downward conversion rate adjustments to each new class of Class B-Y common stock (the applicable Class B-Y Conversion Rate) would be accelerated to occur at twice the rate as that applicable to the Class B-X common stock tendered in exchange (the applicable Class B-X Conversion Rate). For example, in the first Successive Exchange Offer, future downward adjustments to the conversion rate for Class B-3 common stock would occur at the twice the rate as applicable to Class B-2 common stock (or four times the rate as applicable to Class B-1 common stock). Conditions for Successive Potential Exchange Offers • Reduction of 50% or more of the interchange at issue in unresolved claims for damages in the U.S. Covered Litigation • More than twelve months from preceding Exchange Offer • Is at the discretion of Visa For example, after Visa conducts the initial Successive Exchange Offer directed to holders of Class B-1 common stock in which these holders are offered the opportunity to receive Class B-2 common stock, Visa could not offer the holders of Class B-2 common stock the opportunity to exchange the Class B-2 Common Stock for Class B-3 common stock until (i) at least one year had elapsed from the initial Successive Exchange Offer that resulted in the initial issuance of the Class B-2 common stock and (ii) the estimated interchange reimbursement fees at issue in unresolved claims for damages in the U.S. Covered Litigation had been reduced by 50% or more. With respect to the first condition for Successive Exchange Offers, Visa will use estimates of the interchange reimbursement fees at issue in respect of any unresolved claims seeking damages in any of the U.S. Covered Litigation as of October 1, 2023 for the purpose of determining whether Visa is authorized to conduct a Successive Exchange Offer. Visa’s current estimate of such interchange reimbursement fees as of October 1, 2023 is approximately $49.6 billion. This estimate does not include claims in certain purported indirect purchaser class actions or any claims of merchants serviced by opt outs that are payment processors and facilitators. The First Successive Exchange Offer The mechanics of the first Successive Exchange Offer (1) To determine the number of shares of Class C common stock received, multiply half of the Class B-2 common stock exchanged by the current Class B-2 Conversion Rate to determine the as-converted Class A common stock equivalent; then divide that amount by the Class C Conversion Rate. If not all Class B common stock was tendered in the Initial Exchange Offer or a previous Successive Exchange Offer, Visa would also be authorized to conduct additional Exchange Offers for the untendered Class B common stock remaining. Any additional Exchange Offer for untendered Class B common stock would occur on the same terms as the Initial Exchange Offer or previous Successive Exchange Offer, as applicable, and is subject to Visa’s discretion. 104 Table of Contents Proposal 4 Conditions to Participate in the Exchange Offer Program As a condition to participation in the Initial Exchange Offer and any Successive Exchange Offer, each participating Class B stockholder would be required to enter into a separate agreement with Visa, substantially in the form attached as Annex B to this proxy statement (a Makewhole Agreement) to reimburse Visa in cash for the portion of any future deposit into the U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account that, but for the holder’s participation in the applicable Exchange Offer, would have been absorbed by such holder through downward adjustments to the applicable Class B-X Conversion Rate of the Class B-X common stock tendered in the Exchange Offer if, as a result of the deposit, the as-converted value of the Class B-Y common stock it received in the Exchange Offer becomes or is already less than zero, but the applicable Class B-X Conversion Rate remains greater than or equal to zero. For example, following the Initial Exchange Offer and prior to any Successive Exchange Offer, a payment obligation would arise under the Makewhole Agreements for the Class B-2 common stock if a deposit to the U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account causes the as-converted value of the Class B-2 common stock to fall below zero and if, following such deposit, the as-converted value of the Class B-1 common stock remains equal to or greater than zero. In addition, certain parent entities of the participating Class B stockholder (each, a Parent Guarantor) would be obligated to execute the Makewhole Agreement and agree to unconditionally guarantee the participating holder’s payment obligations. Subject to certain exceptions that apply to certain holders to facilitate compliance with applicable federal banking regulations, each beneficial owner of 50% or more of a participating holder’s or Parent Guarantor’s equity interests must execute the Makewhole Agreement. Due to the varying applicability of federal banking regulations among Visa’s Class B stockholders, the extent of eligible Parent Guarantors will differ for participating holders. However, each participating holder would receive, and must execute, the same form of Makewhole Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Makewhole Agreement, each participating Class B stockholder would agree to temporary transfer restrictions with respect to any Class C common stock received in the applicable Exchange Offer.

Pursuant to the Certificate, holders of Class B and Class C common stock are prohibited from holding Class A common stock for their own accounts. As of November 24, 2023, approximately 1.6 billion shares of Class A common stock were outstanding. • Class B common stock is held predominantly by U.S. financial institutions, or their affiliates, that are current or former members of Visa U.S.A. Inc. As discussed below, each share of Class B common stock is convertible into Class A common stock at a conversion rate (Class B Conversion Rate) that is adjusted downward when Visa makes a deposit into the escrow account from which monetary liabilities arising from the U.S. Covered Litigation are payable. Under the current Certificate, Class B common stock is subject to transfer and convertibility restrictions until the final resolution of all U.S. Covered Litigation. As of November 24, 2023, approximately 245 million shares of Class B common stock were outstanding, which at the Class B Conversion Rate of 1.5875 would be convertible into approximately 390 million shares of Class A common stock. • Class C common stock is held predominantly by financial institution clients of Visa, or their affiliates, that are located outside of the United States, as well as by other persons that, pursuant to the Certificate, are prohibited from holding Class A 2024 Proxy Statement 105 Table of Contents Proposal 4 common stock. Each share of Class C common stock is convertible into four shares of Class A common stock (Class C Conversion Rate). Class C common stock is not currently subject to transfer restrictions under the Certificate and automatically converts into Class A common stock upon transfer to an eligible holder of Class A common stock. As of November 24, 2023, approximately 9.4 million shares of Class C common stock were outstanding, which at the Class C Conversion Rate of 4.000 would be convertible into approximately 37.7 million shares of Class A common stock. Our Class B common stock was created as part of our IPO to provide protection to the Class A and Class C common stock from the monetary liability for the U.S. Covered Litigation, which it has successfully done since 2008. At the time of our IPO, Visa established the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan (Responsibility Plan) to implement such protections with respect to the U.S. Covered Litigation, which consists, collectively, of a number of matters that have been settled or otherwise fully or substantially resolved, and the ongoing Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL), In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation . The MDL is composed primarily of a damages class, claims brought by merchants that opted out of the damages class, and an injunctive relief class. The MDL cases challenge Visa’s purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, “no surcharge” and honor-all-card rules, alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees, and the reorganization and IPO, and were brought under federal antitrust laws and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. As part of the Responsibility Plan, Visa established a U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account from which any settlements or judgments relating to the U.S. Covered Litigation would be payable. When Visa funds the U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account, any outstanding Class B common stock is subject to dilution through downward adjustments to the Class B Conversion Rate, making each share of Class B common stock convertible into fewer shares of Class A common stock. This mechanic allows Visa to fund the U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account through the equivalent of a contribution of Class A common stock from the Class B stockholders to Visa. Since 2008, the Class B common stock has been subject to transfer restrictions that were implemented in light of the Responsibility Plan that prohibit the conversion of the Class B common stock into Class A common stock. Specifically, the transfer restrictions applicable to Class B common stock disallow its conversion and public sale until the final resolution of the U.S. Covered Litigation. Accordingly, under the current Certificate, all shares of Class B common stock will become convertible into and able to be publicly sold as shares of Class A common stock upon the final resolution of the U.S. Covered Litigation (Escrow Termination Date), based on the Class B Conversion Rate in effect at such time. As part of the Responsibility Plan, Visa also entered into a Loss Sharing Agreement between Visa International Service Association, Visa U.S.A., Inc. and certain Visa member banks. The Loss Sharing Agreement provides for the indemnification of the Visa parties with respect to certain matters. Under the Loss Sharing Agreement, if all available funds in the U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account are insufficient to satisfy a Visa litigation obligation, and the as-converted value of the Class B common stock has reached zero each member bank party to the Loss Sharing Agreement is required to contribute an amount equal to the unsatisfied Visa litigation obligation multiplied by the party’s then-current membership proportion. The Class B Conversion Rate adjustment mechanism and transfer restrictions described above were designed to cause monetary liability for the U.S. Covered Litigation to be borne by Class B stockholders, who, prior to the IPO, were the U.S.-based owners of the Visa enterprise. Visa has settled claims representing approximately 90% of the payments volume and interchange at issue in the MDL 1 , the only remaining matter in the U.S. Covered Litigation, and to date Visa has paid through the Responsibility Plan approximately $6.6 billion for settlements in that remaining matter. However, during that same time, the as-converted pre-tax value of the Class B common stock has appreciated from approximately $8 billion to over $99 billion as of November 24, 2023, an increase of 1,185%. Because the final resolution of all U.S. Covered Litigation has not yet occurred, the transfer restrictions on our Class B common stock have now been in place for over 15 years, substantially longer than Visa and the Class B stockholders contemplated at the time of our IPO. In light of these developments, Visa’s Board and management have undertaken an evaluation of the appropriate steps to chart a programmatic and measured course of action that will benefit all of Visa’s stockholders while maintaining economically 1 Interchange and payments volume represented include (i) estimated interchange and payments volume from 2004-2018 for the following populations: individual settlements prior to the damages class settlement, merchants included in the damages class settlement, and merchants who opted out of the damages class and settled their claims; and (ii) estimated interchange and payments volume from 2004-2022 for unresolved damages class opt-outs. For unresolved claims by damages class opt-outs, estimated interchange and payments volume from 2004-2022 is utilized because claims are based on transactions up to when a claim is resolved; the payments volume and interchange at issue for unresolved claims will continue to increase. 106 Table of Contents Proposal 4 equivalent protection for Class A and Class C stockholders against monetary liability for the remaining U.S. Covered Litigation in accordance with the Responsibility Plan. The Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments The relevant sections of the Certificate to be amended are set forth in Annex A. This summary of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to Annex A. Implementation of the Exchange Offer Program will require several amendments to our Certificate, including: • Article IV, Section 4.1 will be amended to reflect the redenomination of the Class B common stock into Class B-1 common stock, to create new Class B-2 common stock, Class B-3 common stock, Class B-4 common stock and Class B-5 common stock and to clarify that all references to “Class B Common Stock” will be deemed to refer to and include all Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock, Class B-3 common stock, Class B-4 common stock and Class B-5 common stock. In addition, Section 4.1 will provide that the terms “Class B-X Common Stock” and “Class B-Y Common Stock” together refer to any pair of consecutively numbered classes of Class B Common Stock (with the Class B-X Common Stock referring to the class of Class B Common Stock with the lower number of the pair and the Class B-Y Common Stock referring to the class of the Class B Common Stock with the higher number of the pair). • Article IV, Section 4.7 will be amended by adding a new paragraph (c) that clarifies that holders of all classes of Class B Common Stock will vote as a single class on all matters upon which such holders are entitled to vote, except with respect to amendments to certain provisions of the Certificate or as otherwise required by applicable law. • Article IV, Section 4.14 will be amended by adding a new paragraph (d) that provides that Visa will not take any action with respect to any class of Class B-X common stock (i.e., the class of Class B Common Stock with the lower number of any given pair of outstanding Class B common stock) without taking equivalent action to the corresponding Class B-Y common stock that ensures, among other things, that following the applicable Exchange Offer resulting in the issuance of the Class B-Y common stock, downward adjustments to the Class B-Y Conversion Rate occur at double the rate of adjustments to the corresponding Class B-X Conversion Rate. • Article IV, Section 4.23 will be amended by adding a new paragraph (c) that sets forth the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer Program, including (i) the consideration to be issued in any Exchange Offer, (ii) the requirement for a participating Class B stockholder to execute and deliver the Makewhole Agreement with respect to the Class B-Y common stock issued in an Exchange Offer, and (iii) the conditions that must be satisfied before Visa can conduct a Successive Exchange Offer for any new class of Class B-Y common stock (each as described herein). • Article IV, Section 4.26(a) will be amended to provide (i) that Visa may make deposits into the U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account so long as the Class B-1 Conversion Rate after such action remains equal to or greater than zero, even if such action reduces any Class B-Y Conversion Rate below zero, and (ii) for the treatment of a transaction that causes the Class B-Y Conversion Rate to fall below or, upon the occurrence of the Escrow Termination Date, rise above, zero. • The definition of “Applicable Conversion Rate” will be amended to provide the calculation of the applicable Class B-Y Conversion Rates as described herein. Purpose and Effect of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments Under the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, the Class B common stock will be redenominated as Class B-1 common stock, and Visa will be authorized to conduct the Initial Exchange Offer, in which each Class B-1 stockholder will have the opportunity to exchange some or all of its Class B-1 common stock, and up to three Successive Exchange Offers, in which Class B stockholders would have the opportunity to exchange some or all of the class of Class B common stock it received in the applicable Exchange Offer for the next preceding class of Class B common stock. Under each Exchange Offer, for every two shares of Class B-X common stock tendered, a participating holder would receive (i) one newly issued share of Class B-Y common stock (the successive class of Class B common stock) and (ii) newly issued Class C common stock in an amount equivalent to one share of Class B-X common stock (based on the respective amounts of Class A common stock into which the applicable Class B-X common stock and Class C common stock would be convertible as of the completion of the Exchange Offer). In order to participate in any Exchange Offer, a participating Class B stockholder, together 2024 Proxy Statement 107 Table of Contents Proposal 4 with any applicable Parent Guarantor thereof, will be required to execute and deliver to Visa a separate Makewhole Agreement, substantially in the form attached as Annex B to this proxy statement, as described herein. Collectively, the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, the consummation of the Initial Exchange Offer and any Successive Exchange Offer, and the execution of the Makewhole Agreements described below are designed to benefit all Visa stockholders by: (i) providing economically equivalent protection to Class A and Class C stockholders from the remaining U.S. Covered Litigation, (ii) providing a programmatic and measured structure for releasing portions of Class B common stock thereby mitigating potential overhang risk, and (iii) providing our Class B stockholders—large and small financial institution clients—with the opportunity for partial liquidity after having been restricted from making public sales for over 15 years. As shown in the following table, after the completion of the Exchange Offer Program, the value of the protection provided to our Class A and Class C stockholders from U.S. Covered Litigation would remain equivalent to the value of the Class B common stock prior to the Exchange Offer, while the potential overhang risk could lessen as compared to the amount of overhang risk under our current Certificate provisions. As noted above, each Successive Exchange Offer is also predicated on the necessary reduction in litigation exposure as measured by “interchange at issue” in the U.S. Covered Litigation. Under Current Certificate Provisions Post-Initial Exchange Offer (1) Post-Exchange Offer Program (2) Value of Protection from U.S. Covered Litigation $99 billion (3) of coverage, composed of shares of Class B common stock, plus Loss Sharing Agreement $99 billion (3 ) of coverage, composed of $49.5 billion (3) shares of Class B common stock and $49.5 billion (3) under Makewhole Agreements, plus Loss Sharing Agreement $99 billion (3) of coverage, composed of $6.2 billion (3) shares of Class B common stock and $92.8 billion (3) under Makewhole Agreements, plus Loss Sharing Agreement Amount of Potential Overhang Risk Upon Final Resolution of U.S. Covered Litigation (4) $99 billion (3) $49.5 billion (3) $6.2 billion (3) (1) Assuming full participation in the Initial Exchange Offer.

(4) Assumes all shares of Class C common stock issued in an Exchange Offer are sold upon completion of the Exchange Offer. 108 Table of Contents Proposal 4 Visa Common Stock Received in each Exchange Offer The Class B-Y common stock received by participating holders in the Initial Exchange Offer and each Successive Exchange Offer will be a new class of stock that is subject to the same transfer and convertibility restrictions that currently apply to the Class B common stock. As an illustrative example of what each holder would receive in the Initial Exchange Offer, let us assume there are three stockholders that each hold 100,000 Class B shares, the Class B Conversion Rate is 1.5875, Class C Conversion Rate is 4.000, and the Class A share price on the date of exchange is $254.30. Their holdings after the Initial Exchange Offer, based on their participation level, would be as follows: Option 1: Class B stockholder does not elect to participate in Initial Exchange Offer Option 2: Class B stockholder elects to fully participate in Initial Exchange Offer Option 3: Class B stockholder elects to exchange 1 ⁄ 2 of shares in Initial Exchange Offer Shares Value ($) Shares Value ($) Shares Value ($) B 100,0000 40,370,125 (1) 100,000 40,370,125 (1) 100,000 40,370,125 (1) All Class B shares are redenominated as Class B - 1 shares B1 100,000 40,370,125 (1) 100,000 40,370,125 (1) 100,000 40,370,125 (1) Exchange 0 0 100,000 40,370,125 (1) 50,000 20,185,063 B-1 100,000 40,370,125 (1) - - 50,000 20,185,063 B-2 - - 50,000 20,185,063 25,000 10,092,532 C - - 19,843 (2) 20,185,063 (4) 9,921 (3) 10,092,532 (4) In every scenario, total value ($) does not change Figures may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. (1) Aggregate value: multiply 100,000 shares of Class B common stock by Class B Conversion Rate (1.5875) to determine as-converted Class A common stock equivalent (158,750); then multiply by share price based on the $254.30 NYSE closing price of Class A common stock on November 24, 2023. (2) To determine the number of shares of Class C common stock received: multiply 50,000 shares of Class B-1 common stock (1/2 of B-1s exchanged) by the Class B Conversion Rate (1.5875) to determine the as-converted Class A common stock equivalent (79,375 shares); then divide that amount by 4 (the Class C Conversion Rate). (3) To determine the number of shares of Class C common stock received: multiply 25,000 shares of Class B-1 common stock (1/2 of B-1s exchanged) by the Class B Conversion Rate (1.5875) to determine the as-converted Class A common stock equivalent (39,687 shares); then divide that amount by 4 (the Class C Conversion Rate). (4) Includes cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. Immediately following completion of the Initial Exchange Offer and each Successive Exchange Offer, the Class B-Y Conversion Rate for the class of Class B-Y common stock issued in the Exchange Offer will equal the Class B-X Conversion Rate for the Class B-X common stock tendered in the Exchange Offer in effect immediately prior to the Exchange Offer’s completion. However, following any future deposits made to the U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account, future downward adjustments to the applicable Class B-Y Conversion Rate will be accelerated to occur at twice the rate as that applicable to the class of Class B-X common stock tendered in exchange. As of November 24, 2023, there were 245,513,385 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, which had a market value of more than $99 billion on an as-converted basis based on Visa’s Class A closing share price and the Class B Conversion Rate on November 24, 2023. Assuming full participation, upon completion of the Initial Exchange Offer, we would have an aggregate of approximately 123 million shares of Class B-2 common stock outstanding, which, based on the same Class A share price and conversion rate, would have a market value of more than $49.5 billion on an as-converted basis. This as-converted market value would remain available to absorb liability for the U.S. Covered Litigation through the Class B-2 Conversion Rate adjustment mechanism applicable to the Class B-2 common stock. Class C common stock is not currently subject to transfer restrictions under the Certificate and automatically converts to four shares of Class A common stock upon a sale into the public market. However, to mitigate the potential market disruption that could occur upon the immediate sale of the Class C common stock issued in an Exchange Offer, the Makewhole Agreements 2024 Proxy Statement 109 Table of Contents Proposal 4 will contain transfer restrictions that will only allow a participating holder to sell up to one-third of the Class C common stock it receives in the applicable Exchange Offer within the first 45 days following the applicable Exchange Offer, up to two-thirds within the first 90 days following the applicable Exchange Offer, and the balance after 90 days following the applicable Exchange Offer. Assuming full participation in the Initial Exchange Offer, based on the current Class B Conversion Rate, Visa would issue approximately 48.7 million shares of Class C common stock in the Exchange Offer, which would be convertible, following the expiration of the Makewhole Agreement’s transfer restrictions into approximately 194.9 million shares of Class A common stock that may be sold publicly prior to the Escrow Termination Date. Makewhole Agreements Class B stockholders who elect to participate in any Exchange Offer will be required to execute and deliver a Makewhole Agreement with respect to the Class B-Y common stock issued to it in an Exchange Offer. Under each Makewhole Agreement, the participating holder will agree to reimburse Visa for the portion of any future deposit into the U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account that, but for the holder’s participation in the applicable Exchange Offer, would have been absorbed by such holder through downward adjustments to the conversion rate of the class of Class B-X common stock tendered in the applicable Exchange Offer if, as a result of the deposit, the as-converted value of the Class B-Y common stock it received in the applicable Exchange Offer becomes or is already less than zero but the as-converted value of the applicable Class B-X common stock remains greater than or equal to zero. A Class B stockholder who participates in more than one Exchange Offer would be party to multiple Makewhole Agreements, one for each Exchange Offer in which the stockholder participates. However, a holder who is party to Makewhole Agreements for more than one class of Class B-Y common stock would only be obligated to reimburse Visa under the Makewhole Agreement that corresponds to a single class of Class B-Y common stock at any given time. So long as the Class B-X Conversion Rate with respect to any Class B-X and Class B-Y common stock pair remains greater than or equal to zero, payment obligations would only arise under the Makewhole Agreements for the corresponding Class B-Y common stock. If the Class B-X Conversion Rate in such Class B-X and Class B-Y common stock pair falls to zero, payment obligations under the Makewhole Agreements relating to such Class B-Y common stock would terminate, and potential payment obligations would arise under the Makewhole Agreements relating to the Class B-X common stock. In this scenario, the Class B-X common stock would effectively become the Class B-Y common stock with respect to the preceding Class B-X and Class B-Y common stock pair. The obligation to reimburse Visa under successive Makewhole Agreements would continue in this manner until the Class B-1 Conversion Rate reaches zero. At such time, the Class B-1 common stock would have lost all value and, following the exhaustion of the U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account, the parties to the Loss Sharing Agreement would be obligated to indemnify Visa under the Loss Sharing Agreement. Using the Makewhole Agreement corresponding to the Class B-2 common stock issued in the Initial Exchange Offer as an example, for each share of Class B-2 common stock issued to a Class B-1 stockholder in the Initial Exchange Offer, the makewhole payment obligation would equal two times the reduction in value that a single share of Class B-1 common stock would have experienced following a deposit into the U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account. The loss absorption capacity attributable to the Class B common stock fluctuates with changes in the price of Class A common stock. Assuming a constant Class B Conversion Rate, changes in the price of Class A common stock will cause proportional changes in the total loss absorption capacity of Class B common stock. Upon the effectiveness of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments and completion of the Initial Exchange Offer and any Successive Exchange Offer, the total loss absorption capacity of any outstanding class of Class B-Y common stock, and the total potential makewhole payment obligations under the Makewhole Agreements, will similarly fluctuate with changes in the market price of our Class A common stock. Because there is no cap on the Class A common stock price, as long as the Class B-1 Conversion Rate is greater than zero, there is no cap on the value of Class B-1 common stock. Therefore, until all U.S. Covered Litigation has been resolved, there is no dollar cap on the amount of payments that a participating holder and its Parent Guarantors may be obligated to make under its Makewhole Agreement. Authority to Repurchase Class B Common Stock Visa is authorized under the Certificate, and will remain authorized following the effectiveness of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock, including Class B common stock, Class B-1 common stock and any new class of Class B-Y common stock issued in an Exchange Offer. We may in the future 110 Table of Contents Proposal 4 conduct repurchases of such stock, including through one or more tender offers, as we deem appropriate based on, among other things, the status of the U.S. Covered Litigation, our estimates of remaining monetary liability with respect thereto and Visa’s assessment at the time of the potential loss-absorption capacity of the remaining Class B common stock. Any such repurchases, which would reduce the aggregate loss-absorption capacity of the Class B common stock, would occur upon the terms and at the prices as we may determine in our discretion. Background and Reasons for the Class B Exchange Offer Program Amendments In the ordinary course of business, Visa’s Board and management regularly review our governing documents and oversee risk management, including risks related to legal matters. In connection with such reviews, the Board and management have discussed whether it would be in the best interests of Visa and its stockholders to release portions of the Class B common stock from the transfer restrictions to which they are currently subject. The Class B common stock has been subject to transfer restrictions for over 15 years, substantially longer than Visa and the Class B stockholders expected at the time of the 2008 IPO, and with significant progress towards resolving the remaining U.S. Covered Litigation, including the finalization of the settlement with the damages class, we believe now is an appropriate time to adopt the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments. After consideration of information and analysis prepared by Visa management (with input from outside advisors) regarding the remaining U.S. Covered Litigation, the current as-converted market value of Class B common stock, and the impact that a one-time conversion of up to all outstanding shares of Class B common stock may have on our Class A and Class C stockholders, the Board has determined that adoption of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments is in the best interest of all of our stockholders. Stockholder Engagement In consultation with the Board, management initiated a dedicated process of engagement with stockholders related to the Exchange Offer Program, and thereafter finalized the terms of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, including the terms and conditions of the Makewhole Agreement. This evaluation included engagement with holders of each class of our common stock, as well as other Visa stakeholders, to discuss the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments and the proposed Exchange Offer Program and solicit feedback for consideration by management and the Board. Visa conducted outreach to Class A stockholders representing approximately 58% of outstanding Class A common stock, Class B stockholders representing approximately 75% of outstanding Class B common stock and Class C stockholders representing approximately 57% of outstanding Class C common stock. Discussions were held with all stockholders across the three classes who expressed interest to engage with Visa on this matter, totaling Class A stockholders representing approximately 41% of outstanding Class A common stock, Class B stockholders representing approximately 75% of outstanding Class B common stock, and Class C stockholders representing approximately 57% of outstanding Class C common stock. Engagement with stockholders informed the Board’s decision made to recommend the approval and adoption of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments. During our engagement discussions with stockholders regarding the Exchange Offer Program, stockholders provided feedback that supporting Visa’s stock price through share repurchases would be viewed favorably. The Board took that feedback into consideration and consistent with prior practices, has authorized a new $25 billion Class A common stock share repurchase program, providing multi-year flexibility, that was announced on October 24, 2023. Following the evaluation process, the Board declared advisable and approved the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments and resolved to (i) submit the approval and the adoption of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments to stockholders of Visa at the Annual Meeting, and (ii) recommend that Visa stockholders approve and adopt the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments at the Annual Meeting. 2024 Proxy Statement 111 Table of Contents Proposal 4 Key Board Considerations In reaching its determinations, the Board consulted with Visa’s independent advisors, and considered various information and factors described below. Among the key information and factors considered by the Board were: The Exchange Offer Program would provide Class A and Class C stockholders with economically equivalent protection from the U.S. Covered Litigation. The Exchange Offer Program is designed to mitigate potential overhang risk for Class A and Class C stockholders by providing for the programmatic and measured release of portions of Class B common stock and by imposing temporary restrictions to manage the conversion and transfer of participating holders’ Class C common stock. Visa has made significant progress to resolve the remaining U.S. Covered Litigation . The release of transfer restrictions applicable to portions of the Class B common stock would permit Class B stockholders to realize a portion of Visa’s post-IPO value creation and provides the opportunity to strengthen client relationships with Visa’s Class B stockholders. • The Exchange Offer Program would provide Class A and Class C stockholders with economically equivalent protection from the U.S. Covered Litigation . For the past 15 years, the Responsibility Plan has insulated Class A and Class C stockholders from monetary liability related to U.S. Covered Litigation. When developing the Exchange Offer Program, the Board and management focused on designing a program that preserved an economically equivalent level of protection for Class A and Class C stockholders that is comparable with the Responsibility Plan in place today. Visa’s Board believes the Exchange Offer Program achieves this economically equivalent protection, subject to the credit risk of Class B stockholders and their respective Parent Guarantors that are party to Makewhole Agreements, as well as possible delays in collection under the Makewhole Agreements. As described above, Class B stockholders who elect to participate in any Exchange Offer will be required to execute and deliver a Makewhole Agreement with respect to the Class B-Y common stock issued in such Exchange Offer, pursuant to which the participating Class B stockholder will agree to reimburse Visa for the portion of any future deposit into the U.S. Covered Litigation escrow account that, but for the holder’s participation in the applicable Exchange Offer, would have been absorbed by such holder through downward adjustments to the conversion rate of the class of Class B-X common stock tendered in the applicable Exchange Offer. When evaluating the protections provided under the Exchange Offer Program and determining that the protections are in the best interests of our Class A and Class C stockholders, the Board considered the credit and collection risk associated with the Makewhole Agreements, that the Class B stockholders are predominantly U.S. financial institutions that are generally considered creditworthy, obligations under the Makewhole Agreements would be guaranteed by such holders’ respective Parent Guarantors, and that payments under each Makewhole Agreement will only be required if the as-converted value of the Class B-Y common stock received in the applicable Exchange Offer is first reduced to zero. The Board additionally considered the viability of alternative options, such as repurchasing Class B common stock, which is and will remain permitted under the Certificate (regardless of whether the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments are adopted), but which would reduce the aggregate loss-absorption capacity of the Class B common stock. See Purpose and Effect of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments . In light of the foregoing considerations, the Board and Visa management believe that the Makewhole Agreements, when combined with the conversion rate adjustment mechanism applicable to each class of Class B-Y common stock received in an Exchange Offer, together with the market value of and conversion rate adjustment mechanism applicable to any Class B-X common stock not exchanged in any Exchange Offer (which will remain available to absorb liability for the U.S. Covered Litigation), maintain a level of protection to the Class A and Class C stockholders that is economically equivalent to the protection that exists today. • The Exchange Offer Program is designed to mitigate potential overhang risk for Class A and Class C stockholders by providing for a programmatic structure to release portions of Class B common stock and by imposing temporary restrictions to manage the conversion and transfer of participating holders’ Class C common stock . Under the Certificate’s current transfer restrictions, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock will be simultaneously released on the Escrow Termination Date, rendering them convertible into transferable shares of 112 Table of Contents Proposal 4 Class A common stock. Since our IPO in 2008, the aggregate market value of the outstanding Class B common stock has increased substantially. The simultaneous release of the transfer restrictions applicable to shares representing such significant value would result in a significant amount of Class A common stock becoming available for public sale and may thus impose considerable downward pressure on the trading price of the Class A common stock. Accordingly, the Board and Visa management have developed the Exchange Offer Program with an eye toward reducing such market-based risks for our Class A and Class C stockholders. The Exchange Offer Program reduces potential overhang risk in two respects. First, depending on the number of Class B common stock tendered in the Initial Exchange Offer and any Successive Exchange Offer, the Exchange Offer Program would reduce the amount of outstanding Class B common stock eligible for conversion and sale upon the Escrow Termination Date. Second, the transfer restrictions in the Makewhole Agreements would manage the conversion and transferability of the Class C common stock issued in the Initial Exchange Offer and any Successive Exchange Offer. We believe these protections will mitigate the potential overhang risk and market impact associated with the simultaneous release of all outstanding Class B common stock upon the Escrow Termination Date, as currently contemplated under our Certificate. • Visa has made significant progress to resolve the remaining U.S. Covered Litigation. The transfer restrictions on the Class B common stock have remained in place significantly longer than Visa and the Class B stockholders anticipated at the time of our 2008 IPO. While Visa cannot predict when the U.S. Covered Litigation will ultimately be resolved, Visa has continued to make progress toward the final resolution of all outstanding claims. The MDL is composed primarily of a damages class, claims brought by merchants that opted out of the damages class, and an injunctive relief class. As announced on March 15, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the 2018 settlement agreement with the damages class, as previously approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in 2019. Because no settlement objector sought review of the Court of Appeals’ decision, the 2018 damages class settlement is now final. In addition, Visa has continued to make significant progress in settling the claims of plaintiffs that opted out of the damages class. Inclusive of individual settlements prior to the 2018 damages class settlement, the 2018 damages class settlement, and the settled opt-outs from 2004 to 2018, Visa has settled claims representing approximately 90% of the payments volume and interchange at issue in the MDL, and to date Visa has paid through the Responsibility Plan approximately $6.6 billion as part of those settlements. With the final approval of the damages class settlement, our remaining potential monetary liability under the U.S. Covered Litigation is primarily related to unsettled merchant claims brought by plaintiffs that opted out of the damages class. Recent settlements have ranged from approximately 3-8% of a merchant’s applicable interchange from 2004 to 2018. If there is no settlement with these merchants, the range of remaining damages exposure based upon merchant claims is approximately $25-$35 billion through calendar year 2022, prior to any trebling, undiscounted, and before any challenge to the claim is addressed by a court. In the future, this amount could exceed the as-converted value of the outstanding Class B common stock. For illustrative purposes only, if we applied the approximate 3-8% settlement range to the unresolved and outstanding interchange from 2004 through calendar year 2022, our approximation of the remaining settlement value would be between $1.4-4 billion, and the escrow balance available for settlements and judgments was $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2023. • The release of transfer restrictions applicable to portions of the Class B common stock would permit Class B stockholders to realize a portion of Visa’s post-IPO value creation and provides an opportunity to strengthen our client relationships with Class B stockholders. Since our IPO in 2008, Visa has created significant value for stockholders but, because the final resolution of all U.S. Covered Litigation has not yet occurred, Class B stockholders have been unable to fully capitalize on that value creation. Importantly, most Class B stockholders are also Visa’s long-term clients and primary commercial partners. The Exchange Offer Program would provide participating Class B stockholders with near-term liquidity with respect to portions of their Class B common stock and, as a result, potentially better regulatory capital treatment. Large and small financial institution clients who hold our Class B common stock would have the ability to unlock value that would represent a significant portion of tangible common equity, representing an opportunity to strengthen client relationships and providing value for all stockholders. In addition, Visa does not anticipate adverse tax consequences for Class A or C stockholders, or for Class B stockholders that do not participate in an Exchange Offer, as a result of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments or the Exchange Offer Program. The intended U.S. federal income tax treatment for holders participating in the Initial Exchange Offer will be more fully described in the documentation provided in connection with the Initial Exchange Offer. See Regulatory Matters; Additional Information below. 2024 Proxy Statement 113 Table of Contents Proposal 4 In reaching its determinations and recommendations with respect to the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, the Board also considered the following potential adverse consequences, risks and countervailing factors: • Credit and collection risk of the Class B stockholders associated with early release. When evaluating the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, the Board considered the credit and collection risk associated with potential payments under the Makewhole Agreements. Because the Class B stockholders are predominantly U.S. financial institutions that are generally considered creditworthy and obligations under the Makewhole Agreements would be guaranteed by such holders’ respective Parent Guarantors, the Board believes that the Makewhole Agreements, when combined with the conversion rate adjustment mechanism applicable to each class of Class B-Y common stock received in an Exchange Offer and the market value of and conversion rate adjustment mechanism applicable to any Class B-X common stock not exchanged in an Exchange Offer, which will remain available to absorb liability for the U.S. Covered Litigation, maintain a level of protection to Visa and thus to the Class A and Class C stockholders that is economically equivalent to the protection that exists today. However, there can be no assurance that the credit and collection risk associated with the Class B stockholders will be economically equivalent under the Exchange Offer Program relative to the Responsibility Plan. • Acceptability of terms to Class B stockholders and outcome of the Exchange Offer Program. The value of the Class B common stock has appreciated significantly since our IPO, and there can be no assurance that the opportunity for partial liquidity provided through the Exchange Offer Program will be viewed as sufficient and acceptable to the Class B stockholders. If our Class B stockholders decide not to participate in the Initial Exchange Offer and/or in any Successive Exchange Offer, the amount of Class B common stock outstanding that would be available for conversion into Class A common stock upon the Escrow Termination Date could remain significant, as a result of which the expected reduction in potential overhang risk for Class A and Class C stockholders could fail to materialize. • The Exchange Offer Program could adversely affect Class A common stock trading prices. There is a risk that the trading price of Class A common stock may decline in connection with the sale of Class C common stock that is issued in connection with each Exchange Offer. However, the Board believes that the potential overhang risk relating to such issuance under the Exchange Offer Program is outweighed by the potential overhang risk relating to the release of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock that would occur upon the Escrow Termination Date, as provided for by the Certificate’s current transfer restrictions. • Impact of announcement, including disclosures that may impact the value of future U.S. Covered Litigation settlements. The uncertainty about the effect of the Exchange Offer Program, regardless of whether it is completed, on the Company’s stakeholders could impair the Company’s ability to operate in the ordinary course of business and could cause changes in existing business relationships. The Board was also aware of the potential for litigation arising in connection with any transaction involving any release of the Class B common stock. However, the Board believes that the Exchange Offer Program is in the best interests of Visa and its stockholders in the long term. In addition, the disclosures made in connection with the proposed adoption of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, including those included in this Proxy Statement, may include information that would not have otherwise been disclosed to the parties in the U.S. Covered Litigation, and which may adversely impact the future value of U.S. Covered Litigation settlements. As a result of these deliberations, the Board concluded that the potential beneficial impacts of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, including the proposed Exchange Offer Program, outweigh the potential adverse consequences, risks and negative factors described above. The discussion of the information and factors that the Board considered, as noted above, in making its determination and recommendation regarding the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments is not intended to be exhaustive but includes the material factors considered. In view of the wide variety of factors considered and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it useful to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weight to these factors. In addition, individual members of the Board may have assigned different weights to different factors. The Board considered this information as a whole and overall considered the information and factors to be favorable to, and in support of, its determinations and recommendations. 114 Table of Contents Proposal 4 Regulatory Matters; Additional Information We are not aware of any material regulatory requirements that must be complied with or regulatory approvals that must be obtained in connection with the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, other than compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and the filing of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Visa expects to file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 in connection with the Initial Exchange Offer if the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments are approved. The registration statement will contain important information about Visa, the Initial Exchange Offer, and related matters, including, without limitation, the expected U.S. federal tax treatment for holders participating in the Initial Exchange Offer. The registration statement can be viewed at sec.gov and our investor relations website at investor.visa.com as soon as reasonably practicable after it is electronically filed with the SEC. Legal Effectiveness of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments Under our Certificate, this proposal requires the affirmative vote of (i) the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, voting as a separate class, (ii) the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, and (iii) the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Class C common stock, voting as a separate class. In addition, the proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Class A, Class B and Class C common stock in the aggregate, which will be achieved if at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of each of the Class A, Class B and Class C common stock, voting together as a single class (with Class B common stock and Class C common stock voting on an as-converted to Class A common stock basis), are voted in favor of the proposal. In each case, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes AGAINST the proposal. If this proposal is approved by each of the classes of common stock individually, as well the classes in the aggregate, as described above, the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of amendment setting forth the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which is currently expected to occur promptly after receiving the requisite approvals. The Board reserves the right to elect to abandon the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments at any time before they become effective, even if they are approved by the stockholders. If this proposal does not receive the requisite approvals, the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments will not be implemented, our Certificate will not be amended, and Class B stockholders will remain subject to the existing transfer restrictions set forth in our Certificate. THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE CLASS B EXCHANGE OFFER PROGRAM CERTIFICATE AMENDMENTS. 2024 Proxy Statement 115 Table of Contents Proposal 5 Proposal 5 — Approval of One or More Adjournments of the Annual Meeting to a Later Date or Time, if Necessary or Appropriate, to Solicit Additional Proxies in Favor of Proposal 4 Visa is seeking stockholder approval of one or more adjournments of the Annual Meeting to a later date or time, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of Proposal 4 in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting to approve the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments. This proposal will be approved and adopted if a majority of the shares of Class A common stock entitled to vote thereon and present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting are voted in favor of such proposal, with abstentions having the same effect as votes AGAINST the proposal. Broker nonvotes, if any, will have no impact on the approval of the proposal. THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL OF ONE OR MORE ADJOURNMENTS OF THE ANNUAL MEETING TO A LATER DATE OR TIME, IF NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE, TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL PROXIES IN FAVOR OF PROPOSAL 4. 116 Table of Contents Proposal 6 Proposal 6 — Stockholder Proposal Requesting that the Board Adopt a Policy to Seek Shareholder Ratification of Certain Termination Pay Arrangements John Chevedden, whose address is 2215 Nelson Ave., No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, has requested that the following proposal be included in this proxy statement and has indicated that he intends to bring such proposal before the Annual Meeting. Mr. Chevedden has submitted documentation indicating that he is the beneficial owner of at least 30 shares of our Class A common stock and has advised Visa that he intends to continue to hold the requisite amount of shares through the date of the Annual Meeting. Mr. Chevedden’s proposal and its related supporting statement are followed by a recommendation from the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors disclaims any responsibility for the content of the proposal and the statement in support of the proposal, which are presented in the form received from the stockholder. Proposal 6 – Shareholder Ratification of Excessive Termination Pay Shareholders request that the Board adopt a policy to seek shareholder approval of the top 10 senior managers’ new or renewed pay package that provides for termination payments with an estimated value exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the executive’s base salary plus target short-term bonus. The Board shall retain the option to seek shareholder approval at an annual meeting after material terms are agreed upon. Generous performance-based pay can sometimes be justified but shareholder ratification of “golden parachute” severance packages with a total cost exceeding 2.99 times base salary plus target short-term bonus better aligns management pay with shareholder interests. This proposal is relevant even if there are current golden parachute limits. A limit on golden parachutes is like a speed limit. A speed limit by itself does not guarantee that the speed limit will never be exceeded. Like this proposal the rules associated with a speed limit provide consequences if the limit is exceeded. With this proposal the consequences are a non-binding shareholder vote is required for unreasonably high golden parachutes. This proposal places no limit on long-term equity pay or any other type pay. This proposal thus has no impact on the ability to attract executive talent or discourage the use of long-term equity pay because it places no limit on golden parachutes. It simply requires that extra large golden parachutes be subject to a non binding shareholder vote at a shareholder meeting already scheduled for other matters. This proposal is relevant because the annual say on executive pay vote does not have a separate section for approving or rejecting golden parachutes. The topic of this proposal received between 51% and 65% support at: FedEx Spirt AeroSystems Alaska Air Fiserv Please vote yes: Shareholder Ratification of Excessive Termination Pay – Proposal 6 2024 Proxy Statement 117 Table of Contents Proposal 6 Statement of the Board of Directors in Opposition to Proposal 6 The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal, for the following reasons: • We already have an effective policy in place that requires us to seek stockholder approval for any future arrangement with any executive officer that provides for cash severance benefits exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the base salary plus target bonus. • We believe that the overly broad policy requested by the stockholder proposal would severely diminish our competitiveness as an employer and limit our ability to attract and retain highly qualified executive talent. • None of our primary competitors has a policy requiring stockholder approval of both cash and equity termination payments. • Our approach to executive termination arrangements is disciplined, responsible, and reasonable, making this proposal unnecessary. • Our current compensation practices align the incentives of senior leadership and stockholders. • Stockholders already have opportunities to provide feedback on executive compensation and post-termination compensation policies. • Stockholders have overwhelmingly endorsed our executive compensation practices. We already have an effective policy in place that requires us to seek stockholder approval for any future arrangement with any executive officer that provides for cash severance benefits exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the base salary plus target bonus. We believe that our tailored policy is the appropriate approach in aligning our executive compensation program with stockholder value creation, rather than the overly broad policy requested by the proposal, which would be impractical to implement and limit our ability to attract and retain qualified executive talent. Our current policy provides a balanced and reasonable limit on executive severance benefits, and our annual “Say-on-Pay” vote provides another mechanism for stockholders to provide feedback regarding our executive compensation program. We believe that the overly broad policy requested by the proposal would severely diminish Visa’s competitiveness as an employer and limit our ability to attract and retain highly qualified executive talent. Implementing the proposal would require certain aspects of employment offers to be contingent on stockholder approval. Such a requirement would put us at a competitive disadvantage in the labor market because the types of termination payments and benefits implicated by the proposal may be raised by candidates when negotiating employment offers for senior leadership positions. As a result, this proposal would interfere with our ability to make timely competitive offers of employment for highly qualified executive talent, which would negatively impact our efforts to enhance stockholder value and drive long-term strategic outcomes. None of our primary competitors have a policy requiring stockholder approval of cash, equity, and all other forms of termination payments. Moreover, the vast majority of companies in our compensation peer group have not adopted any type of policy requiring stockholder approval of all forms of termination payments. As a result, our top candidates may seek employment from a direct competitor or elsewhere once they learn that key aspects of their employment offer would require stockholder approval. These same issues would arise in developing employment packages to retain key employees. The resulting recruiting disadvantages and potential loss of talent in senior leadership could harm our stockholders. The uncertainty from seeking stockholder approval in such circumstances demonstrates the impracticality and negative impacts of this proposal. Our approach to executive termination arrangements is disciplined, responsible, and reasonable, making this proposal unnecessary. Our compensation program is designed to promote retention and reward performance that enhances stockholder value and drives long-term strategic outcomes. Accordingly, a significant portion of our executives’ compensation consists of equity awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, and performance shares. For example, to align senior leadership and stockholder incentives, our Executive Severance Plan and equity award agreements do not provide for any gross-ups and require a qualifying termination following a change in control before any change of control payments or benefits become available. There are no “single-trigger” payments upon a change of control. Equity awards granted since November 2021 provide pro-rated value for involuntary terminations without Cause to recognize our executives’ performance and contributions during the vesting period. In addition, the benefits available under the Executive Severance Plan are in line 118 Table of Contents Proposal 6 with the plans offered by our peers and primary competitors. Specifically, any such benefits are capped at two times base salary and target annual incentive, a pro-rated annual incentive for the year of termination, and a lump sum payment to provide continued health benefits for two years. Therefore, this proposal is unnecessary. Visa’s current compensation practices already align the incentives of senior leadership and stockholders. Our long-term equity incentive awards are a fundamental component of our compensation program and align senior leadership interests with stockholders’ interest by linking a substantial portion of compensation to the achievement of long-term corporate performance and operational efficiency. By requiring stockholder approval for executives to realize the full value of their equity awards upon a qualifying termination, the policy requested by this proposal effectively reduces the recruitment and retention value of long-term equity incentive awards in the executive compensation program. As a result, the proposal directly conflicts with one of the primary principles of our compensation program—namely, the alignment of senior leadership and stockholders’ interests. In addition, implementing the proposal would likely lead to elimination of change of control provisions, which risks potential misalignment between executives and stockholders during a potential change of control transaction with respect to executive retention and deal certainty. Furthermore, implementing this proposal would create additional risk of misalignment between Visa’s executives subject to our current policy and those subject to the policy requested by the proposal. Stockholders already have opportunities to provide feedback on executive compensation and post-termination compensation policies. Our annual Say-on-Pay vote provides opportunities for our stockholders to examine and provide their feedback on our executive compensation program. Our Board and management team greatly value the feedback of our stockholders, and we proactively engage with, and solicit feedback from, our stockholders regarding our executive compensation programs and philosophy. Our Board and management team routinely discuss our stockholders’ feedback on our executive compensation program. Furthermore, in calendar year 2023 we contacted our top 75 stockholders representing approximately 65% of the outstanding Class A common stock to discuss, among other things, executive compensation matters and held, or are scheduled to hold, videoconference meetings with 43 stockholders representing approximately 25% of our outstanding Class A common stock. A summary of all feedback is provided to our executive leadership and Board for discussion. This ongoing engagement with stockholders on our compensation program make the overly burdensome stockholder approval requirements set forth in the proposal unnecessary. Stockholders have overwhelmingly endorsed Visa’s executive compensation practices. We describe the details of our executive termination arrangements in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control sections of our proxy statement, and over the last five annual meetings of stockholders we have received an average of approximately 92% support for our advisory vote to approve executive compensation. These vote results demonstrate continued investor support for our executive compensation program design, including our termination arrangements. Similarly, in 2021 we received over 95% support for the amended and restated Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, which authorizes equity awards to be accelerated upon various types of termination. As a result, the Board believes that the policy requested by this stockholder proposal is not necessary and not in the best interest of our stockholders. FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE, THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE “AGAINST” THIS STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL. 2024 Proxy Statement 119 Table of Contents Voting and Meeting Information Voting and Meeting Information Information About Solicitation and Voting This proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board for use at the Annual Meeting to be held online via a live webcast at virtualshareholdermeeting.com/V2024 on Tuesday, January 23, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time, and any adjournment or postponement thereof. We will provide a re-playable webcast of the Annual Meeting, which will be available on the Events Calendar section of our Investor Relations website at investor.visa.com . Who Can Vote Visa’s Class A common stockholders of record at the close of business on November 24, 2023 will be entitled to vote on Proposals 1-3 and Proposals 5-6 at the Annual Meeting. Visa’s Class A, Class B, and Class C stockholders of record at the close of business on November 24, 2023 will each be entitled to vote on Proposal 4 at the Annual Meeting. On November 24, 2023, there were 1,582,524,186 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, 245,513,385 shares of Class B common stock outstanding (or 389,752,498 on an-as converted to Class A common stock basis), and 9,431,330 shares of Class C common stock outstanding (or 37,725,320 on an-as converted to Class A common stock basis). Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name All Class B and Class C holders are stockholders of record. If on November 24, 2023, your shares of Class A common stock were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, then you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As a stockholder of record, you may vote at the Annual Meeting or submit a proxy to have your shares voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with your instructions. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to submit your proxy by Internet or by telephone, or if you received paper proxy materials by mail, by filling out and returning the proxy card. For questions regarding your stock ownership, you may contact our transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, by telephone at (866) 456-9417 (within the U.S.) or (651) 306-4433 (international). Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Nominee If on November 24, 2023, your shares of Class A common stock were held in an account with a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, then you are the beneficial owner of the shares held in street name. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your nominee on how to vote the shares held in your account, and it has enclosed or provided voting instructions for you to use in directing it on how to vote your shares. However, the organization that holds your shares is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. Because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your Class A shares at the Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from the organization that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting. 120 Table of Contents Voting and Meeting Information How to Vote If you are a stockholder of record, including Class B and Class C stockholders, there are several ways for you to vote your shares or submit your proxy: By mail. If you received printed proxy materials, you may submit your proxy by completing, signing, and dating each proxy card received and returning it in the prepaid envelope. Sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card. Proxy cards submitted by mail must be received no later than January 22, 2024 to be voted at the Annual Meeting. Via the Internet. Instructions are shown on your Notice of Internet Availability. By telephone. Instructions are shown on your proxy card. At the Annual Meeting. You may vote your shares online during the Annual Meeting by following the instructions provided on the meeting website during the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the virtual Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also submit your proxy card or vote by telephone or via the Internet by the applicable deadline so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Class A common stock, you should receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or voting instructions from the broker or other nominee holding your shares. You should follow the instructions in the Notice or the voting instructions provided by your broker or nominee in order to instruct your broker or nominee on how to vote your shares. The availability of telephone and Internet voting will depend on the voting process of the broker or nominee. Shares held beneficially may be voted at the Annual Meeting only if you obtain a legal proxy from the broker or nominee giving you the right to vote the shares. If the Annual Meeting is adjourned or postponed, your proxy will still be effective and will be voted at the rescheduled or adjourned Annual Meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until the rescheduled or adjourned Annual Meeting. Change or Revoke a Proxy or Vote If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy before the completion of voting at the Annual Meeting by: • signing and returning a new proxy card with a later date; • submitting a later-dated proxy by telephone or via the Internet, since only your latest telephone or Internet proxy received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 22, 2024 will be counted; • attending the Annual Meeting online and voting again (your attendance at the Annual Meeting without further action will not revoke your proxy); or • delivering a written revocation to our Corporate Secretary at Visa Inc., P.O. Box 193243, San Francisco, CA 94119 before the Annual Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of Class A common stock, you must follow the instructions provided by the broker or other nominee holding your shares to change your voting instructions. How Proxies Are Voted If you are a Class A stockholder of record and you submit a signed proxy card, but you do not provide voting instructions on the card, your shares will be voted: • FOR the election of the eleven director nominees named in this proxy statement; • FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation paid to our named executive officers; • FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2024; 2024 Proxy Statement 121 Table of Contents Voting and Meeting Information • FOR the approval and adoption of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments; • FOR the approval of one or more adjournments of the annual meeting to a later date or time, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of Proposal 4 if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting to approve such proposal; and • AGAINST the stockholder proposal requesting that the Board adopt a policy to seek shareholder ratification of certain termination pay arrangements. If you are a beneficial owner of Class A common stock and you do not provide the broker or other nominee that holds your shares with voting instructions, the broker or nominee will determine if it has the discretionary authority to vote on your behalf. If you are a Class B or Class C stockholder and you submit a signed proxy card, but you do not provide voting instructions on the card, your shares will be voted FOR the approval and adoption of the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments as set forth in Proposal 4. Proposal 4 and Proposal 5 are expected to be “non-routine” proposals. If either Proposal 4 or Proposal 5 is determined to be “non-routine” by the NYSE or Broadridge Financial Solutions, as described below, any broker non-votes with respect to the applicable proposal will have the same effect as votes against. The determination of whether a proposal is “routine” or “non-routine” will be made by the NYSE or by Broadridge Financial Solutions, our independent agent to receive and tabulate stockholder votes, based on NYSE rules that regulate member brokerage firms. If a proposal is deemed “routine” and you do not give instructions to your broker or nominee, they may, but are not required to, vote your shares with respect to the proposal. If the proposal is deemed “non-routine” and you do not give instructions to your broker or nominee, they may not vote your shares with respect to the proposal and the shares will be treated as broker non-votes. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions to your broker or nominee, your broker or nominee may only vote your shares on routine matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. We encourage you to promptly provide voting instructions to your broker to ensure that your shares are voted on all of the proposals, even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting. Brokers or other nominees who hold shares of our Class A common stock for a beneficial owner have the discretion to vote on routine proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner at least ten days prior to the Annual Meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other nominee does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares. A quorum is required with respect to each item of business being submitted for stockholder vote at our Annual Meeting. A quorum exists for purposes of Proposals 1-3 and 5-6 when holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock entitled to vote are represented at the Annual Meeting either virtually or by proxy. A quorum exists for purposes of Proposal 4 when holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Class A common stock and holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of each of the Class B common stock and Class C common stock (on an as-converted to Class A common stock basis) entitled to vote are represented at the Annual Meeting either virtually or by proxy. If you have returned valid proxy instructions or attend the meeting virtually, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum, even if you abstain from voting on some or all matters introduced at the meeting. In addition, broker non-votes will be treated as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. 122 Table of Contents Voting and Meeting Information The vote required to approve each proposal is set forth below.

If the nominee does not receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her re-election, meaning that he or she does not have more votes cast FOR than AGAINST his or her re-election, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board that it accept the nominee’s contingent resignation, unless the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines that acceptance of the resignation would not be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. The Board will decide whether to accept or reject the contingent resignation at its next regularly scheduled meeting, but in no event later than 120 days following certification of the election results. The Board will publicly disclose its decision and rationale. Proxy Solicitor We will bear the expense of soliciting proxies. We have retained D.F. King & Co. to solicit proxies for a fee of $15,000 plus a reasonable amount to cover expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person, by telephone, or electronically by Visa personnel who will not receive additional compensation for such solicitation. Copies of proxy materials and the fiscal year 2023 Annual Report will be supplied to brokers and other nominees for the purpose of soliciting proxies from beneficial owners, and we will reimburse such brokers or other nominees for their reasonable expenses. We have also retained Innisfree to assist in soliciting proxies and in communicating with Visa stockholders in connection with the Class B Exchange Offer Program Certificate Amendments, and estimate that we will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $150,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. We have also agreed to indemnify Innisfree against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions). 2024 Proxy Statement 123 Table of Contents Voting and Meeting Information Voting Results Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. has been engaged as our independent agent to receive and tabulate stockholder votes.

Stockholders Sharing the Same Address The SEC has adopted rules that allow a company to deliver a single proxy statement or annual report to an address shared by two or more of its stockholders. This method of delivery, known as “householding,” permits us to realize significant cost savings, reduces the amount of duplicate information stockholders receive, and reduces the environmental impact of printing and mailing documents to our stockholders. Under this process, certain stockholders will receive only one copy of our proxy materials and any additional proxy materials that are delivered until such time as one or more of these stockholders notifies us that they want to receive separate copies. Any stockholders who object to or wish to begin householding may contact our Investor Relations Department at (650) 432-7644, InvestorRelations@visa.com, or Investor Relations, Visa Inc., P.O. Box 8999, San Francisco, CA 94128-8999. We will send an individual copy of the proxy statement to any stockholder who revokes their consent to householding within 30 days of our receipt of such revocation. 2024 Proxy Statement 125 Table of Contents Other Information Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report and SEC Filings Our financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
