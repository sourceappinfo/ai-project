Otis, Jr., our Independent Lead Director 2023 was a critical year for Verizon, as we took several important steps
to position ourselves for renewed growth and profitability, as well as continued leadership into the future. Most significantly, at the beginning of 2023 we appointed the leadership
team that will drive the next phase of Verizon’s growth. In the first quarter, we announced that four well-respected industry
veterans would assume these new roles in the company: • Tony Skiadas, Chief Financial Officer • Sowmyanarayan Sampath, CEO of Verizon Consumer • Kyle Malady, CEO of Verizon Business • Joe Russo, President of Global Networks and Technology That team hit the ground running, making significant changes to how we
operate. Both the Consumer and Global Network organizations were restructured to enable a more regional, targeted market approach. The
Consumer and Business teams also evolved their commercial models and employee incentives to increase their focus on providing the services
and products that customers need and want while maintaining the profitability of the company. The Finance team supported these efforts while simultaneously strengthening
our balance sheet to allow us financial flexibility in the future. At the same time, the Global Network team continued to lay the
foundation of our future mobility and broadband growth by expanding the coverage of our C-Band wireless spectrum throughout the country. This leadership team’s work has already yielded strong results.
In 2023: • We increased our wireless subscriber base by appproximately 1.5 million connections, expanding our wireless
    business that was already the largest in the country • We grew our fixed wireless access subscriber base to more than 3 million – representing a significant business that did
    not exist a few years ago • We grew our wireless service revenue, which reflects the recurring revenue from our wireless operations, by a healthy 3.2% These results are indicative of the momentum we have in the business
as we enter 2024. This year we expect to continue to see the benefits of our strategic decision to invest in C-Band spectrum. C-Band
gives us a competitive advantage in the areas where it is deployed and will be the basis for our wireless mobility and fixed wireless
access growth for years to come. While our strong
operational and financial results were important, equally important was that we achieved them in the right way. From logging
over 530,000 volunteer hours, to recycling or reusing nearly 47 million pounds of e-waste, to enabling our customers to avoid over 20
million metric tons of CO ₂ e,
our V Team employees supported our communities throughout the year at the same time they were providing excellent service to our customers. We look forward to building on our success in 2024.

    of the shareholder proposals. In accordance with SEC rules, we have included in this proxy statement proposals submitted by shareholders for consideration, if presented at the meeting. The proposals can be found beginning on page 64. vi Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Governance Item 1: Election of Directors Our approach to Board composition We believe that good governance starts with an independent, effective
and diverse Board. Our Board is one of Verizon’s most critical strategic assets. As such, the composition of the Board evolves along
with our strategic needs for the future. We believe we are more likely to achieve sustainable growth in shareholder value when our Board
has the right mix of skills, expertise and tenure, and can devote sufficient time to their duties as active and engaged members of our Board. The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee is strategic and purposeful
in its approach to refreshment and succession planning. The Committee considers the following key factors when nominating Directors: • Skills and experience. Verizon’s strategy is to extend
    our network leadership through continued innovation, grow our core business and provide our customers with best-in-class experiences,
    while maintaining the balanced capital allocation approach and financial discipline that our investors expect of us. In light of
    the Company’s strategy and expected future business needs, the Committee has identified the skills and experience listed below
    as important to be represented on the Board as a whole. • Consumer/B2B/retail • Cybersecurity • Financial expertise • Marketing and brand management • Regulatory/public policy • Risk management • Strategic planning • Technology • Telecommunications • Diversity. The Committee recognizes that a diverse set of viewpoints and practical experiences enhances
    the effectiveness of our Board in assessing the challenges and opportunities impacting our business and helping management achieve
    better outcomes. In evaluating Director candidates, the Committee considers how a candidate’s particular background, experience,
    qualifications, attributes and skills may complement, supplement or duplicate those of other prospective candidates. The Committee
    seeks a diverse group of candidates who possess the requisite judgment, background, skill, expertise and time, as well as diversity
    with respect to race, ethnicity and gender, to strengthen and increase the diversity, breadth of skills and qualifications of the
    Board. See Appendix A for the Board diversity disclosure required by Nasdaq Rule 5606. • Age and tenure. The Committee believes it is important to bring new perspectives and talents to the Board on a regular
    basis. Verizon does not have term limits for Directors because the Board recognizes that Directors who have served on the Board for
    an extended period can provide valuable insight into Verizon’s operations and future based on their experience with, and understanding
    of, Verizon’s history, policies and objectives. As an alternative to term limits, the Board seeks to maintain an average tenure
    of nine years or less for its independent Directors. In addition, to encourage new viewpoints on the Board, the Board seeks to add
    at least one new Director every two years on average. We have exceeded this goal by adding six new Directors since 2017, half of
    whom are women or diverse with respect to race or ethnicity. Under Verizon’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, a Director must
    retire from the Board the day before the annual meeting of shareholders that follows his or her 72nd birthday. • Board size. The Committee periodically evaluates whether to change the size of the Board based on the Board’s needs
    and the availability of qualified candidates. • Board dynamics. The Committee considers each Director candidate’s individual contribution or potential contribution
    to the Board as a whole and strives to maintain one hundred percent active and collaborative participation. 1 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Our Board’s independence Verizon’s Corporate Governance Guidelines establish standards
    for evaluating Director independence and require that a substantial majority of the Directors be independent. The Board determines
    the independence of each Director under New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq governance standards, as well as the more stringent
    standards included in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. These standards identify the types of relationships that, if material,
    could impair independence, and fix monetary thresholds at which the relationships are considered to be material. The Corporate Governance
    Guidelines are available on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.verizon.com/about/investors/corporate-governance . The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee conducts an annual review of any relevant
    business relationships that each Director may have with Verizon and reports its findings to the full Board. Based on the Committee’s recommendation, the Board has determined
    that all of the non-employee Director candidates meet the independence requirements of applicable law, the NYSE, Nasdaq and Verizon’s
    Corporate Governance Guidelines: Ms. Archambeau, Ms. Austin, Mr. Bertolini, Mr. Colao, Mr. Narasimhan, Mr. Otis,
    Mr. Schulman, Mr. Slater and Ms. Tomé. The Board also determined that Ms. Healey, who is not standing for re-election,
    and Mr. Weaver, who is not standing for re-election as a result of the retirement standard in our Guidelines, were independent. Additionally, the Board has determined that each member of the Audit
    Committee and the Human Resources Committee meets the additional, heightened independence criteria applicable to such committee members
    under the applicable NYSE and Nasdaq rules. The employers or former employers of Mr. Bertolini, Mr. Narasimhan,
    Mr. Schulman, and Ms. Tomé each made payments to Verizon for telecommunications services during 2023. In addition,
    during 2023 Verizon made payments to Mr. Bertolini’s former employer for fees relating to investment of pension plan assets,
    to Mr. Narasimhan’s employer for Starbucks gift cards purchased by Verizon customers, to Mr. Schulman’s former
    employer for processing fees relating to payments to and from our customers in connection with Verizon services and wireless devices,
    and to Ms. Tomé’s employer for shipping services. Applying the independence standards above, the Board considered
    the foregoing payments and determined that these general business transactions and relationships are not material and did not impair
    the ability of the Director to act independently. What ESG skills and experience do our Directors bring to the
    boardroom? ESG is incorporated into strategic and operational decision-making
    at Verizon. Each of our Directors has skills and experience in one or more aspects of ESG, including: •  business ethics and compliance •  cybersecurity and data privacy •  diversity, equity and inclusion •  environmental sustainability, including renewable energy •  governance •  network reliability and resilience •  regulatory and public policy trends •  responsible business and corporate social responsibility •  risk management •  talent attraction, retention and development Director nominations The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee considers and recommends
candidates for our Board. The Committee reviews all nominations submitted to Verizon, including individuals recommended by shareholders,
Directors or members of management. The Committee also retains executive search firms from time to time to help identify and evaluate
potential candidates. Any shareholder who wishes to recommend a Director candidate to the Committee
for its consideration should write to the Assistant Corporate Secretary at the address provided under “Contacting us.”
A recommendation for a Director candidate should include the candidate’s name, biographical data and a description of the candidate’s
qualifications in light of the requirements described below. If we make any material changes to the Committee’s procedure for considering
and nominating candidates, we will file a report with the SEC and post the information on the Corporate Governance section of our
website at www.verizon.com/about/investors/corporate-governance . 2 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information The Committee reviews the qualifications of each candidate for election
or re-election to the Board. For incumbent Directors, this review includes the Director’s participation in and contributions to
the activities of the Board, the Director’s independence and past meeting attendance, and whether the Director’s skills and
expertise continue to align with Verizon’s long-term business strategy. After the Committee evaluates all candidates for Director,
it presents its recommendation to the Board. The Committee also discusses with the Board any candidates who the Committee considered but
did not recommend for election or re-election. Before being nominated, each candidate for election and each incumbent
Director standing for re-election must consent to stand for election or re-election and provide certain representations required under
Verizon’s bylaws. Each candidate who is standing for election must also submit an irrevocable resignation, which will only become
effective if (i) our Board or any Committee determines that any of the required representations were untrue in any material respect,
or that the candidate breached any obligation under Verizon’s bylaws, or (ii) the candidate does not receive a majority of
the votes cast at the annual meeting of shareholders, and the independent members of our Board decide to accept the resignation. Any decision
about a resignation following an incumbent Director’s failure to obtain a majority of the votes cast will be disclosed within 90
days after the election results are certified. Director criteria, qualifications and experience To be eligible for consideration, any proposed Director candidate must: • Possess exemplary ethics and integrity • Have proven judgment and competence • Have professional skills and experience that align with the needs of Verizon’s long-term business strategy and complement
    the experience represented on the Board • Have demonstrated the ability to act independently and be willing to represent the long-term interests of all shareholders and
    not just those of a particular constituency or perspective • Be willing and able to devote sufficient time to fulfill responsibilities to Verizon and our shareholders Election process Verizon’s Directors are elected annually for a term of one year.
We believe annual elections are consistent with good corporate governance because they foster Director accountability and increase shareholder
confidence. Verizon’s bylaws require Directors to be elected by a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election. Nominees for election Our Board has nominated the 10 candidates below, all of whom currently
serve as Directors of Verizon, for election as Directors. Each candidate has consented to stand for election, and we do not anticipate
that any candidate will be unavailable to serve. If any candidate were to become unavailable before the election, the proxy committee
could vote the shares it represents for a substitute named by the Board. Each candidate has submitted an irrevocable, conditional letter
of resignation that our Board will consider if that candidate fails to receive a majority of the votes cast. Biographical information for each Director nominee follows, including
career highlights, the key skills and experience that we believe each Director nominee brings to our Board, and other public board directorships.
All of our nominees bring more qualifications to the Board than those highlighted in their biographies, and these are reflected in the
aggregate Board composition statistics provided in the Proxy Summary. When deciding to re-nominate these Directors, the Corporate Governance
and Policy Committee and the Board considered each Director’s individual qualifications, as well as the aggregate of skills and
experience represented on the Board, in light of the Company’s strategy and expected future business needs. The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the
    election of the following Director candidates. 3 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Shellye Archambeau Independent Director since: 2013 Age: 61 Committees: Audit Corporate Governance and Policy (Chair) Key skills and experience: • Leadership: Highly regarded and accomplished executive with over 30 years of experience building and

framework The membership, structure, policies and practices of our
        Board and its committees promote the effective exercise of the Board’s role in the governance of Verizon. In addition,
        our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide a framework for the Board’s operations and address key governance practices.
        The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee monitors best practices and developments in corporate governance, considers
        the views of Verizon’s shareholders, and periodically recommends changes to the Board’s policies and practices,
        including the Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our Directors provide input on the operation of the Board annually, as
        part of the Board assessment process, and as warranted throughout the year. Board leadership structure Verizon’s governance framework provides the Board with
        the flexibility to select the appropriate Board leadership structure for the Company. In making this leadership structure
        determination, the Board considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business and the long-term interests
        of our shareholders. Given the dynamic and highly competitive environment in which
        Verizon operates, the Board believes that Verizon and our shareholders are best served by a Chairman who has broad and
        deep knowledge of our industry, providing valuable knowledge to the Board and increasing the information available to
        the Board, and who has the vision, energy and experience to position Verizon as the leader of transformational change
        in the communications ecosystem. Based on these considerations, the Board has determined that, at this time, our CEO,
        Hans Vestberg, is the Director best qualified to serve in the role of Chairman. As CEO, Mr. Vestberg also has a greater
        understanding of the strategies and tactics of the Company and can most readily identify potential opportunities and challenges. To maintain an appropriate level of independent oversight,
        checks and balances in its governance, and consistent with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the independent members
        of the Board have elected an independent Lead Director who has the responsibilities described under “Role of the
        Lead Director.” Clarence Otis, Jr. currently serves as Lead Director. Mr. Otis acquired significant expertise
        in financial risk assessment and enterprise risk management as a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Board,
        multiple public company boards and audit committees, and as CEO of Darden Restaurants, and is well qualified to lead the
        Board in fulfilling its oversight role. The Lead Director and our Chairman and CEO meet and speak
        with each other regularly about the Company’s strategy and operations and the functioning of the Board. The Lead
        Director provides a tangible independent source of authority and serves as an impartial resource for the Board to express
        its views regarding management. In addition, the Lead Director represents the Board in communications with shareholders
        and other stakeholders regularly, and any shareholder or interested party may communicate directly with the Lead Director. All Directors play an active role in overseeing Verizon’s
        business at both the Board and committee level. Every Director receives the agenda for each Board meeting in advance and
        can request changes. In addition, all Directors have unrestricted access to the Chairman and the senior leadership team
        at all times. The Board believes that shareholders are best served by this
        current leadership structure because it features an independent Lead Director who provides independent and objective oversight,
        and who can express the Board’s positions in a forthright manner. Clarence
                                         Otis, Jr. Lead Director Role of the Lead Director •   Promotes a strong Board
        culture, including encouraging and facilitating active participation of all Directors •   Approves the agenda,
        schedule and materials for all Board meetings, in consultation with the Chairman •   Is available to advise
        the committee chairs in fulfilling their designated responsibilities •   Acts as principal liaison
        with the Chairman •   Chairs executive sessions,
        including those held to evaluate the CEO’s performance and compensation •   Chairs any meeting of
        the Board if the Chairman is not present •   Calls Board meetings
        and executive sessions as needed •   Leads the Board’s
        annual self-evaluation •   Oversees the process
        for CEO succession planning along with the Human Resources Committee •   Acts as a primary point of
        contact for Board communication with major shareholders and other key stakeholders, as appropriate 9 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information This structure also strengthens our independent Directors’
        ability to be fully involved in the Board’s operations and decision-making, and to fulfill their risk management
        and oversight responsibilities. Board meetings and executive sessions In 2023, our Board of Directors held 11 meetings, including
        six regularly scheduled meetings and five special meetings. No incumbent Director attended fewer than 75% of the total
        number of meetings of our Board and the committees to which the Director was assigned in 2023. Directors standing for
        re-election are expected to attend the annual meeting of shareholders. In 2023, all but one Director attended the annual
        meeting. The Corporate Governance Guidelines require the independent
        Directors to meet in executive session without any members of management present at least twice a year to review and evaluate
        the performance of the Board and to evaluate the performance and approve the compensation of the CEO. In practice, the
        independent members of our Board typically meet in executive session during each regularly scheduled Board meeting. Service on other boards and time commitments Based on the increasing demands placed upon directors of
        public companies and the need to devote sufficient time to fulfill their responsibilities effectively, the Board has a
        policy that a Director who is an executive officer of a public company should serve on no more than two public company
        boards, and other Directors should serve on no more than four public company boards.  In addition, members of the
        Audit Committee should serve on no more than two other public company audit committees. All of our Directors are in compliance
        with these policies, which can be found in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. When the Corporate Governance and Policy Committee identifies
        and evaluates Director candidates, it considers their qualifications along with their other time commitments to determine
        whether the candidate can devote the necessary time for effective service on the Board. Each year when considering incumbent
        Directors for re-nomination, the Committee considers the extent to which each incumbent Director is prepared for and actively
        participates in Board and Committee meetings, to ensure that each incumbent Director who is re-nominated is devoting sufficient
        time to fulfill his or her responsibilities to the Company and its shareholders. Board committees Our Board of Directors has established four standing committees:
        the Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance and Policy Committee, the Finance Committee and the Human Resources Committee.
        Each committee has a written charter that defines its specific responsibilities. The chair of each committee approves
        the agenda and materials for each meeting. Each committee has the authority to retain independent advisors to assist it
        in carrying out its responsibilities. Our committee meetings are not held concurrently, which enables
        our Directors to sit on multiple committees. Our newly appointed Directors also attend all committee meetings for a period
        prior to being appointed to any particular committee, which gives them a broad-based introduction to the Company and allows
        them to understand the inner workings of all committees. Beyond
                                         the boardroom Engagement outside of Board meetings
        provides our Directors with additional insight into our business and our industry. It also gives them valuable perspectives
        on the performance of our Company, the Board, our CEO and other members of senior management, as well as on the Company’s
        strategic direction. •   Our independent
        Directors have discussions with each other and with our CEO, and have informal individual and small group meetings with
        high potential members of our senior management team in order to gain insight into the Company’s management development
        program and succession pipeline. •   Our committee
        chairs and Lead Director meet and speak regularly with each other and with members of our management in connection with
        planning for meetings. All Directors are encouraged to provide suggestions for meeting agendas and materials. •   Our Directors
        periodically attend “deep dives” on current topics of interest and technology training as part of their ongoing
        Director education program. •   Our Directors
        receive weekly updates on recent developments, press coverage and current events that relate to our business, as well
        as monthly business operation reviews and analyst reports. 10 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Audit Committee Key responsibilities and activities •   Assess and discuss with management

effectiveness of the Board and its committees and to continue to reflect evolving best practices in their processes. The Lead Director
generally leads the assessment process, but the Board periodically engages a third-party consulting firm to bring an outside perspective
to the process. As part of the annual assessment, each Director completes a detailed written questionnaire designed to elicit suggestions
for improving the effectiveness of the Board and its committees, and to obtain feedback on a range of issues, including Board leadership,
culture, corporate purpose and strategy, composition and structure, and risk management. Following the Directors’ submissions
of their completed questionnaires, the Lead Director or the third-party consulting firm conducts individual interviews with each
of the independent Directors to discuss these topics, among others. The Lead Director then facilitates an evaluation session with
the full Board to discuss the feedback received from the questionnaires and from the Director interviews. The evaluation for 2023
was conducted by a third-party consulting firm and concluded that the Board and its committees are operating effectively. Recommendations
in recent years to further enhance Board effectiveness, which we addressed, have included continued focus on Board refreshment,
strategic and operational oversight, and the development of Verizon’s next generation of leaders. In addition to annual assessments, the Board evaluates and modifies
its oversight of Verizon’s operations on an ongoing basis. During their executive sessions, the independent Directors consider
agenda topics that they believe deserve additional focus and raise new topics to be addressed in future meetings. The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee annually appraises the
framework for our Board and committee assessment processes. Board and committee

programs to promote a deep understanding of issues affecting our business and industry, help Directors stay current and knowledgeable
about the Company’s business and its competitive and technology landscape, and support Directors in performing their oversight
duties. New Director orientation. When a new Director joins the
Board, we conduct an orientation program that includes, among other things, a review of the Company’s purpose, business strategy
and operations, technology, financial condition, legal and regulatory framework, and other relevant topics. Director continuing education. We support current Directors
in their ongoing learning by providing continuing education opportunities and programs. These programs may include presentations
by thought leaders and industry experts, formal education sessions, meetings with management subject matter experts, participation
in industry forums and site visits. Oversight of strategy All of our Directors have deep experience and expertise in strategic
planning and execution. The Board engages Verizon’s senior leaders in robust discussions about strategic goals and challenges
them to execute on the strategic plan, address emerging challenges and disruptions, and promote innovation. In addition to an annual
strategy retreat, the agenda for each regularly scheduled Board meeting allocates substantial time for a strategy review. During
these reviews, the Board engages with senior management regarding the competitive landscape, operational objectives and challenges
and regulatory developments. 13 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Oversight of business risks While senior management has primary responsibility for managing
business risks, our Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight. The Board works closely with senior management to develop
a comprehensive view of Verizon’s key short- and long-term business risks. Verizon has a formalized business risk management
reporting process that is designed to provide visibility to the Board about critical risks and risk mitigation strategies. The Board of Directors uses several different levels of review
in overseeing the management of risks inherent in the operation of Verizon’s businesses and the implementation of our strategic
plan. The Board addresses the primary risks associated with Verizon’s business units and corporate functions in its operations
reviews of those units and functions. Further, the Board reviews the risks associated with Verizon’s strategic plan throughout
the year. In addition, each of our Board committees oversees the management
of risks that fall within that committee’s areas of responsibility. In performing this function, each Board committee has
full access to management and may engage independent advisors. As part of the Board’s risk oversight function, the Board
regularly brings in outside advisors and experts to speak to the Board on topics including emerging business risks. In 2023, these
topics included geopolitical, technological and economic risks, opportunities and trends. Enterprise risk management. The Audit Committee
oversees the operations of Verizon’s Enterprise Risk Management program, which identifies the primary risks to Verizon’s
business and also assesses Verizon’s overall control environment, including controls related to financial reporting, disclosure,
compliance and significant financial and business risks. These risks inform Board and Audit Committee discussion topics throughout
the year. Senior management teams from across the business meet with
the Audit Committee, on at least a semi-annual basis, to discuss the primary risks associated with their respective business units
and functions, and related risk mitigation initiatives. As part of Verizon’s annual enterprise risk assessment process,
the Audit Committee also reviews key business risks with the CFO, the Senior Vice President of Internal Audit and the Chief Compliance
Officer. • The CFO updates the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis on the activities
    of the Verizon Management Audit Committee, which has management oversight responsibility for the implementation of the Enterprise
    Risk Management program. • Verizon’s Senior Vice President of Internal Audit, who functionally
    reports directly to the Audit Committee, facilitates the Committee’s oversight of the Company’s implementation
    of risk management controls and methodologies to address identified risks, including financial, operational, regulatory and
    compliance risks. • Verizon’s Chief Compliance Officer, who also functionally reports
    directly to the Audit Committee, oversees periodic risk assessments of specific compliance risk areas, such as anti-corruption,
    and reports the findings to the Committee. The Audit Committee routinely meets privately with representatives
from the independent registered public accounting firm, the Senior Vice President of Internal Audit, and the Chief Legal Officer. Strategic crisis management. The Company maintains
a Strategic Crisis Management Program in order to position our leadership team and the Board to respond to strategic risks and
protect Verizon’s core assets in a potential crisis. The Program defines clear roles and responsibilities in dealing with
various potential crises and outlines a process to make decisions and implement appropriate actions on a timely basis. Through
the Program, the Verizon Strategic Crisis Leadership Team is positioned to assume executive ownership of strategic crisis events
through drills and scenario-based training. The Program also includes employee crisis awareness training, which encourages employees
across the Company to quickly identify and report circumstances or events that could develop into a strategic crisis, so that
our leadership team can take appropriate steps in response. In addition, our Board of Directors maintains a Board Crisis Response
Plan, which is structured to be used in connection with any crisis that could have a significant strategic impact on the Company’s
brand, reputation, or finances, or legal, political or regulatory position. The Plan provides a framework for appropriate Board
oversight and assessment of the response to a crisis that allows the necessary flexibility to address the different types of crises
that might arise. Financial risk and capital allocation. The Finance
Committee assists our Board in its oversight of financial risk management. In performing this function, the Finance Committee
monitors Verizon’s capital needs and financing plans and oversees the strategy for managing risks related to currency, interest
rate, renewable energy and counterparty exposures. The Finance Committee reviews and approves the Company’s derivatives
policy and monitors the use of derivatives. The Finance Committee also reviews Verizon’s pension and other postretirement
benefit obligations, as well as its insurance and self-insurance programs. 14 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Oversight of ESG strategy and risks Our Board recognizes that operating responsibly and appropriately
managing the environmental and social risks arising from our operations are fundamental to the long-term success of our Company.
The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee oversees corporate responsibility, public policy and sustainability. Verizon has
a centralized ESG team that is dedicated to enhancing the Company’s sustainability reporting and stakeholder engagement
on ESG issues that align with Verizon’s core business strategy. This cross-functional team focuses on strategic areas including
governance, reporting, human rights and environmental sustainability and also oversees Verizon’s efforts to deliver on our
ESG commitments. The Senior Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary regularly provides the Corporate Governance
and Policy Committee with updates on the Company’s ESG priorities, commitments, stakeholder engagement and reporting. In
addition, the ESG, Enterprise Risk Management and Accounting Policy teams together comprise our ESG Center of Excellence, which
is implementing an expanded internal control framework for ESG information to facilitate our compliance with climate-related laws
and regulations. Environmental sustainability and climate. To address
climate-related risks, Verizon has a long-term goal to achieve net-zero emissions in our operations by 2035. We have set interim
Science-based Target Initiative-approved targets to reduce operational and value chain emissions, as well as renewable energy
targets. We are upgrading and hardening our infrastructure to be prepared for a changing climate, improving energy efficiency
across our networks and facilities, making substantial investments in renewable energy, and developing solutions to help our customers
to reduce their carbon footprints. Several of our Directors have experience with climate-related issues, including renewable energy,
network resilience, innovative technological solutions and emissions management. Each committee of the Board oversees the management of the
specific risks related to our environmental sustainability strategy and the transition to a low-carbon economy that fall under
the committee’s area of responsibility: • Audit Committee. Environmental and climate-related risks discussed during annual business risk reviews with the
    Audit Committee include operational and financial risks relating to energy management and our renewable energy and carbon
    neutral commitments, maintaining network reliability during catastrophic and weather-related events, and the impacts of pending
    or possible laws or regulations that seek to mitigate climate change. • Corporate Governance and Policy Committee. The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee oversees Verizon’s
    strategy for managing climate-related risks and monitors the Company’s progress on meeting climate-related goals. The
    Senior Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary regularly updates the Committee on the activities of
    Verizon’s Executive Climate Oversight Committee, a cross-functional management committee that has management oversight
    responsibility for Verizon’s climate-related strategy and initiatives. • Finance Committee. The Finance Committee oversees the strategy for managing risks related to Verizon’s renewable
    energy exposure through renewable energy purchase agreements, as well as the Company’s green financing program. • Human Resources Committee. To incentivize management to achieve the Company’s climate-related goals, the
    Human Resources Committee has included a carbon intensity reduction metric as one of the performance measures in the Short-Term
    Plan since 2014. Data privacy and cybersecurity. Protecting the
privacy of our customers’ information and the security of our systems and networks has long been and will continue to be
a priority at Verizon. The Board is committed to maintaining strong and meaningful privacy and security protections for our customers’
information. The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing Verizon’s risk management programs relating to
data protection and privacy and cybersecurity. The Audit Committee also monitors Verizon’s compliance in the areas of data
protection and privacy. • Data privacy. Verizon has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help
    protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of customer information and data we collect and store. Verizon has
    a dedicated Chief Privacy Officer whose team advises the business on privacy risks and assesses the effectiveness of privacy
    controls. The Chief Privacy Officer at least annually briefs the Audit Committee on data privacy risks and mitigating actions. • Cybersecurity. To more effectively address the cybersecurity threats posed today, Verizon has a dedicated Chief
    Information Security Officer (CISO) whose team is responsible for leading enterprise-wide information security strategy, policy,
    standards, architecture and processes. Verizon’s comprehensive information security program includes, among other aspects,
    cyber defense including incident response and resiliency planning and testing, product and platform security, cyber architecture
    and engineering, identity and access management, and risk assessment and management including third-party oversight. The CISO
    leads an annual review and discussion with the full Board dedicated to Verizon’s cybersecurity risks, threats and protections.
    The CISO provides a mid-year update to this annual review to the Audit Committee and, as warranted, additional updates throughout
    the year. The Audit Committee also receives a report from senior management on Verizon’s cybersecurity posture and related
    matters at each of its other meetings during the year at which the CISO is not present. 15 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Responsible business. Verizon’s Responsible
Business Council, chaired by the CEO and composed of members of the senior leadership team, oversees the integration of responsible
practices as a core operating principle. At least annually, the Chief Corporate Social Responsibility Officer reports to the Board
on the Council’s activities and Verizon’s community and social impact initiatives. Current policy and technology issues impacting corporate
reputation. Companies in our industry and beyond are facing challenges that have impacted their reputations and brought
adverse attention and action by consumers, regulators and shareholders. The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee has primary
responsibility for overseeing the Company’s handling of risks related to Verizon’s position and engagement on important
public policy and technology issues, as well as individual events and incidents that may affect the Company’s business and
reputation. At least annually, Verizon’s Chief Legal Officer updates the Committee on the current policy and technology
issues facing the Company that may generate publicity and impact corporate reputation. Periodically throughout the year, the Committee
reviews and discusses with management the most pressing known reputational issues and the Company’s position on each issue,
as well as the processes in place to anticipate potential developments in each of the identified areas and to quickly respond
to any such developments in a timely manner. Outside the regular meeting cycle, management informs the Board of current developments
that could pose reputational risks to the industry or the Company. Political activities and lobbying. Verizon adheres
to the highest ethical standards when engaging in any political activity. The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee oversees
our political activity, including lobbying, and receives a comprehensive briefing from the Senior Vice President of Public Policy
and Government Affairs on these activities at least annually. Moreover, Verizon’s political activity is subject to robust
internal controls. The Code of Conduct requires that all lobbying activities on behalf of Verizon be authorized by public policy
or legal personnel. Corporate policy and training materials provide guidance to employees regarding legal requirements in connection
with lobbying activities. Verizon understands that transparency regarding our political
activity is critical to maintaining the trust of our stakeholders. We publish a Political Engagement Report on our corporate website
that is updated twice a year. This report describes our current policy priorities, provides information about lobbying activities
and our Public Policy organization’s significant memberships in trade associations and issue advocacy organizations, and
lists all of our PAC contributions, corporate political contributions, support for ballot initiatives and independent expenditures
for the period covered. Verizon supports trade associations and issue advocacy organizations for a number of reasons, including
to reflect our interest in the community, acquire valuable industry and market expertise and support our strategic policy positions,
business goals and interests. We recognize that we may not always agree with every position of each organization or its members
and that these groups often have a diversity of members, interests and viewpoints that may not always reflect Verizon’s
beliefs or priorities. In order to mitigate reputational risks associated with our engagement with these organizations, we regularly
review our participation to confirm ongoing alignment with our corporate priorities and goals. When we disagree with a position
of an organization we support, we communicate our concerns through the senior executives who interact with these organizations. Human rights. As expressed in our Human Rights
Statement, Verizon is committed to operating with respect for internationally recognized human rights. We have a dedicated Business
and Human Rights Program that works to embed human rights considerations into responsible business decision-making processes across
the Company. The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee oversees our human rights work. Anti-corruption. Verizon has a robust anti-corruption
program to comply with applicable anti-corruption rules, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.
As part of this program, the Audit Committee receives annual reports summarizing the Company’s continued compliance with
applicable anti-corruption rules on a Company-wide basis and within the various business units and corporate functions. Every
two years, we review and assess our anti-corruption program with the goal of finding areas for improvement. This process is done
under the direction of our Chief Compliance Officer, who reports the findings to the Audit Committee. Oversight of human capital management The Human Resources Committee is charged with oversight of
our strategies, initiatives and programs related to human capital management, including with respect to employee diversity, equity
and inclusion, talent acquisition, retention and development, employee engagement, pay equity and corporate culture. Culture and employee engagement. Our Board views
our employees as one of Verizon’s most critical assets and regularly receives briefings from the CEO and the Chief Human
Resources Officer on initiatives to strengthen our company culture and encourage employee engagement. The CEO and the Chief Human
Resources Officer review with the Board the results of the “Pulse” surveys completed by employees across the Company.
Periodically, our Directors attend employee town halls and participate in leadership forums with employees. 16 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Diversity, equity and inclusion. Verizon is committed
to creating a collaborative, inclusive, equitable and diverse environment – within Verizon, with our customers, and
among our business partners and suppliers. The Board views this commitment as a business imperative and a competitive advantage.
To promote diversity in our workforce and encourage the contribution of diverse business partners to our success, the Human Resources
Committee has included diversity targets as performance measures in the Short-Term Plan for over 20 years. The Chief Human Resources
Officer reviews diversity representation and initiatives with the Committee at least annually. Additionally, the Corporate Governance
and Policy Committee regularly reviews and discusses Board diversity matters. The Finance Committee also receives regular updates
from our Senior Vice President and Treasurer about the Company’s efforts to foster diversity, equity and inclusion in the
capital markets through our financing activities. Succession planning and talent development. Our
Board recognizes that one of its most important duties is to promote continuity in Verizon’s senior leadership by overseeing
the development of executive talent and planning for the efficient succession of the CEO. Our Board has delegated primary oversight
responsibility for succession planning to the Human Resources Committee, which oversees assignments to key leadership positions.
The Human Resources Committee reports on its activities to the full Board, which addresses succession planning during executive
sessions that typically occur in connection with each regularly scheduled meeting. To align the succession planning and management development
process with Verizon’s strategic objectives, the Board and the Human Resources Committee regularly consult with the CEO
on Verizon’s organizational needs and competitive challenges, the potential of key managers, and plans for future developments
and emergency situations. As part of this process, the Board and the Human Resources Committee also seek input from the Chief
Human Resources Officer, as well as advice on related compensation issues from the Human Resources Committee’s independent
compensation consultant. Our Board generally conducts an in-depth review of senior
leader development and succession planning at least twice a year. Led by the CEO and the Chief Human Resources Officer, this review
addresses Verizon’s management development initiatives, assesses senior management resources, and identifies individuals
for consideration as potential future senior executives. Our goal is to develop well-rounded, experienced and diverse
senior leaders. High-potential executives are challenged regularly with additional responsibilities, new positions or promotions
to expose them to our various operations. These individuals are often positioned to interact more frequently with the Board, both
in full Board meetings and in less formal settings and small groups, so the Directors can get to know and assess them. Employee health and safety. Verizon is committed
to maintaining a safe workplace and environmentally responsible work practices, and we expect our suppliers to share that commitment.
At least annually, the Board receives a briefing on health and safety matters, including incidents involving employees and suppliers
and actions that management is taking to limit these risks. Compensation risk . The Human Resources Committee considers
the impact of our executive compensation program and the incentives created by compensation awards on Verizon’s overall
risk profile. It also oversees management’s annual assessment of compensation risk arising from Verizon’s compensation
policies and practices. This annual assessment is conducted by members of management including the Senior Vice President of Internal
Audit and the Senior Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. The assessment includes a review of the features
and characteristics of Verizon’s compensation policies and programs, the performance metrics under the Short- and Long-Term
Incentive Plans and the process for calculating and approving adjustments that are part of the plan, as well as the approval processes
for compensation programs and related payouts. The assessment also reviews governance oversight at the Committee and Board level,
Code of Conduct provisions and mandatory training programs that reinforce policies that mitigate risk, and performance metrics
and measurement periods that are aligned with Verizon’s business strategy. Based on management’s review, Verizon has concluded
that our compensation policies and procedures are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Verizon because they
are appropriately structured and discourage employees from taking excessive risks. Other risk-related matters Business conduct and ethics. We are committed
to operating with the highest level of integrity, responsibility and accountability. To that end, we have adopted a Code of Conduct
that applies to all employees, including the CEO, the CFO and the Controller. The Code of Conduct describes each employee’s
responsibility to conduct business with the highest ethical standards and provides guidance about preventing, reporting and remediating
potential compliance violations in key areas. Verizon thoroughly investigates all claims of misconduct. Various types of
cases are reported to the Chief Compliance Officer, who discusses the most serious Code of Conduct violations with the Audit
Committee at least annually. 17 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Directors are expected to act in the spirit of the Code of
Conduct, and to comply with the specific ethical provisions of the Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our Board is strongly predisposed
not to waive any of these business conduct and ethics provisions for senior executives or Directors. In the event of an amendment
or a waiver, we will promptly disclose the Board’s action on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.verizon.com/about/investors/corporate-governance . Related person transactions. The Board has adopted
the Related Person Transaction Policy that is included in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Corporate Governance and Policy
Committee reviews transactions between Verizon and any of our Directors or executive officers or members of their immediate families
to determine if any participants have a material interest in the transaction. If the Committee determines that a material interest
exists, based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the Committee may approve, disapprove, ratify or cancel the transaction
or recommend another course of action. Any Committee members who are involved in a transaction under review do not participate
in the Committee’s deliberations. During 2023, there were no related person transactions required to be disclosed in this
proxy statement. Our approach to shareholder engagement We believe that a robust shareholder outreach and engagement
program is an essential component of maintaining our strong corporate governance practices. Ongoing communication with our investors
helps our Board and senior management gather useful feedback on a wide range of topics. In our discussions with investors, we
seek their input on a variety of corporate governance, compensation and ESG topics that may impact our business or reputation.
We strive for a collaborative approach with investors to solicit and understand a variety of perspectives. These engagements include
the participation of our independent Lead Director, Clarence Otis, Jr., or other Directors, when requested and appropriate. Shareholder
feedback is regularly summarized and shared with our Board. In 2023, topics covered in engagement included: Environmental • Climate

engagement and decision-useful reporting in strategic areas including governance, human rights, environmental sustainability,
and digital trust and safety. Our ESG team also oversees Verizon’s efforts to deliver on our ESG commitments. Our ESG
reporting is aligned with the SASB Standard for the telecommunications industry, the recommendations of the Task Force on
Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Global Reporting Initiative and United Nations Global Compact. We strive to
make it easy for shareholders to learn about our positions and progress on the issues that matter to them. To that end, we
have created an ESG Resources Hub on our Investor Relations website at www.verizon.com/about/investors/reporting that houses all of our ESG reporting and policies. 18 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Where to find more information You can find information about

with our Board, any committee of our Board, any individual Director (including the Lead Director and the committee chairs), or
the non-employee Directors as a group, by writing to: Verizon Communications Inc. Board of Directors (or committee name, individual Director, Lead Director, committee chair or non-employee Directors as a group, as appropriate) 1095 Avenue of the Americas New York, New York 10036 Verizon’s Corporate Secretary reviews all correspondence
addressed to our Directors and periodically provides the Board with copies of all communications concerning the functions of our
Board or its committees, or that otherwise require Board attention. Typically, the Corporate Secretary will not forward communications
that are of a personal nature or are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of our Board, including business solicitations
or advertisements, mass mailings, job-related inquiries, or other unsuitable communications. All communications involving substantive
accounting or auditing matters are forwarded to the Chair of the Audit Committee. 19 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Non-employee Director compensation The Human Resources Committee, in consultation with its independent
compensation consultant, reviews and recommends non-employee Director compensation. In 2023, each non-employee Director of Verizon
received a grant of Verizon share equivalents valued at $210,000 on the grant date and an annual cash payment of $125,000. The
Chairs of the Corporate Governance and Policy Committee and the Finance Committee each received an additional annual cash payment
of $20,000, and the Chairs of the Audit Committee and the Human Resources Committee each received an additional annual cash payment
of $30,000. The Lead Director received an additional annual cash payment of $75,000. No additional fees were paid for meeting
attendance. All share equivalents that non-employee Directors receive
are automatically credited to the Director’s deferred compensation account under the Verizon Executive Deferral Plan, which
is referred to as the Deferral Plan, and invested in a hypothetical Verizon stock fund. Amounts in a Director’s deferred
compensation account are paid in a cash lump sum in the year following the year the Director leaves our Board. Non-employee Directors may choose to defer all or part of
their annual cash payments under the Deferral Plan. They may elect to invest these amounts in the hypothetical investment options
available to participants in Verizon’s Management Savings Plan or in a hypothetical cash account that earns a return rate
equal to the long-term, high-grade corporate bond yield average as published by Moody’s Investor Services. The non-employee Directors are eligible to participate in
the Verizon Foundation Matching Gifts Program. Under this program, which is open to all Verizon employees, the Foundation matches
up to $5,000 per year of charitable contributions to accredited colleges and universities, $1,000 per year of charitable contributions
to any non-profit with 501(c)(3) status, and $1,000 per year of charitable donations to designated disaster relief campaigns. 20 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Non-employee Director compensation in 2023 Name (a) Fees earned or paid in cash 1 ($) (b) Stock awards 2 ($) (c) Option awards ($) (d) Non-equity incentive plan compensation ($) (e) Change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings ($) (f) All other compensation ($) (g) Total ($) (h) Shellye Archambeau* 145,000 210,000 0 0 0 0 355,000 Roxanne Austin 125,000 210,000 0 0 0 0 335,000 Mark Bertolini* 145,000 210,000 0 0 0 0 355,000 Vittorio Colao 125,000 210,000 0 0 0 0 335,000 Melanie Healey 125,000 210,000 0 0 0 0 335,000 Laxman Narasimhan 125,000 210,000 0 0 0 0 335,000 Clarence Otis, Jr.** 200,000 210,000 0 0 0 0 410,000 Daniel Schulman* 155,000 210,000 0 0 0 0 365,000 Rodney Slater 125,000 210,000 0 0 0 0 335,000 Carol Tomé 125,000 210,000 0 0 0 0 335,000 Gregory Weaver* 155,000 210,000 0 0 0 0 365,000 * Denotes a chair of a standing committee during 2023. ** Mr. Otis served as Lead Director during 2023. 1 This column includes all fees earned in 2023, whether the fee was paid in 2023 or deferred. 2 For each non-employee Director, this column reflects the grant date fair value of the non-employee Director’s 2023

compensation program since our first annual advisory vote on the matter in 2009. We are asking you to vote in favor of the following
non-binding resolution: “Resolved, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory
basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in Verizon’s proxy statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting
of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis, the Compensation Tables, and the related narrative discussion.” The structure of our executive compensation program for 2023 is
similar to prior years, with updates to address changes in our strategic emphasis. Our Board recommends a vote FOR this resolution
because the Board believes our program effectively: • Encourages strong short-term and long-term performance; • Aligns the executives’ long-term interests with those of our shareholders;
and • Retains high-performing executives. In the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Compensation Tables
beginning on page 23, we provide a detailed description of our executive compensation
program, including our philosophy, the elements of our program, and the compensation of our named executive officers. We encourage
you to read these sections before deciding how to vote on this proposal. This advisory resolution, commonly known as a “say-on-pay”
resolution, is not binding on our Board of Directors. Nevertheless, the Board and the Human Resources Committee value shareholder
feedback received through this annual say-on-pay vote and our direct investor outreach program. The voting results and direct shareholder
input are carefully reviewed and considered and are an important part of the process for evaluating our executive compensation
program. The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR this proposal. 22 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Compensation discussion and analysis 2023 Named executive officers Hans Vestberg Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Anthony Skiadas* Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Sowmyanarayan Sampath** Executive Vice President and Group CEO – Verizon Consumer Kyle Malady** Executive Vice President and Group CEO – Verizon Business Craig Silliman Executive Vice President and President – Verizon Global

of the Board of Directors oversees the design and implementation of the compensation program for our named executive officers,
as well as Verizon’s management succession planning, talent development and human capital management initiatives, including
with respect to employee diversity, equity and inclusion and pay equity. The CEO’s compensation is determined by the independent
members of the Board after receiving the Committee’s recommendation. References to the Committee in this Compensation Discussion
and Analysis with respect to the CEO’s compensation reflect that process. Management. The Committee consults with the Chief
Human Resources Officer about the design, administration and operation of the compensation program. The Committee has delegated
administrative responsibility for implementing its decisions on compensation and benefits matters to the Chief Human Resources
Officer, who reports to the Committee on the actions taken under this delegation. The Committee seeks the CEO’s views on whether the existing
compensation policies and practices continue to support Verizon’s business and performance objectives, utilize appropriate
performance targets, and appropriately reward the contributions of the other named executive officers. While the Committee values
the CEO’s insight, ultimately the Committee makes an independent determination on all matters related to the compensation
of the named executive officers. Independent compensation consultant. The Committee
has the sole authority to retain and terminate a compensation consultant and to approve all terms of the engagement, including
fees. The Committee retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC as its compensation consultant (Semler Brossy). Semler Brossy
advises the Committee on all matters related to the compensation of our named executive officers and our non-employee Directors.
Semler Brossy’s advisory services include providing current benchmarking data for our peer group and other relevant market
data in our industry and helping the Committee interpret this data, as well as data provided by the Company. Semler Brossy participates
in Committee meetings and confers regularly with the Committee in executive session at those meetings. Committee policy prohibits Semler Brossy from doing any work for
the Company during its engagement, and Semler Brossy did not perform work for the Company in 2023. The Committee made assessments
of Semler Brossy under SEC rules and NYSE and Nasdaq listing standards and concluded that Semler Brossy was independent, and that
its work in 2023 for the Committee did not raise any conflicts of interest. Shareholder feedback on compensation Our Board, the Human Resources Committee and our management team
value shareholder perspectives on our executive compensation program. Management and Directors engage with our institutional shareholders
in meetings and calls throughout the year. Topics of discussion typically include the Committee’s choice of performance measures
for awards issued under our Short- and Long-Term Incentive Plans, the relationship between the performance measures and 23 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information our long-term strategy, the payout terms of equity awards, compensation
recoupment policies and shareholder proposals, and our long-standing practice of including quantitative ESG performance measures
in our Short-Term Plan. In addition to this direct feedback, as part of the Committee’s annual review of the executive compensation
program, the Committee considers the outcome of Verizon’s annual shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation –
the “say-on-pay.” At our Annual Meeting in May 2023, the compensation of our named executive officers was approved
by approximately 91% of votes cast. Based on the perspective obtained from discussions with our long-term shareholders, the results
of our 2023 say-on-pay vote, and the history of strong shareholder support in prior say-on-pay votes, the Committee believes our
shareholders continue to strongly support Verizon’s executive compensation program. Best practices in executive compensation and governance Our compensation program reflects our commitment to industry-leading
standards for compensation design and governance. The Human Resources Committee regularly reviews best practices in executive compensation
and governance and revises our policies and practices when appropriate. The following table highlights some features of our executive
compensation program that demonstrate the rigor of our policies. What we do More information on page Pay for performance Approximately 90% of named executive officers’ total compensation opportunity is variable, incentive-based pay. 26 Focus on performance: Exclude buybacks from EPS results Our adjusted earnings per share (EPS) metric under our Long-Term Incentive Plan (Long-Term Plan) excludes the benefit of any repurchases of Verizon’s common stock under a share buyback program. 32 Robust stock ownership guidelines We have stock ownership guidelines for the CEO of 7x base salary; for other named executive officers of 4x base salary; and for Directors of 5x the cash component of the annual Board retainer. 37 Clawback policies Our clawback policies give us the right to cancel or “claw back” incentive compensation from any senior executive who has engaged in misconduct that results in (i) significant reputational or financial harm to Verizon or (ii) a material financial restatement.  In addition, the Company adopted an additional clawback policy in accordance with final SEC rules and NYSE and Nasdaq listing rules that provides for the mandatory recovery of erroneously awarded “incentive-based compensation” from current and former executive officers in the event that Verizon is required to prepare an accounting restatement. 38 Anti-hedging policy Our anti-hedging policy prohibits Directors and executives who receive equity-based incentive awards from entering into transactions designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Verizon stock that they own. 37 Double-trigger change in control In the event of a change in control, our Long-Term Plan requires an involuntary termination without cause for any accelerated vesting of awards. 37 ESG metric For over 20 years, our short-term incentive program has included an ESG metric. 29 What we don’t do Tax gross-ups We do not provide tax gross-ups to our executive officers or Directors. 36 Dividends on unearned performance awards We do not pay dividends on unearned Performance Stock Units (PSUs) or Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). 31 Employment contracts None of our named executive officers has an employment contract. 37 Guaranteed benefits Over 15 years ago, we froze our defined benefit pension and supplemental executive retirement benefits. 36 24 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Benchmarking total compensation opportunity The Committee evaluates whether the compensation opportunities
for our executives are appropriate and competitive by comparing each named executive officer’s total compensation opportunity
– which represents the sum of the executive’s base salary and target award amounts under the Short-Term Plan and the
Long-Term Plan – to the total compensation opportunities for executives in comparable positions at peer companies, referencing
the 50th percentile when making this comparison. A named executive officer’s total compensation opportunity may be higher
or lower depending upon the executive’s tenure and overall level of responsibility. The peer groups utilized for compensation benchmarking are reviewed
each year. For 2023 compensation decisions, the Committee utilized a peer group that consisted of the companies in the Dow Jones
Industrial (Dow) Average (other than Verizon) with at least $50 billion in annual revenue, plus Verizon’s four largest
industry competitors (AT&T, Charter Communications, Comcast and T-Mobile US) and four large market-capitalization technology
companies (Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Netflix) that were not included in the Dow at the time of the 2023 compensation
decisions, whose applications rely heavily on our network and technology. This is the same peer group selection criteria utilized
for 2022 compensation decisions. Below are the companies included in the Company’s peer group
for 2023 compensation benchmarking purposes. Alphabet Amazon American Express Apple AT&T Boeing Caterpillar Charter Communications Chevron Cisco Comcast Dow Inc. Home Depot IBM Intel Johnson & Johnson JPMorgan Chase Merck Meta Platforms Microsoft Netflix Nike Procter & Gamble T-Mobile US UnitedHealth Group Walgreens Boots Alliance Walmart Walt Disney Compensation objectives and elements of compensation Compensation objectives Verizon’s executive compensation program supports the creation
of shareholder value by pursuing four key objectives: • Attract and retain high-performing executives with the leadership
abilities and experience necessary to drive our customer-focused, technology-enabled strategy, within an enterprise of our scale,
breadth and complexity; • Pay for superior results and sustainable growth by rewarding the
achievement of challenging short- and long-term performance goals designed to build shareholder value; • Drive performance and create shareholder value by emphasizing variable,
at-risk compensation with an appropriate balance of short-term and long-term objectives that align executive and shareholder interests; and • Manage risk through oversight and compensation design features,
policies and practices that strike an appropriate balance between risk and reward. 25 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Elements and mix of compensation to emphasize long-term performance The Committee determines the appropriate balance between fixed
and variable pay elements, short- and long-term pay elements, and cash and equity-based pay elements when setting total compensation
opportunities at competitive levels. Pay element Characteristics Purpose Base salary Annual fixed cash compensation Attract and retain high-performing and experienced executives Short-term incentive opportunity Annual variable cash compensation based on the achievement of
predetermined annual performance measures Motivate executives to achieve short-term performance goals that will establish the foundation for future growth Long-term  incentive opportunity Long-term variable equity awards granted annually as a combination of performance-based stock units and time-based restricted stock units Align executives’ interests with those of shareholders, encourage efforts to grow long-term value, and retain executives The Committee believes that a substantial majority of each named
executive officer’s total compensation opportunity should be variable and at risk in order to emphasize a performance-based
culture. Moreover, since the annual Long-Term Plan awards feature three-year award cycles, with awards consisting of PSUs subject
to both performance-based and time-based vesting requirements and RSUs subject to time-based vesting requirements, we reward sustained
performance and also encourage high-performing executives to remain with Verizon. 2023 total compensation pay mix The following chart illustrates the approximate allocation of
the named executive officers’ 2023 total compensation opportunity between variable, performance-based elements and fixed
pay. The actual percentages vary by individual. In establishing the mix of incentive pay for the named executive
officers, the Committee balances the importance of meeting Verizon’s short-term business goals with the need to create shareholder
value over the longer term. The Committee also considered market data with respect to the mix of annual cash and long-term equity
components for similarly situated executives among the peer group. Based on its review, the Committee established long-term target
compensation opportunities at levels more than three times the annual base salary and short-term incentive target compensation
opportunities of the named executive officers. 26 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Performance target setting The Committee takes a holistic approach to establishing performance
targets under our incentive plans and ensuring that they are aligned with Verizon’s short- and long-term strategic goals.
In establishing performance targets, the Committee recognizes the importance of achieving an appropriate balance between rewarding
executives for strong performance over both the short- and long-term and establishing realistic goals that continue to motivate
and retain executives. As a result, we believe that our Short-Term and Long-Term Plans provide for measurable, rigorous performance
targets that are attainable, but challenge executives to drive business results that generate shareholder value. In setting the performance targets, the Committee considered the
following factors: • Verizon’s
                                         short- and long-term strategy; • Economic,
                                         industry and competitive environments; • The
                                         creation of shareholder value; • The
                                         achievement level against performance targets in the prior year; • Financial
                                         analysts’ consensus estimates for the performance measures over future performance
                                         cycles; • The
                                         correlation among the performance measures and considerations of how Verizon’s
                                         operational performance will affect each measure differently; and • With
                                         regard to the ESG metrics in the Short-Term Plan, Verizon’s strategic plans to
                                         reduce its environmental impact and promote diversity in its workforce and among its
                                         business partners. 2023 annual base salary To determine an executive’s base salary, the Committee,
with assistance from Semler Brossy, considers the pay practices of the peer group for comparable positions; the executive’s
experience, tenure, scope of responsibility and performance; internal pay alignment; continuity planning and management development
considerations; and for newly-hired executives, the Committee also considers the compensation required to attract the executive
to the Company. There is no specific weighting applied to any of these factors in setting annual salaries, and the process ultimately
relies on the subjective exercise of the Committee’s judgment. The Committee took these considerations into account in making
the following base salary determinations for Mr. Sampath, Mr. Malady, Mr. Skiadas, and Mr. Silliman. In March 2023,
when Mr. Sampath was appointed Executive Vice President and Group CEO – Verizon Consumer, and Mr. Malady was appointed
Executive Vice President and Group CEO – Verizon Business, the Committee approved a new base salary for Mr. Sampath of $1,050,000
(an increase of 23.53% from his prior base salary) and a new base salary for Mr. Malady of $1,000,000 (an increase of 11.11% from
his prior base salary), which reflect the scope and breadth of their new positions. The Committee approved a 2023 base salary of
$900,000 for Mr. Silliman in connection with his role as Executive Vice President and President – Verizon Global Services
(an increase of 5.88% from his prior base salary). In addition, the Committee approved a new base salary for Mr. Skiadas of $800,000
(an increase of 28% from his prior base salary in his role as Senior Vice President and Controller) effective on the date Mr. Skiadas
assumed the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in April 2023. Messrs. Vestberg and Ellis did not
receive a base salary increase in 2023. 2023 short-term incentive compensation The Verizon Short-Term Plan motivates executives to achieve challenging
short-term performance targets in order to provide the foundation for future growth. Each year, the Committee establishes the potential
value of the awards under the Short-Term Plan, as well as the performance targets required to achieve these awards. For the 2023 Short-Term Plan, the Committee established a single
set of performance metrics at the Verizon corporate level, based on Verizon’s consolidated results, that apply to all executives,
consistent with the 2022 Short-Term Plan.  The Committee also maintained the same three financial performance measures –
service and other revenue, cash flow from operations and adjusted operating income – as well as the diversity and sustainability
metrics from the 2022 Short-Term Plan.  The Committee evolved the plan design for 2023 by eliminating the qualitative operating
unit and overall leading indicators that were in place for 2022, after taking into consideration the formation of the Verizon Global
Services organization in addition to Verizon’s three operating units – Consumer, Business and Global Network and Technology
(GN&T) – and the desire to focus all employees around a single set of shared strategic goals, further accelerate efficiency
and growth, and emphasize a unified Verizon. 27 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information The Committee set the values of the 2023 Short-Term Plan award
opportunities as a percentage of an executive’s base salary based on both the scope of the executive’s responsibilities
and the competitive pay practices of the peer group used for benchmarking our executives’ total compensation opportunity.
The Short-Term Plan award opportunities at the threshold, target and maximum levels for each of the named executive officers are
shown in the Grants of Plan-based Awards table on page 42. For the named executive officers, other than Mr. Skiadas,
target award opportunities, expressed as a percentage of base salary, did not change for 2023. However, the dollar value of the
2023 target award opportunity for Messrs. Sampath, Malady and Silliman increased from 2022 as a result of the base salary increases
described above. Messrs. Vestberg and Ellis did not receive a salary increase in 2023, so the dollar value of their respective
2023 target award opportunities was the same as it was in 2022. When Mr. Skiadas was promoted to Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer in April 2023, his target award opportunity was increased from 90% to 150% of his base salary on a
prorated basis. The dollar value in the 2023 Short-Term Plan Target Award Opportunity table below reflects this increase. The following table shows the 2023 Short-Term Plan target award
opportunity for each of the named executive officers. 2023 Short-Term Plan target award opportunity Named executive officer As a percentage of base salary As a dollar value Mr. Vestberg 250% $ 3,750,000 Mr. Skiadas* 150% $ 987,500 Mr. Sampath 150% $ 1,575,000 Mr. Malady 150% $ 1,500,000 Mr. Silliman 150% $ 1,350,000 Mr. Ellis** 150% $ 1,425,000 * Mr. Skiadas’s target award opportunity was 90% of his base salary prior to May 2023. The dollar value shown here reflects Mr. Skiadas’s total target award opportunity for 2023 after giving effect to the prorated increase to his target award percentage in April 2023. ** In connection with Mr. Ellis’s involuntary separation from Verizon in April 2023, he was eligible for a prorated 2023 Short-Term Plan award pursuant to the terms of the Verizon Senior Manager Severance Plan based on the Company’s attainment of the 2023 Short-Term Plan annual performance measures. The amount in this table represents Mr. Ellis’s full year 2023 target award opportunity. Annual performance measures In February 2023, the Committee established the performance measures
and targets for the 2023 Short-Term Plan. The Committee established financial, operational and ESG performance measures and targets
at the Verizon corporate level, based on Verizon’s consolidated results.  For each performance measure, the Committee
set a target that challenges executives to drive business results that generate shareholder value. Verizon’s performance
with respect to these applicable measures determines the amount of the short-term incentive awards earned by the named executive
officers. The 2023 performance measures, along with the weighting ascribed
to each, are shown on the following page as a percentage of the total Short-Term Plan award opportunity at target level performance.
The Committee believes that these performance measures are appropriate to motivate Verizon’s executives to achieve outstanding
short-term results and, at the same time, help establish the foundation for long-term value for shareholders. The 2023 measures and related targets approved by the Committee
are described in detail on the following page. 28 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information 2023 Short-Term Plan performance measures and weightings Why these performance measures? The Committee selected service and other revenue, adjusted operating
        income, and cash flow from operations to reflect Verizon’s strategic goals of encouraging profitable operations, growth and
        delivering best-in-class network experiences in a cost efficient manner. Consistent with prior years, the Committee also selected
        diversity and sustainability metrics to reflect Verizon’s commitments to promoting diversity among our employees and our
        business partners and reducing the environmental impact of our operations. Service and other revenue Target range: $109.4 billion to $111.3 billion Service and other revenue is a measure that reflects the extent to which we have been successful in attracting and retaining customers, penetrating key markets with our products and services and creating high-quality growth. The Committee views this measure as an important indicator of Verizon’s growth and success in realizing its strategic initiatives. Adjusted operating income Target range: $30.6 billion to $32.1 billion Adjusted operating income is a measure that reflects operating profitability because it indicates how much profit we generate after subtracting operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization and the other costs of running the business, from total revenue. The Committee views this as an important indicator of how well our management is growing revenue while managing operating costs. Adjusted operating income excludes the effect of special items, which provides more comparable financial results from period to period. Cash flow from operations Target range: $35.3 billion to $37.1 billion Cash flow from operations is a measure of the cash generated from our ongoing, regular business activities and is used to fund expansion and modernization of our networks, service and repay external financing, pay dividends and invest in new businesses and spectrum. ESG metrics Targets: Workforce diversity of 60.6%, diverse supplier spend of $5.5 billion, and carbon intensity reduction of 16.0% ESG metrics relating to diversity and sustainability reinforce
        our corporate purpose to “create the networks that move the world forward.” As a large, multinational company with
        a highly diverse customer and employee base, we know that our operations are strengthened when we leverage the diversity of
        thought and cultures of our workforce and business partners. We are also committed to reducing the environmental impact of our
        operations because we believe that effective emissions and energy management is not only necessary for the transition to a low-carbon
        economy, but also lowers current and future operating costs. Therefore, the Committee utilizes diversity and sustainability metrics
        and targets that measure the percentage of our U.S.-based workforce that is comprised of women and minorities ( workforce diversity ),
        the amount of our overall annual supplier spend with, or directed to, diverse firms ( diverse supplier spend ) and the percentage
        by which we reduce our carbon intensity – the amount of carbon our business emits divided by the terabytes of data we transport
        over our networks – as compared to the prior year ( carbon intensity reduction ). 29 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information 2023 adjusted company results 1 The Short-Term Plan provides for performance measures to be adjusted
to exclude the impact of certain types of events not contemplated at the time the performance measures were set, such as significant
transactions, changes in legal or regulatory policy and other special items. The Committee did not make any adjustments in determining
Verizon’s performance against the performance measures. $109.7B Service and other revenue $31.1B Adjusted operating income $37.5B Cash flow from operations 60.3% U.S.-based workforce comprised of women

the Verizon corporate measures and targets set forth above, the Committee approved a payout percentage for all of the employees
participating in the Short-Term Plan of 109%. The following table shows the actual Short-Term Plan award earned
by each named executive officer based on the payout percentages detailed above. Named executive officer Target award x Payout percentage = Actual award Mr. Vestberg $ 3,750,000 109% $ 4,087,500 Mr. Skiadas* $ 987,500 109% $ 1,076,375 Mr. Sampath $ 1,575,000 109% $ 1,716,750 Mr. Malady $ 1,500,000 109% $ 1,635,000 Mr. Silliman $ 1,350,000 109% $ 1,471,500 Mr. Ellis** $ 1,425,000 109% $ 517,750 * The dollar values shown for Mr. Skiadas’s target award and actual award reflect Mr. Skiadas’s total target award opportunity for 2023 after giving effect to the prorated increase to his target award percentage in April 2023. ** Mr. Ellis’s actual award was prorated to reflect his involuntary separation from Verizon on April 29, 2023. 30 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Long-term incentive compensation The Long-Term Plan is intended to align executives’ and shareholders’ interests and to reward
participants for creating long-term shareholder value. Annual Long-Term Plan awards are made in PSUs and RSUs. The value of each PSU or RSU is equal to the
value of one share of Verizon common stock. The Committee assumes each executive will earn 100% of the PSUs and RSUs awarded for
purposes of determining the total compensation opportunity. PSUs and RSUs accrue dividend equivalents that are deemed to be reinvested
in PSUs and RSUs, respectively. These dividend equivalents are paid when, and only to the extent that, the related PSUs and RSUs
are actually earned. PSUs are earned over a three-year performance cycle, with cliff vesting at the end of the three-year period.
The Committee believes that a three-year performance cycle is appropriate for the PSU awards because a multi-year performance
cycle measures the effectiveness of management’s execution of long-term strategies and the effect on shareholder value.
RSUs vest ratably over three years (as opposed to a single, longer cliff vesting schedule), which aligns with market practice
and enables us to continue to attract and retain key executive talent. The 2023 Long-Term Plan awards for executives other than Mr. Vestberg, were comprised of 60% PSUs and
40% RSUs, consistent with prior years.  Mr. Vestberg’s 2023 award was comprised of 67% PSUs and 33% RSUs.  The
Committee retained the PSU performance metrics and weightings from the 2022 awards, with one-third based on Verizon’s cumulative
free cash flow, one-third based on Verizon’s adjusted EPS and one-third based on Verizon’s service and other revenue
over the three-year performance period. The Committee also retained relative total shareholder return (TSR) as a modifier to the
PSU vesting percentage as compared against the companies in the S&P 100. The number of PSUs actually earned and paid is determined based upon Verizon’s achievement of pre-established
performance targets over the three-year performance cycle, and the ultimate value of each PSU depends on Verizon’s stock
price. Because the value of PSUs is linked to both stock price and performance targets, PSUs provide a strong incentive to executives
to deliver value to Verizon’s shareholders. RSUs also provide a performance link as the value of the award depends on Verizon’s
stock price. Both PSUs and RSUs provide a retention incentive by requiring the executive to remain employed with Verizon through
the end of the applicable vesting period, subject to certain qualifying separations. The 2023 PSUs and RSUs are payable in shares
of Verizon stock. 2023 Long-Term Plan award opportunities The Committee set the annual target long-term incentive
award levels to create an appropriate total compensation opportunity for the named executive officers in light of the
Committee’s reference of the 50 th percentile for comparable executives within the peer group and the
compensation mix considerations described above, and taking into account market practices for each individual’s role
and responsibilities, the individual’s performance, the strategic impact of the individual’s role and internal
pay alignment. The 2023 target award opportunity for the named executive officers was allocated between PSUs and RSUs
as noted above, and the target award opportunity allocated to each type of award was converted into a target number of units using
the closing price of Verizon’s common stock on the grant date. 2023 Long-Term Plan target award opportunity Named executive officer As a dollar value Mr. Vestberg $ 18,000,000 Mr. Skiadas* $ 7,000,000 Mr. Sampath $ 8,500,000 Mr. Malady $ 8,000,000 Mr. Silliman $ 7,500,000 Mr. Ellis $ 7,000,000 * The dollar value for Mr. Skiadas reflects the total target award opportunity for 2023 after giving
    effect to the prorated incremental award granted in May 2023 upon his promotion to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
    Officer. 31 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Each of the named executive officers other than Mr. Vestberg, received 60% of his 2023 Long-Term Plan
award in the form of PSUs and 40% in the form of RSUs, consistent with past practice, which the Committee believes incentivizes
our executives to focus on our long-term operational goals and to deliver TSR performance, as well as encourages retention among
our highly-qualified team.  For Mr. Vestberg, the Committee increased the mix of PSUs to 67% of his 2023 award, and reduced
the RSUs to 33% of his award, which further emphasizes the importance of Mr. Vestberg delivering on our long-term operational
goals and TSR performance. One-third of the 2023 PSUs is eligible to vest based on Verizon’s cumulative adjusted EPS, one-third
is eligible to vest based on Verizon’s cumulative free cash flow and one-third is eligible to vest based on Verizon’s
service and other revenue. The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest may be decreased or increased by up to 25% depending on
Verizon’s TSR position at the end of the three-year period compared with the companies in the S&P 100 as constituted
on the date the awards were granted. Terms of 2023 PSU awards Adjusted earnings per share metric One-third of the 2023 PSUs will vest based on Verizon’s cumulative adjusted earnings per share
(EPS PSUs). The percentage of the EPS PSUs awarded for the 2023-2025 performance cycle that will vest is based on the extent to
which Verizon’s cumulative adjusted EPS over the performance cycle meets or exceeds the cumulative adjusted EPS performance
levels set by the Committee at the beginning of the performance cycle. Adjusted EPS is defined as Verizon’s cumulative earnings
per share over the three-year performance period, adjusted to exclude the impact of special items, including the benefit of any
repurchases of Verizon’s common stock under a share buyback program, and is subject to adjustment to eliminate the financial
impact of significant transactions, changes in legal or regulatory policy and other extraordinary items. The cumulative adjusted EPS target for the 2023-2025 performance cycle was set at a level reflective
of our three-year strategic plan, which the Committee believes is attainable, but challenging in light of the business environment.
The number of EPS PSUs that will vest ranges from 0%, if actual performance is below the threshold level, to 200%, if actual performance
is at or above the maximum cumulative EPS level. The number of EPS PSUs that will vest in-between identified performance levels
is determined by linear interpolation between vesting percentage levels. Free cash flow metric One-third of the 2023 PSUs will vest based on Verizon’s cumulative free cash flow (FCF PSUs). The
percentage of the FCF PSUs awarded for the 2023-2025 performance cycle that will vest is based on the extent to which Verizon’s
cumulative free cash flow over the performance cycle meets or exceeds the cumulative free cash flow performance levels set by
the Committee at the beginning of the performance cycle. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from
the total of cash flow from operations and is subject to adjustment to eliminate the financial impact of significant transactions,
changes in legal or regulatory policy and other extraordinary items. The cumulative free cash flow target for the 2023-2025 performance cycle was set at a level reflective
of our three-year strategic plan, which the Committee believes is attainable, but challenging in light of the business environment.
The number of FCF PSUs that will vest ranges from 0%, if actual performance is below the threshold level, to 200%, if actual performance
is at or above the maximum cumulative free cash flow level. The number of FCF PSUs that will vest in-between identified performance
levels is determined by linear interpolation between vesting percentage levels. 32 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Service and other revenue metric One-third of the 2023 PSUs will vest based on Verizon’s cumulative service and other revenue (SOR
PSUs). The percentage of the SOR PSUs awarded for the 2023-2025 performance cycle that will vest is based on the extent to which
Verizon’s cumulative service and other revenue over the performance cycle meets or exceeds the cumulative service and other
revenue performance levels set by the Committee at the beginning of the performance cycle. Service and other revenue is defined
as Verizon’s cumulative revenue generated from Verizon’s wireless and wireline businesses, excluding revenue related
to wireless equipment, on a consolidated basis over the performance cycle, subject to adjustment to eliminate the financial impact
of significant transactions, changes in legal or regulatory policy and other extraordinary items. The cumulative service and other revenue target for the 2023-2025 performance cycle was set at a level
reflective of our three-year strategic plan, which the Committee believes is attainable, but challenging in light of the business
environment. The number of SOR PSUs that will vest ranges from 0%, if actual performance is below the threshold level, to 200%,
if actual performance is at or above the maximum cumulative service and other revenue level. The number of SOR PSUs that will
vest in-between identified performance levels is determined by linear interpolation between vesting percentage levels. Total shareholder return modifier After the Committee determines the extent to which the EPS PSU,
FCF PSU and SOR PSU performance measures have been achieved, the overall PSU vesting percentage may be increased or decreased
by up to 25% depending on Verizon’s TSR position compared with the companies in the S&P 100 as constituted on the date
the awards were granted. If Verizon ranks at or above the 75 th percentile, 25% will be added to the PSU vesting
percentage (up to a maximum payout of 200%). If Verizon ranks at or below the 25 th percentile, 25% will be subtracted
from the PSU vesting percentage. If Verizon ranks at the median, there will be no change to the PSU vesting percentage, and for
ranks in between the 25 th and 75 th percentile, the modifier will be determined by linear interpolation
between the levels. Why these performance measures? The Committee selected adjusted EPS, free cash flow and service and other revenue to focus our
        executives on our long-term operational goals, with cumulative adjusted EPS focusing on our profitability, cumulative
        free cash flow focusing on our ability to generate cash from operations and cumulative service and other revenue focusing
        on our ability to be successful in attracting and retaining customers, penetrating key markets with our products and services
        and creating high-quality growth. The TSR modifier is a valuable indicator of our success because it measures our performance
        in returning value to our shareholders in comparison to alternative investments our shareholders could have made. For
        purposes of measuring our TSR positioning, the Committee utilizes the companies in the S&P 100 index because the Committee
        believes that it balances having companies comparable to Verizon’s size in the comparator group with having a large
        enough number of companies to ensure that no one company overly impacts the outcomes in a given year and, further, that
        the S&P 100 is a recognized index, which is easy for shareholders and employees to track and understand. 33 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information 2021 PSU awards earned in 2023 With respect to the PSUs awarded in 2021, the Committee determined the number of PSUs that vested for
a participant based on the level of achievement of two performance metrics over the three-year performance cycle –
adjusted EPS and free cash flow – subject to adjustment depending on Verizon’s TSR position at the end of the three-year
period compared with the companies in the S&P 100 as constituted on the date the awards were granted. 2021-2023 EPS PSUs. Fifty-percent of the PSUs awarded were eligible to vest based on Verizon’s
cumulative adjusted EPS over the 2021-2023 performance cycle compared to the performance targets set by the Committee at the beginning
of the three-year cycle. The following table shows the percentage of EPS PSUs awarded that would vest based on Verizon’s
cumulative adjusted EPS over the 2021-2023 performance cycle at different performance levels. Verizon’s
    cumulative adjusted EPS 1 EPS vested percentage 2 Greater than or equal to $17.00 200% $16.50 150% $15.94 100% $15.00 50% Less than $15.00 0% 1 Adjusted EPS is defined as Verizon’s cumulative earnings per share over the three-year performance
    period, adjusted to exclude the impact of special items, including the benefit of any repurchases of Verizon’s common
    stock under a share buyback program, and is subject to adjustment to eliminate the financial impact of significant transactions,
    changes in legal or regulatory policy and other extraordinary items. 2 For achievement between the stated levels, vesting is determined by linear interpolation. At the time the 2021-2023 award was granted, the Committee provided for the EPS metric to be determined
on an adjusted basis, to preserve the intended incentives by excluding the impact of certain types of events not contemplated
by our financial plan, such as significant transactions, changes in legal or regulatory policy and other special items. In determining
Verizon’s adjusted EPS over the performance cycle, the Committee made adjustments to normalize the impacts of strategic
transactions, including amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and impacts resulting from the 2021 acquisition
of C-Band spectrum through the Federal Trade Commission’s Auction 107 (C-Band Acquisition), each of which were not contemplated
when the EPS PSU targets were set. These adjustments are set forth in Appendix B. In accordance with this pre-established adjustment
methodology, the Committee determined that Verizon’s adjusted EPS over the performance cycle was $14.73, which resulted
in a vesting percentage of 0% for the EPS PSUs. 2021-2023 FCF PSUs . Fifty-percent of the PSUs awarded were eligible to vest based on Verizon’s
cumulative free cash flow over the 2021-2023 performance cycle compared to the performance targets set by the Committee at the
beginning of the three-year cycle. The following table shows the percentage of FCF PSUs awarded that would vest based on Verizon’s
cumulative free cash flow over the 2021-2023 performance cycle at different performance levels. Verizon’s
    cumulative free cash flow 1 (in billions) FCF
    vested percentage 2 Greater than $62.5 200% $57.6 150% $52.8 100% $43.8 50% Less than $43.8 0% 1 Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the total of cash flow from operations. 2 For achievement between the stated levels, vesting is determined by linear interpolation. 34 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information At the time the 2021-2023 award was granted, the Committee provided for free cash flow to be determined
on an adjusted basis, to preserve the intended incentives by excluding the impact of certain types of events not contemplated
by our financial plan, such as significant transactions, changes in legal or regulatory policy and other special items. In determining
Verizon’s free cash flow over the performance cycle, the Committee made adjustments to normalize the impacts of the C-Band
Acquisition on free cash flow results, which were not contemplated when the FCF PSU targets were set. These adjustments are set
forth in Appendix B. In accordance with this pre-established adjustment methodology, the Committee determined that Verizon’s
cumulative free cash flow over the performance cycle was $48.7 billion, which resulted in a vesting percentage of 77% for the
FCF PSUs. Relative total shareholder return modifier. After
the Committee determined the extent to which the EPS PSU and FCF PSU performance measures have been achieved, the overall PSU
vesting percentage could be increased or decreased by up to 25% depending on Verizon’s TSR position compared with the companies
in the S&P 100 as constituted on the date the awards were granted. If Verizon ranked at or above the 75 th percentile,
25% would be added to the PSU vesting percentage (up to a maximum payout of 200%). If Verizon ranked at or below the 25 th percentile,
25% would be subtracted from the PSU vesting percentage. If Verizon ranked at the median, there would be no change to the PSU
vesting percentage, and for ranks in between the 25 th and 75 th percentile, the modifier would
be determined by linear interpolation between the levels. Over the three-year performance cycle ending December 31, 2023,
Verizon’s TSR ranked 92 nd among the S&P 100 as constituted on the date the awards were granted, resulting
in 25% being subtracted from the final PSU vesting percentage. 2021-2023 relative TSR modifier based on Verizon’s TSR rank among S&P 100 2021-2023 PSU payout. Based on the results described above, in the first quarter of 2024
the Committee approved a payment to our named executive officers of 14% of the PSUs awarded for the 2021-2023 performance cycle,
which represents the weighted average of the EPS PSU and FCF PSU vesting percentages described above, minus 25% as a result
of the TSR modifier, plus dividend equivalents credited on those vested PSUs. Mr. Vestberg’s 2018 special one-time equity award earned When Mr. Vestberg was appointed CEO in August 2018, the Committee recommended, and the independent members
of the Board approved, a special one-time equity award to Mr. Vestberg under the Long-Term Plan to provide an additional incentive
to drive Verizon’s return on equity (ROE) over a five-year performance period.  The award was granted on August 1,
2018 and was entirely performance-based in the form of PSUs.  The PSUs represented shares of Verizon common stock that would
become payable after the completion of a five-year performance cycle ending on July 31, 2023, provided that the pre-established
performance criterion was achieved and Mr. Vestberg remained employed throughout the performance cycle. The number of PSUs that
were eligible to vest would be determined based on Verizon’s average annual ROE during the performance cycle. No PSUs would
vest unless Verizon’s average annual ROE met the minimum threshold percentage of 18%. If Verizon’s average annual
ROE met the target percentage of 28%, 100% of the nominal number of the PSUs granted would vest and a maximum of two times the
nominal number of PSUs granted would vest if Verizon’s average annual ROE was at least 38% at the conclusion of the performance
cycle. If Verizon’s average annual ROE during the five-year performance cycle was greater than 18% but less than 28%, or
was greater than 28% but less than 38%, the percentage of the PSUs granted that would vest would be determined on an interpolated
scale.  In September 2023, the Committee determined that Verizon’s average annual ROE was 28% over the five-year performance
cycle ending on July 31, 2023. As a result, the Committee recommended, and the independent members of the Board approved, a payment
of 100% of the number of PSUs awarded, plus accrued dividends credited on those PSUs. The PSUs were paid in shares in accordance
with the terms of the award, and Mr. Vestberg is required to hold the shares he received (net of tax withholding) for at least
two years following the vesting date unless he dies or becomes disabled. 35 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Committee actions taken after fiscal year 2023 In January 2024, the Committee approved a compensation increase for Mr. Skiadas based on its assessment
of the market competitiveness of his total compensation opportunity, his tenure and experience and internal pay equity considerations.
 Mr. Skiadas's base salary increased from $800,000 to $1,000,000, effective January 1, 2024, and his target long-term
incentive opportunity increased from $7,000,000 to $8,500,000. Other elements of the compensation program Verizon also provides the named executive officers with limited additional benefits as generally described
below, which are subject to applicable taxes and not intended to be a significant portion of their overall pay package. No named
executive officer is eligible for a tax gross-up payment in connection with any of these benefits, including with respect to excise
tax liability arising from any Internal Revenue Code Section 280G excess parachute payments. Personal benefits Transportation. Verizon provides limited aircraft and ground transportation benefits to enhance
the safety and security of certain named executive officers. These transportation benefits also serve business purposes, such
as allowing an executive to attend to confidential business matters while in transit. Executive life insurance. Verizon offers the named executive officers and other executives
the opportunity to participate in an executive life insurance program in lieu of participating in our basic and supplemental life
insurance programs. The executives who elect to participate in the executive life insurance program own the life insurance policy,
and Verizon provides an annual cash payment to defray a portion of the annual premiums. Financial planning. Verizon provides a voluntary Company-sponsored financial planning benefit
program for the named executive officers and other executives. If an executive participates in the program, the cost of the financial
planning benefit is included in the executive’s income. For additional information on these benefits, see footnote 5 to the Summary Compensation table on page
40. Retirement benefits Over 15 years ago, the Committee determined that guaranteed pay in the form of defined benefit pension
and supplemental executive retirement benefits was not consistent with Verizon’s pay-for-performance culture. Accordingly,
effective June 30, 2006, Verizon froze all future pension accruals under its management tax-qualified and supplemental defined
benefit retirement plans. These legacy retirement benefits that were previously provided to certain executives, including Messrs.
Malady and Silliman, are described in more detail under the section titled “Pension plans” beginning on page 45. During 2023, all of Verizon’s named executive officers were eligible to participate in Verizon’s
tax-qualified defined contribution savings plan, the Verizon Management Savings Plan, referred to as the Savings Plan, and Verizon’s
nonqualified defined contribution savings plan, the Verizon Executive Deferral Plan, referred to as the Deferral Plan. The named
executive officers participate in these plans on the same terms as other participants in the plans. Under the Savings Plan, executives
may defer “eligible pay,” which includes base salary up to certain compensation limits imposed by the Internal Revenue
Code, and Verizon provides a matching contribution equal to 100% of the first 6% of eligible pay deferred. The Deferral Plan is
designed to “restore” benefits that are limited or cut back under the Savings Plan due to the Internal Revenue Code
limits. Accordingly, under the Deferral Plan, a participant may elect to defer his or her base pay and short-term incentive that
could not be deferred into the Savings Plan due to the Internal Revenue Code limits. Verizon provides the same matching contribution
on these deferred amounts as the participant would have received if such amounts had been permitted to be deferred into the Savings
Plan. Severance and change in control benefits The Committee believes that maintaining a competitive level of separation benefits is appropriate as
part of an overall program designed to attract, retain and motivate the highest-quality management team. However, the Committee
does not believe that named executive officers should be entitled to receive cash severance benefits merely because a change in
control occurs. Therefore, the payment of cash severance benefits is triggered only by an actual or constructive termination of
employment. 36 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Verizon was not a party to any employment agreement with any of the named executive officers in 2023.
All senior managers (including all named executive officers except Mr. Vestberg) are eligible to participate in the Verizon
Senior Manager Severance Plan, which provides certain separation benefits to participants whose employment is involuntarily terminated
without cause. As CEO, Mr. Vestberg is not eligible to participate in the Senior Manager Severance Plan and is not entitled
to receive any cash severance benefits upon his separation from the Company. The Senior Manager Severance Plan is generally consistent with the terms and conditions of Verizon’s
broad-based severance plan for management employees other than senior managers. Under the Senior Manager Severance Plan, if a
participant has been involuntarily terminated without cause (or, in the case of a named executive officer, if the independent
members of the Board determine that there has been a qualifying separation), the participant is eligible to receive a lump-sum
cash separation payment equal to a multiple of his or her base salary plus target short-term incentive opportunity, along with
continuing medical, dental and vision coverage for the applicable severance period. To the extent that a senior manager is eligible
for severance benefits under any other arrangement, that person may not receive any duplicative benefits under the Senior Manager
Severance Plan. The Senior Manager Severance Plan does not provide for any severance benefits based upon a change in control of
the Company. Under the Senior Manager Severance Plan, each named executive officer, other than Mr. Vestberg,
is eligible to receive a cash separation payment equal to two times the sum of his or her base salary and target short-term incentive
opportunity. To be eligible for any severance benefits, a participant must execute a release of claims against Verizon in the
form satisfactory to Verizon and agree not to compete or interfere with any Verizon business for a period of one year after separation. Mr. Ellis became entitled to separation benefits under the Senior Manager Severance Plan upon his involuntary
separation from Verizon effective April 29, 2023, which are described in more detail on page 53. Mr. Ellis. Mr. Ellis did not receive
any enhanced benefits upon his separation from service. Consistent with the Committee’s belief that named executive officers should not receive cash severance
benefits merely because a change in control occurs, the Long-Term Plan does not allow “single-trigger” accelerated
vesting and payment of outstanding awards upon a change in control. Instead, the Long-Term Plan requires a “double trigger.”
Specifically, if in the 12 months following a change in control a participant’s employment is terminated without cause,
all of that participant’s then-unvested PSUs will fully vest at the target level performance, then-unvested RSUs will fully
vest, and those PSUs and RSUs (including accrued dividend equivalents) will become payable on the regularly scheduled payment
date after the end of the applicable award cycle. Other compensation policies Stock ownership guidelines To further align the interests of Verizon’s management with those of our shareholders, the Committee
has approved guidelines that require each named executive officer and other executives to maintain certain stock ownership levels
within five years of assuming their leadership roles. • The CEO is required to maintain share ownership equal to at least seven times base salary. • Other named executive officers are required to maintain share ownership equal to at least four times base salary. In determining whether an executive meets the required ownership level, the calculation includes any
shares held by the executive directly or through a broker, shares held through the Verizon tax-qualified savings plan or the Verizon
nonqualified savings plan and other deferred compensation plans and arrangements that are valued by reference to Verizon’s
stock. The calculation does not include any unvested PSUs or RSUs. Each of the named executive officers is in compliance with
the stock ownership guidelines. In addition, none of the named executive officers has engaged in any pledging transaction with
respect to shares of Verizon’s stock. Policy on hedging Company stock Verizon believes that ownership of Verizon stock by the Company’s executives and members of the
Board of Directors promotes alignment of the interests of the Company’s leadership with those of its stockholders. Verizon
recognizes that transactions that are designed to hedge or offset declines in the market value of Verizon stock can disrupt this
alignment. Hedging transactions allow the holder to own Verizon stock without the full risks and rewards of ownership, potentially
separating the holder’s interests from those of other Verizon shareholders. Therefore, all employees receiving equity-based
awards with respect to Verizon stock and members of the Verizon Board of Directors are prohibited from engaging in any transaction
involving Verizon stock that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Verizon stock beneficially owned
by the employee or Director. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, buying and/or writing puts and calls, prepaid variable
forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds. 37 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information In addition, the Verizon Code of Conduct prohibits all employees from engaging in any transaction that
permits them to benefit from the devaluation of Verizon’s stock, bonds, or other securities, including engaging in short
selling or buying “put” options on Verizon stock. Holding executives accountable – Verizon’s clawback policies The Committee believes it is appropriate to hold senior executives accountable for misconduct that results
in significant reputational or financial harm to Verizon. Accordingly, the Committee has adopted the following policies: • Senior executive clawback policy. Verizon has the right to cancel or “claw back”
    the cash- and equity-based incentive compensation of senior executives who engage in willful misconduct in the performance
    of their duties that results in significant reputational or financial harm to Verizon. • Long-Term Plan clawback provisions. Annual equity grants under the Verizon Long-Term Plan give the Company the
    right to (i) require the recipient to forfeit or repay incentive-based compensation (both short-term and long-term) if
    Verizon is required to materially restate its financial results based on the individual’s willful misconduct or gross
    negligence while employed by the Company (where such restatement would have resulted in a lower payment being made to the
    individual) and (ii) enforce any right or obligation that Verizon may have regarding the clawback of incentive-based
    compensation under federal securities or other applicable laws. The Committee also adopted an additional clawback policy with an effective date of October 2, 2023, in
compliance with the final clawback rules adopted by the SEC and the listing standards of the NYSE and Nasdaq (Clawback Rules).
 This additional clawback policy generally provides for the mandatory recovery of erroneously awarded “incentive-based
compensation” (as defined in the Clawback Rules) from current and former executive officers in the event that Verizon is
required to prepare an accounting restatement, in accordance with the Clawback Rules. A copy of this clawback policy is filed
as an exhibit to Verizon’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These policies do not limit any other rights or remedies Verizon may have in the circumstances, such
as terminating the executive or initiating other disciplinary procedures. Disclosure of any clawbacks will be made in accordance
with applicable law and listing requirements. Shareholder approval of certain severance arrangements The Committee has a policy of seeking shareholder approval or ratification of any new employment or severance
agreement with an executive officer that provides for a total cash value severance payment exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the
executive’s base salary plus Short-Term Plan target opportunity. The policy defines severance pay broadly to include
payments for any consulting services, payments to secure a non-compete agreement, payments to settle any litigation or claim,
payments to offset tax liabilities, payments or benefits that are not generally available to similarly situated management employees
and payments in excess of, or outside, the terms of a Verizon plan or policy. Tax and accounting considerations A publicly-held company is generally prohibited from deducting compensation paid to a current or former
named executive officer that exceeds $1 million during the tax year. The Committee takes this deductibility limitation into
account in its consideration of compensation matters. However, the Committee has the flexibility to take any compensation-related
actions that it determines are in the best interests of Verizon and our shareholders, including awarding compensation that may
not be deductible for tax purposes. The Committee also considers the effect of certain accounting rules that apply to the various aspects
of the compensation program for our named executive officers. The Committee reviews potential accounting effects in determining
whether its compensation actions are in the best interests of Verizon and our shareholders. 38 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Compensation Committee Report The Human Resources Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with

    flight hours by the incremental aircraft cost per hour. The incremental aircraft cost per hour is derived by adding the annual
    aircraft maintenance costs, fuel costs, aircraft trip expenses and crew trip expenses, and then dividing by the total annual
    flight hours. b The aggregate incremental cost of the personal use of a Company vehicle is determined by (i) calculating
    the incremental vehicle cost per mile by dividing the annual lease and fuel costs by the total annual miles; (ii) multiplying
    the executive’s total 2023 personal miles by the incremental vehicle cost per mile; and (iii) adding the incremental
    driver cost (the total 2023 driver hours for the executive’s personal use multiplied by the driver’s hourly rate). c Executive life insurance is available to U.S.-based executives on a voluntary basis. Executives
    who choose to participate in this program are excluded from the basic and supplemental life insurance programs that Verizon
    provides to management employees. The executive owns the insurance policy, chooses the level of coverage and is responsible
    for paying the premiums. However, Verizon pays each executive an amount, shown in this column, which is equal to a portion
    of the premium. Executives who choose not to participate in the executive life insurance plan do not receive that payment.
    For Messrs. Vestberg, Skiadas and Sampath, the executive life insurance policy provides a death benefit equal to five times
    the sum of the executive’s base salary plus his Short-Term Plan award opportunity at 75% of target level (capped at
    $10 million for Mr. Vestberg and capped at $8 million for Messrs. Skiadas and Sampath) if the executive
    dies before a designated date. For Messrs. Malady, Silliman and Ellis, the executive life insurance policy provides a death
    benefit equal to two times the sum of the executive’s base salary plus his Short-Term Plan award opportunity at 75% of target
    level if the executive dies before a designated date. This date is the latest of the participant’s retirement date,
    the date on which the participant reaches age 60 or the fifth anniversary of plan participation. d For Mr. Ellis, the amount in this column represents the benefits payable under the Verizon Senior
    Manager Severance Plan in connection with his involuntary separation from the Company without cause on April 29, 2023 in the
    amount of $4,856,529 which consists of a cash severance benefit in the amount of $4,750,000, the Company’s estimated
    cost of providing medical, dental and vision coverage for two years in the amount of $60,797, the cost of providing outplacement
    services for one year in the amount of $14,500, financial planning benefits in the amount of $13,000 and an estimated payment
    of $18,232 to pay a portion of the annual premium for the executive life insurance policy owned by Mr. Ellis for one
    year following his separation date. e This column represents the total amount of other perquisites and personal benefits provided.
    These other benefits consist of financial planning services in the amount of $21,300 for Mr. Vestberg, $11,000 for Mr. Skiadas,
    $13,000 for Mr. Sampath, $13,000 for Mr. Malady, $13,000 for Mr. Silliman, and $4,298 for Mr. Ellis; and $1,984 for

    cycle, payouts can range from 0% to 200% of the target number of units awarded. One-third of the 2023 PSUs is eligible to
    vest based on Verizon’s cumulative free cash flow, one-third is eligible to vest based Verizon’s cumulative adjusted
    EPS and one-third is eligible to vest based on Verizon’s cumulative service and other revenue; and the number of PSUs
    that will ultimately vest may be increased or decreased by up to 25% (up to a maximum payout of 200%) depending on Verizon’s
    TSR position at the end of the three-year period compared with the companies in the S&P 100 as constituted on the date
    the awards were granted as described in more detail beginning on page 31.
    PSUs and the applicable dividend equivalents are paid only if and to the extent that the applicable performance criteria for
    the award are achieved at the end of the award cycle. When dividends are distributed to shareholders, dividend equivalents
    are credited on the PSU awards in an amount equal to the dollar amount of dividends that would be payable on the total number
    of PSUs credited as of the dividend distribution date and divided by the closing price of the Company’s common stock

and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans in 2006. None of the named executive officers other than Messrs. Malady and Silliman
are eligible for a pension benefit. Verizon Wireless Retirement Plan component of the Verizon Management
Pension Plan. In 2001, Verizon Wireless consolidated the pension plans of several predecessor companies under the Verizon Wireless
Retirement Plan. Effective December 31, 2017, Verizon merged the Verizon Wireless Retirement Plan into the Verizon Management
Pension Plan (VMPP) and established it as a separate component plan within the VMPP. Mr. Malady is entitled to a tax-qualified benefit
under this plan. Mr. Malady’s tax-qualified benefit was determined as follows:
for the period from January 1, 2001 until May 31, 2004, a cash balance formula that provided pay credits equal
to two percent of annual eligible pay up to the IRS compensation limit (under the cash balance formula, a participant’s account
balance is also credited on an ongoing basis with interest credits based upon the 30-year Treasury bond). The normal retirement age under
the Verizon Wireless Retirement Plan is 65. Since there are no reductions applied to cash balance formula benefits, age 65 is used as
Mr. Malady’s earliest unreduced retirement age. For Mr. Malady, eligible pay consisted of base salary and the
Short-Term Plan award. No participant under the plan was eligible for cash balance credits under the nonqualified portion
of the plan. 45 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information The Pension Plan for Employees of MCI Communications Corporation and
Subsidiaries component of the Verizon Management Pension Plan. In conjunction with the acquisition of MCI Communication Corporation
in 2006, Verizon acquired The Pension Plan for Employees of MCI Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries. Benefits under this plan
were previously frozen by MCI effective December 31, 1998. This pension plan was merged into the Verizon Management Pension Plan
but maintained as a separate component within that plan. Mr. Silliman accrued a tax-qualified benefit under a cash balance
formula in this plan and his benefit was determined as follows: for the period from September 22, 1997 until December 31, 1998,
a cash balance formula that provided pay credits ranging from two percent to six and one-half percent based on age of annual
eligible pay up to the IRS compensation limit (under the cash balance formula, a participant’s account balance is also credited
on an ongoing basis with interest credits defined in the plan document but no less than 4.04% per year). The normal retirement age under
the MCI Plan is 65. Since there are no reductions applied to cash balance formula benefits, age 65 is used as Mr. Silliman’s
earliest unreduced retirement age. For Mr. Silliman, eligible pay consisted of base salary and the Short-Term Plan award.
Mr. Silliman did not receive cash balance credits under the nonqualified portion of the plan. The following table illustrates the actuarial present value as of December 31,

statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, as included in Verizon’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, in accordance
with the requirements for this table, the values are calculated using the executive’s retirement at the earliest age at which they
can retire without having the retirement benefit reduced under the plan. Defined contribution savings plans The named executive officers are participants in the Company’s
tax-qualified defined contribution savings plan, the Verizon Management Savings Plan, which is referred to as the Savings Plan, and its
nonqualified defined contribution savings plan, the Verizon Executive Deferral Plan, which is referred to as the Deferral Plan. The named
executive officers who participate in these plans are subject to the same terms as other participants in these plans. Under the Savings Plan, executives may defer “eligible pay,”
which includes base salary up to certain compensation limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, and Verizon provides a matching contribution
equal to 100% of the first 6% of eligible pay deferred. The Deferral Plan is designed to restore benefits that are limited or cut back
under the Savings Plan. Accordingly, under the Deferral Plan, a participant may elect to defer his or her base pay and Short-Term Plan
award that could not be deferred into the Savings Plan due to the Internal Revenue Code limits. Verizon provides the same matching contribution
on these deferred amounts as the participant would have received if such amounts had been permitted to be deferred into the Savings Plan.
Prior to 2018, participants were permitted to defer certain long-term incentive awards under the Deferral Plan (those deferrals were not
eligible for Company match). Deferrals of long-term incentive awards were no longer permitted after 2017. Long-term incentive awards deferred
prior to 2018 remain subject to the terms of the award and the applicable deferral election. Participants in the Deferral Plan may elect to invest their deferrals
in the hypothetical investment options available to all participants under the Savings Plan or in a hypothetical cash account that earns
a return rate equal to the long-term, high-grade corporate bond yield average as published by Moody’s Investor Services. Under SEC
rules, earnings on balances invested in this option may be reportable as “above market” interest in the Summary Compensation
table of the proxy statement in any given year if the rate of interest exceeds 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate at the time
the plan interest rate or formula was originally established. Participants in the Deferral Plan may generally elect to receive their benefits
in a lump sum or installments, commencing on a separation from service or specific date elected by the participant. 46 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Messrs. Skiadas and Malady also have an account balance under the
Verizon Wireless Executive Savings Plan (ESP). The ESP is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that was amended to freeze the accrual
of benefits under the plan as of the close of business on December 31, 2004. Participants in the ESP no longer accrue any additional
benefits other than market-based investment earnings or losses on their individual accounts. No new deferrals were permitted after
2004. Participants retain the ability to invest their frozen accounts in the investment options available under the ESP. Participants
in the ESP do not receive matching contribution credits or retirement credits under the plan. The Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table below shows the 2023 account

In the event of a termination for cause, no amount would have been payable under these awards. Potential payments upon qualifying separation or involuntary termination
without cause Mr. Vestberg. As CEO, Mr. Vestberg is not eligible
to participate in the Senior Manager Severance Plan described below. Mr. Vestberg is also not a party to an employment agreement
with Verizon or any other agreement that would provide him with cash severance benefits in the event his employment is involuntarily
terminated by Verizon without cause. Senior Manager Severance Plan. Verizon provides severance
benefits to certain employees, including all of the named executive officers other than the CEO, under the Senior Manager Severance Plan.
Under the plan, a named executive officer is eligible to receive severance benefits if he or she experiences a “qualifying separation”
from Verizon, which is generally defined as an involuntary termination by Verizon without cause, a voluntary termination by the executive
solely due to the executive’s refusal to accept a qualifying reclassification or relocation (as those terms are defined in the plan)
or a determination by the independent members of the Board that the named executive officer has incurred a qualifying separation. A severance
benefit, if triggered, is payable to an executive only if the executive executes a release of claims against Verizon in the form satisfactory
to Verizon and agrees not to compete or interfere with any Verizon business for a period of one year after termination from employment
and always to protect Verizon’s trade secrets and proprietary information. If a named executive officer incurs a qualifying separation under the
plan, he or she is eligible to receive the following benefits: (i) a lump-sum cash separation payment equal to two times the
sum of his or her base salary and target Short-Term Plan award opportunity; and (ii) continued medical, dental and vision coverage
for two years. In addition, if the executive’s qualifying separation occurs prior
to the last day of the year, the executive will receive a prorated Short-Term Plan award for the year in which the separation occurs,
determined based on the actual level of achievement of the performance criteria under the Short-Term Plan for the applicable year and
payable at the time that awards are payable to participating employees generally under the plan. To the extent that an executive also
becomes eligible for severance benefits under any outstanding agreement, plan or any other arrangement, the executive’s cash severance
payment under the Senior Manager Severance Plan will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of the severance benefits payable
to the executive under such other agreement, plan or arrangement. Other benefits. Upon an involuntary termination of employment
without cause, a named executive officer would also be eligible to receive financial planning and outplacement services for one year following
termination on the same basis as provided to other senior executives. However, executives would only be entitled to receive financial
planning services if they participate in the program in the year in which their employment terminates. In addition, under the terms of
the executive life insurance plan, each named executive officer who is retirement eligible upon termination and who continues to pay the
annual premiums on the life insurance policy owned by the executive would be eligible to receive an annual cash payment from Verizon to
defray a portion of the annual premiums until the latest of the executive’s attainment of age 60 or the completion of 5 years of
plan participation. Retirement eligibility is generally defined as having attained 75 points (age plus years of service) with at
least 15 years of service, having attained age 65 and 5 years of service or having attained age 55 and 10 years of service. If the named
executive officer is not retirement eligible upon termination and has not reached plan maturity (age 60 and 5 years of plan participation)
upon termination, the executive would be eligible to receive one additional annual cash payment to defray a portion of the annual premiums
for the two years following the year in which the executive’s termination occurs. If the named executive officer is retirement eligible
upon termination and has achieved plan maturity upon his or her termination, the executive would not be entitled to any additional cash
payment from Verizon. 48 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Estimated payments. The following table shows Verizon’s
estimate of the amount of benefits the named executive officers would have been entitled to receive had their employment been involuntarily
terminated without cause on the last business day of 2023 or had they incurred a qualifying separation under the Senior Manager Severance
Plan.

annual premium for the two years following the year in which his termination occurs. The amounts for Messrs. Skiadas, Malady and
Silliman, who are retirement eligible, reflects the value of the future annual cash payments from Verizon used to defray a portion of
the annual premiums until their attainment of age 60. Potential payments upon death, disability or retirement Under the terms of the executive life insurance plan, in the event of
disability or a qualifying retirement, a named executive officer who continues to pay the annual premiums on the life insurance policy
owned by the executive would be eligible to receive an annual payment from Verizon to defray a portion of the annual premium until the
latest of the executive’s attainment of age 60 or the completion of 5 years of plan participation. If the named executive officer
dies, his or her beneficiary would be entitled to receive the proceeds of the life insurance policy owned by the executive, payable by
the third-party issuer of the policy. Under the Short-Term Plan, if the named executive officer’s employment
terminates due to death, disability or a qualifying retirement prior to the last day of the year, the executive would be eligible for
a prorated Short-Term Plan award for the year in which the termination date occurred, determined based on the actual level of achievement
of the performance criteria under the Short-Term Plan for the applicable year and payable at the time that awards are generally payable
to participating employees under the plan. As described above, if the executive’s employment terminates on the last day of the year
for any reason other than for cause, the full amount of the Short-Term Plan award, determined based on the actual level of achievement
of the performance criteria under the Short-Term Plan for the applicable year, would have been payable. In addition, upon death, disability or a qualifying retirement, each
named executive officer would also be eligible to receive financial planning services for one year following termination on the same basis
as provided to other senior executives, provided that the executive participated in the program in the year in which his or her employment
terminates. Upon disability, the named executive officers would also be eligible for disability benefits under the tax-qualified and nonqualified
disability plans. 49 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Estimated payments. The following table shows Verizon’s
estimate of the amount of benefits the named executive officers would have been entitled to receive had their employment terminated due
to death, disability or qualifying retirement on the last business day of 2023.

by the third-party issuer of the policy. In the event of disability or retirement, the amount, if any, represents the total amount of
annual cash payments to the named executive officer to defray a portion of the annual premium of the life insurance policy owned by him
or her, provided that the named executive officer continues to pay the annual premiums pursuant to the terms of the executive life insurance
program. 2 Assumes that each named executive officer would be immediately eligible for long-term disability benefits from Verizon’s qualified
and nonqualified disability benefit plans. The assumptions used to calculate the value of the disability benefits include a discount rate
of 5.12% and mortality and recovery based on the 2012 Group Long-Term Disability Valuation Table. These rates represent the probability
of death or recovery between the date of disability and the payment end date. The qualified portion of the disability benefit for Messrs.
Vestberg, Skiadas, Sampath, Malady and Silliman, is estimated at $769,980, $615,099, $735,336, $569,765 and $581,180, respectively, and
the nonqualified portion of the disability benefit for Messrs. Vestberg, Skiadas, Sampath, Malady and Silliman, is estimated at $699,908,
$885,681, $1,061,010, $819,909 and $836,334, respectively. In order to receive the nonqualified portion of the disability benefit, the
executive must pay the premium associated with the qualified portion of the benefit. 3 Messrs. Vestberg and Sampath would not have been entitled to receive executive life insurance benefits or financial planning benefits
because they had not fulfilled the eligibility requirements for retirement under the terms of those programs on the last business day
of 2023. 50 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Potential payments upon change in control Verizon does not maintain any plans or arrangements that provide for
any named executive officer to receive cash severance or any other cash payments in connection with a change in control of Verizon. If
the named executive officer’s employment terminates in connection with or following a change in control, he or she would be eligible
for the same benefits, if any, that would become payable to the executive upon his or her termination under the circumstances as described
above. Under the Short-Term Plan, if a change in control occurs, all outstanding awards will vest and become payable on the regularly
scheduled payment date. Treatment of equity awards As is the case for all participants under the terms of the Long-Term
Plan and the applicable award agreements, upon death, disability or qualifying retirement, each named executive officer’s then unvested
RSUs will vest and be payable on the regularly scheduled payment dates and each named executive officer’s then unvested PSUs will
vest and be payable on the regularly scheduled payment date after the end of the applicable award cycle, but only if and to the extent
that the applicable performance criteria for the award are achieved at the end of the applicable award cycle. A qualifying retirement
for purposes of the Long-Term Plan generally means to retire after having attained at least 15 years of vesting service (as defined under
the applicable Verizon tax-qualified savings plan) and a combination of age and years of vesting service that equals or exceeds 75, 65
years of age and 5 years of vesting service, or starting with the 2022 awards, 55 years of age and 10 years of vesting service. Commencing
with the 2022 awards, participants, including named executive officers, who voluntarily retire having attained age 55 and 5 years of service
but do not meet the eligibility requirements for a qualifying retirement (referred to as an early retirement) will vest in a prorated
portion of the number of RSUs and PSUs awarded (and accrued dividends) based on the number of days worked during the performance period,
and the remainder of the RSUs and PSUs will be forfeited. Any such prorated portion of the PSUs (and accrued dividends) will be payable
only if and to the extent that the applicable performance criteria for the award are achieved at the end of the applicable award cycle,
and will be payable on the regularly scheduled payment date after the end of the applicable award cycle. As of December 31, 2023,
Messrs. Skiadas, Malady and Silliman were eligible for a qualifying retirement under the Long-Term Plan, Mr. Vestberg was eligible
for early retirement vesting under the terms of his 2022 and 2023 PSU and RSU awards, and Mr. Sampath was not eligible for a qualifying
retirement or early retirement under the Long-Term Plan. If a named executive officer’s employment is involuntarily terminated
by the Company without cause, the named executive officer’s then unvested RSUs and PSUs will vest only as to a prorated portion
of the number of RSUs and PSUs awarded (and accrued dividends) based on the number of days worked during the performance period, and the
remainder of the RSUs and PSUs will be forfeited. Any such prorated portion of the PSUs (and accrued dividends) will be payable only if
and to the extent that the applicable performance criteria for the award are achieved at the end of the applicable award cycle, and will
be payable on the regularly scheduled payment date after the end of the applicable award cycle. With respect to the 2022 special retention
RSU award to Mr. Silliman, if the named executive officer’s employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company without cause,
 Mr. Silliman’s then unvested RSUs will vest and be payable on the regularly scheduled payment date. 51 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information The payment of PSU and RSU awards under the Long-Term Plan following
an involuntary termination of employment without cause, death, disability or qualifying or early retirement is conditioned on the participant
executing a release of claims against Verizon in the form satisfactory to Verizon. The grant of each award is conditioned on the participant’s
agreement to certain restrictive covenants including an agreement not to compete or interfere with any Verizon business for a period of
one year after termination from employment (two years for the CEO), and to always protect Verizon’s trade secrets and proprietary
information. In addition, under the terms of the Long-Term Plan and the applicable
award agreements, if, in the 12 months following a change in control of Verizon, a participant’s employment is involuntarily terminated
without cause, all then-unvested RSUs will vest and be payable on the regularly scheduled payment dates and all then-unvested PSUs will
vest at target level performance and be payable on the regularly scheduled payment date after the end of the applicable award cycle. Under the Long-Term Plan, a change in control of Verizon is generally
defined as the occurrence of any of the following: • Any person becomes a beneficial owner of shares representing twenty percent or more of Verizon’s outstanding voting stock; • Verizon consummates a merger, consolidation, reorganization or any other business combination; or • The Board adopts resolutions authorizing the liquidation or dissolution, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets, of Verizon. However, a change in control will not occur if: • The amount of Verizon voting stock outstanding immediately before the transaction represents at least forty-five percent of the combined
voting power of the corporation that survives the transaction; • Verizon Directors constitute at least one-half of the board of directors of the surviving corporation; • Verizon’s CEO is the CEO of the surviving corporation; and • The headquarters of the surviving corporation is located in New York, New York. Estimated payments. The following table shows the estimated
value of the awards that the named executive officers could have received in respect of their outstanding unvested equity awards if any
of the following events occurred on the last business day of 2023: (i) a change in control of Verizon without a termination of employment;
(ii) a change in control of Verizon and an involuntary termination of employment without cause within 12 months; (iii) a termination
of employment as a result of an involuntary termination without cause (other than in connection with a change in control); (iv) a qualifying
retirement; or (v) death or disability. The occurrence of the foregoing events, other than a change in control of Verizon without
a termination of employment, would trigger accelerated vesting of all or a prorated portion of the awards. The amounts represent the estimated
value of the outstanding RSU and PSU awards granted in 2021, 2022 and 2023, and the 2022 special retention RSU award granted to Mr. Silliman,
calculated using the total number of units (including accrued dividends) on the last business day of 2023 and $37.70, Verizon’s
closing stock price on that date, and for the PSUs, assuming the award would vest at target performance levels. The actual amount payable
under these awards can be determined only at the time the awards would be paid.

awards and 2021, 2022 and 2023 RSU awards based on the number of days worked from the applicable grant date through the assumed termination
date on the last business day of 2023. The amounts in this column for Messrs. Skiadas, Malady and Silliman, reflect the vesting of their
outstanding PSU and RSU awards because they had attained eligibility for a qualifying retirement as of December 31, 2023. 2 Mr. Sampath would not have been entitled to receive any amount in respect of his outstanding unvested equity awards upon retirement
because he had not met the eligibility requirements for retirement or early retirement under the terms of the Long-Term Plan on the last
business day of 2023. Messrs. Skiadas, Malady and Silliman had attained eligibility for a qualifying retirement as of December 31,
2023 for purposes of their outstanding PSUs and RSUs (other than the 2022 special retention RSU award to Mr. Silliman which does
not provide for vesting upon retirement). Mr. Vestberg had attained eligibility for early retirement only with respect to his 2022
and 2023 PSU and RSU awards which would provide him with a prorated portion of the 2022 and 2023 PSU and RSU awards if he had voluntarily
separated from the company on December 31, 2023. 52 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Separation of Mr. Ellis In connection with Mr. Ellis’s involuntary separation from
service from the Company without cause on April 29, 2023, he became entitled to separation benefits under the terms and conditions of
the Senior Manager Severance Plan. The following table sets forth the estimated payments and benefits Mr. Ellis became entitled to
receive upon his separation from Verizon.

value of his outstanding 2022 and 2023 annual RSU and PSU awards. Mr. Ellis’s awards were prorated since he had not attained retirement
eligibility for purposes of his outstanding Long-Term Plan awards on his separation date. For the 2021 PSU award, the value represents
the number of shares acquired on vesting of his 2021 annual PSU award multiplied by $37.70, the closing price of Verizon’s common
stock on December 29, 2023, as reported in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table on page 45.
The value of the 2021 RSU award and the 2022 and 2023 RSU and PSU awards were calculated using the total number of units (including accrued
dividends) on the last business day of 2023 and $37.70, Verizon’s closing stock price on that date, and, in the case of the PSUs,
assuming the awards would vest at target performance. These awards will be paid on the regularly scheduled payment date following the
applicable vesting date based on the stock price on the applicable vesting date, and in the case of the PSUs only if and to the extent
that the applicable performance criteria have been satisfied. 3 Represents one additional payment to defray a portion of the annual premium for one year following Mr. Ellis’s separation from

    dividing (i) the sum of (a) the cumulative amount of dividends for the measurement period, assuming dividend reinvestment,
    and (b) the difference between the Company’s share price at the end and the beginning of the measurement period, by
    (ii) the Company’s share price at the beginning of the measurement period. 6 Represents the weighted peer group TSR, weighted according to the respective
    companies’ stock market capitalization at the beginning of each period for which a return is indicated. The peer group
    used for this purpose is the S&P 500 Telecommunications Services Index, which is the peer group used in the Company’s
    2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for purposes of the stock performance graph pursuant to Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K. 7 The amounts reported represent the amount of net income reflected in the
    Company’s audited financial statements for the applicable year. 8 Adjusted EPS  is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported
    EPS the effect of special items. A reconciliation of adjusted EPS to reported EPS may be found in Appendix B. Pay versus performance relationship discussion As described in greater detail in the Compensation Discussion
and Analysis beginning on page 26, Verizon’s executive compensation program reflects a pay-for-performance
philosophy, with approximately 90% of named executive officers’ total compensation opportunity in the form of variable, incentive-based
pay. The metrics we use for both our long-term and short-term incentive awards are selected based on an objective to pay for superior
results and sustainable growth by rewarding the achievement of challenging short- and long-term performance goals designed to build
shareholder value and drive performance. While Verizon utilizes several performance measures to align executive compensation with
Company performance, all of those Company measures are not presented in the Pay versus Performance table. The following charts illustrate the relationship between the “Compensation
Actually Paid” and the financial performance measures set forth in the Pay versus Performance table above: TSR, peer group
TSR, net income and adjusted EPS, which is the measure the Company identified as the most important performance measure (that is
not otherwise required to be disclosed in the table) used by the Company to link “Compensation Actually Paid” to the
Company’s named executive officers, for the most recently completed fiscal year, to Company performance. The Company selected
adjusted EPS, which is a performance metric under our Long-Term Plan (subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the
awards), because it is a performance metric under each of the annual Long-Term Plan awards that impacts the 2023 “Compensation
Actually Paid”, and the Company’s adjusted EPS has an impact on the Company’s stock price and relative TSR, which
also affect the value of those awards. We believe the “Compensation Actually Paid” in each
of the years reported above and over the four-year cumulative period are reflective of the Committee’s emphasis on “pay-for-performance”
as the “Compensation Actually Paid” fluctuated year-over-year, primarily due to the result of our stock performance
and our varying levels of achievement against pre-established performance goals under our short-term and long-term plans. 56 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information 57 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information For 2023, the most important financial performance measures we
used to link executive “Compensation Actually Paid” to the named executive officers to Verizon’s performance
are as follows, which are described in more detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and are the performance metrics
the Committee chose for Company’s 2023 Long-Term Plan and Short-Term Plan: • Adjusted EPS • Service and other revenue • Free cash flow • Relative TSR • Adjusted operating income • Cash flow from operations CEO pay ratio disclosure Pursuant to SEC rules, we are required to disclose in this proxy
statement the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees
(excluding the CEO). We determined that the annualized total compensation of Mr. Vestberg was $24,152,824, the median of the 2023
annual total compensation of all of our employees (excluding Mr. Vestberg) was $167,334, and the ratio of these amounts was 144
to 1. For purposes of calculating the ratio, the value of employer provided benefits under non-discriminatory health plans was
included in the compensation of each of Mr. Vestberg and the median employee. As required by SEC rules, the calculation of annual total compensation
for both the CEO and the median employee includes a change in pension value during the year. The change in pension value is subject
to several external variables, including interest rates that are not related to company or individual performance and may differ
significantly based on the formula under which the benefits were earned. The change in pension value for the median employee was
$23,836 during the year. Because Mr. Vestberg does not have a pension benefit, we note that if we eliminated the change in pension
value from our median employee’s 2023 annual total compensation, the median employee’s annual total compensation would
have been $143,498 and our CEO to median employee pay ratio would have been 168 to 1. We identified our median employee using the methodology described
below. There has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements since the median employee was
identified that we believe would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure. However, our original median employee identified
for the 2022 pay ratio disclosure is no longer employed by the Company. Accordingly, as permitted under SEC rules, for purposes
of our 2024 pay ratio disclosure we have substituted a new median employee with substantially similar compensation as the original
median employee based on the compensation measure used to select the original median employee in 2022. The median employee for
our 2024 pay ratio is located in the New York region of the United States. To identify the “median employee” for purposes
of the 2022 pay ratio disclosure (i.e., the individual employee whose compensation was at the median level among our entire employee
group), we used a determination date of October 1, 2021 and analyzed, for all of the individuals employed by us or any of our consolidated
subsidiaries on that date, the compensation that we paid to each of those individuals for the 12-month period ending on that date.
We considered each employee’s “compensation” to consist of (i) the employee’s total gross earnings for
the 12-month period ending October 1, 2021, plus (ii) the estimated amount of Verizon’s contributions for that period to
the retirement plans in which the employee participates, plus (iii) the estimated present value of the employee’s accrual
under a Verizon pension plan (if any) for those who are still accruing service and whose benefits have not otherwise been frozen.
The compensation for employees, other than temporary and seasonal employees, who were not employed by us for the entire 12-month
period was annualized to reflect compensation for the entire 12-month period. 58 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Audit matters Item 3: Ratification of appointment of independent registered
public accounting firm The Audit Committee considered the performance and qualifications
of Ernst & Young, and has reappointed the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the financial statements of
Verizon for fiscal year 2024 and to audit the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young has
been retained as Verizon’s independent registered public accounting firm since 2000. Verizon paid the following fees to Ernst & Young for services
rendered during fiscal years 2023 and 2022. Audit fees Audit- related fees Tax fees All other fees 2023 $34.5 million $8.4 million $3.4 million – 2022 $37.1 million $8.8 million $4.4 million – Audit fees are attributable to services that include the financial
statement audit, the audit of the effectiveness of Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, financial statement audits required by statute for our foreign subsidiaries, and procedures in connection with
securities offerings and SEC filings. Audit-related fees are attributable to services that primarily include audits of other
subsidiaries, reviews of controls over services provided to customers, work related to the implementation of new accounting
standards, and attestation procedures with respect to sustainability reporting, as well as other audits and due diligence procedures
performed in connection with acquisitions, dispositions or other financial transactions. Tax fees are attributable to services that
primarily consist of federal, state, local and international tax planning and compliance. The Audit Committee considered, in
consultation with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, whether Ernst & Young could provide these
services while maintaining independence. The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment,
compensation, retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm that performs audit services. In considering
Ernst & Young’s appointment for the 2024 fiscal year, the Committee reviewed the firm’s independence, qualifications
and competencies, including the following factors: • Ernst & Young’s historical performance and its recent performance during its engagement for
    the 2023 fiscal year, including with respect to key audit quality indicators, such as the continuity of the engagement team,
    the use by Ernst & Young of specialists, and Ernst & Young’s tenure in the industry; • Ernst & Young’s capability and expertise in handling the breadth and complexity of Verizon’s operations; • the qualifications and experience of key members of the engagement team, including the lead engagement partner, for the
    audit of Verizon’s financial statements; • the quality of Ernst & Young’s communications with the Committee regarding the conduct of the audit, and with
    management with respect to issues identified in the audit; • external data on audit quality and performance of, including recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)
    reports on, Ernst & Young; • the appropriateness of Ernst & Young’s fees for audit and non-audit services, on both an absolute
    basis and as compared to its peer firms; and • Ernst & Young’s reputation for integrity and competence in the fields of accounting and auditing. In addition, in order to facilitate continuing auditor independence,
the Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent registered public accounting
firm. The Committee oversees the routine, mandated rotation of Ernst & Young’s personnel and is directly involved in
the selection of Ernst & Young’s lead engagement partner. 59 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information The Committee has established policies and procedures regarding
pre-approval of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and is responsible for negotiating the audit
fees associated with the engagement. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the Committee pre-approves the engagement of the independent
registered public accounting firm to provide audit services based on fee estimates. The Committee also pre-approves proposed audit-related
services, tax services and other permissible services based on specified project and service details, fee estimates and aggregate
fee limits. The Committee receives a report at each meeting on the status of services provided or to be provided by the independent
registered public accounting firm and approves the related fees. The Committee pre-approved all of Ernst & Young’s 2023
fees and services. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares cast at the annual
meeting is required to ratify the reappointment of Ernst & Young for the 2024 fiscal year. The Committee believes that continuing
to retain Ernst & Young to serve as Verizon’s independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests
of Verizon and our shareholders. If this appointment is not ratified by the shareholders, the Committee will reconsider its decision.
One or more representatives of Ernst & Young will join the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. They will have an opportunity
to make a statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. The Board of Directors recommends that you
    vote FOR ratification. 60 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Audit Committee Report In the performance of our oversight responsibilities, the Audit
Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the independent registered public accounting firm Verizon’s audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the effectiveness of Verizon’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2023. The Committee has discussed with the independent registered public
accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the SEC, the NYSE, Nasdaq, and PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications
with Audit Committees . The Committee has received written disclosures and a letter from
the independent registered public accounting firm consistent with applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requirements
for independent registered public accounting firm communications with audit committees concerning independence, and has discussed
with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence. The Committee discussed with the internal auditors and the independent
registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Committee met with the internal
auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of
their examinations, their evaluations of Verizon’s internal controls, and the overall quality of Verizon’s financial
reporting. The Committee has assessed and discussed with management Verizon’s
significant business risk exposures and overseen management’s programs and policies to monitor, assess and manage such exposures.
The Committee also periodically monitored and evaluated the primary risks associated with particular business units and functions. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, in reliance
on management and the independent registered public accounting firm, and subject to the limitations of our role, the Committee
recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, the inclusion of the financial statements referred to above
in Verizon’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Committee reviewed the independent registered public accounting
firm’s performance, qualifications and tenure, the qualifications of the lead engagement partner, management’s recommendation
regarding retention of the firm, and considerations related to audit firm rotation, as discussed further on page 59. Based on that
review, the Committee reappointed the independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2024.

        levels shown to the right, in order to align their interests with those of our shareholders. Executive officers, including the CEO, are required to attain these stock ownership levels within
        five years of assuming their leadership roles, and Directors are required to do so within four years of joining the Board. To determine whether a Director or executive officer meets the required share ownership level,
        shares of common stock held directly, through a broker, or in the Verizon tax-qualified savings plan or non-qualified

common stock, proposes the following: Cease Political Contributions Study Whereas: Former chief justice of the Delaware
Supreme Court Leo Strine argued in the Harvard Business Review: “Because political donations are controlled by managers,
and because no corporate stakeholders, including shareholders, base their relationship with a company on the expectation that
it will use its entrusted capital for political purposes, corporate political spending cannot reflect the diverse preferences
and views of those stakeholders. Even the classic justification that corporate donations maximize shareholder wealth is
on shaky ground: Emerging evidence suggests that they can destroy value by suppressing innovation and distracting managers from
more-pressing tasks.” https://hbr.org/2022/01/corporate-political-spending-is-bad-business For example, a study of corporate political activity in the form
of lobbying and PAC spending by S&P 500 companies from 1998 to 2004 found that it was strongly and negatively related to company
value. This suggests that ceasing political spending does not necessarily put a company at a competitive disadvantage. https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/30064396/Coates_684.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Furthermore, political contributions by one company can take
the form of rent-seeking which may lead to externalities that weigh on other companies, taxpayers, and consumers – possibly
slowing real overall economic growth. This may raise concerns for widely diversified investors who are more exposed to the prosperity
of the broader economy and suggests that they should support a cessation of political contributions. Increasingly, companies such as IBM, Nvidia, ADP, Boeing, Verisign,
and fifteen others are adopting policies prohibiting contributions of political funds directly or indirectly to influence elections.
And another 72 companies prohibited or restricted payments to either trade associations or 501(c)(4)s. https://www.politicalaccountability.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-CPA-Zicklin-Index.pdf We believe Verizon has reputational risk as it has repeatedly
been called out for political contributions which appear to be inconsistent with its corporate values. As was pointed out in 2022,
Verizon recognized Women’s History Month by highlighting how “Verizon ‘focus[es] on breaking down bias and stereotypes
while continuing progress on women’s equality and gender equality.’” But between 2016 and May 2022, Verizon
reportedly contributed $901,150 to anti-abortion political committees. https://popular.info/p/these-13-corporations-have-spent Verizon claims it is “proud to foster an inclusive environment”
and that it is “committed to LGBTQ+ equality across the board.” From January 2022 through May 2023 Verizon reportedly
contributed $385,000 to anti-LGBTQ politicians. https://popular.info/p/these-25-major-corporations-donated We believe that business needs a healthy democracy, yet it appears
that “Verizon has donated $123,000 to 54 different GOP election deniers.” https://gizmodo.com/amazon-election-deniers-2020-midterms-pacs-1849706425 Given potential risks and potential negative impact on shareholder
or portfolio value, the proponents believe Verizon should study a policy to refrain from using corporate treasury funds in the
political process. 64 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Resolved : The shareholders request that the board (at
reasonable cost, within a reasonab le time, and excluding confidential/proprietary information) commission,
oversee, and publish an independent third-party study which examines the impact on the company, the sector, and American democracy
of the company adopting a policy prohibiting the use of corporate or PAC funds for direct or indirect contributions to political
candidates. The study should provide recommendations and potential next steps. The Board of Directors
        recommends that you vote AGAINST this
        proposal for the following reasons: Verizon is committed to responsible engagement in the
        political process. Political contributions are a critical aspect of Verizon’s advocacy for its business interests
        and support for the democratic electoral process. To ensure responsible engagement in political contributions, Verizon
        has put in place strong governance processes, including Board oversight and transparency practices, that enable us to
        align our political contributions with our business strategy and policy priorities and to mitigate reputational risk.
        A prohibition on political giving would place Verizon at a significant competitive disadvantage when advocating for our
        business interests relative to other companies, and especially relative to peers in our highly regulated industry. As
        a result, the Board believes that a third-party study on a policy prohibiting political and electioneering expenditures
        would not provide valuable information and would be contrary to shareholders’ interests. The importance of political
        engagement. Verizon is affected by a wide variety of government policies that significantly impact our business.
        Given the highly regulated, highly competitive nature of our industry, it is crucial that Verizon participates actively
        in the political process. Our Political Engagement Report ( https://www.verizon.com/about/investors/political-contributions-report-archive )
        sets out our public policy priorities, which are mission-critical to our business and include maintaining the United States’
        leadership in 5G, ensuring access to licensed spectrum, and the affordability of and access to broadband services that
        will help narrow or eliminate the digital divide. Other companies, including Verizon’s competitors, often have opposing
        views on these critical policy issues, and some of those companies are among the most active political contributors in
        this space. Removing Verizon from the process completely would put us at a significant competitive disadvantage. Political contributions. We maintain a strong
        reputation for responsible political spending, and we rank in the first tier of companies in the CPA-Zicklin Index of
        Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability. Verizon makes corporate political contributions where the law permits,
        and Verizon operates several political action committees (PACs) that support candidates at the federal, state and local
        levels who make decisions on policy issues that impact Verizon. We make contributions to candidates for political office
        and to organizations that support candidates for office and ballot initiatives. We do not make corporate political contributions
        or PAC contributions to presidential candidates or federal Super PACs. Verizon makes every effort to align our political contributions,
        corporate purpose and overall business strategy, and organizational values. Bipartisan political giving is foundational
        to our political engagement strategy. We support candidates of any political party who share our priorities, even if we
        do not agree with them on every issue. The criteria we use to inform our decision whether to support a particular
        candidate are wide-ranging and include general alignment with our business objectives, a candidate’s committee assignments
        and committee standing and ranking, their leadership position and track record on strategic business and policy issues
        for Verizon, and whether a candidate’s stated views or voting records advance our corporate purpose and organizational
        values. To mitigate reputational risk, we review whether a candidate has made public statements on sensitive public policy
        issues that have resulted in controversy, and the nature and impact of any such statement. 65 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information We recognize that we will not always agree with every
        stated position of every candidate or organization that we contribute to and that every candidate or organization will
        not always reflect all of Verizon’s beliefs or priorities. When Verizon makes decisions on political support, we
        consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether support is, on balance, in the best interest
        of Verizon, our shareholders, employees and customers. These decisions are multifaceted and at times can be complex, always
        requiring oversight and governance. Governance and oversight. The Corporate Governance
        and Policy Committee oversees Verizon’s participation in the political process including political giving, memberships
        and trade associations and reputational risk. The Committee receives a comprehensive report and briefing on our political
        activities at least annually. All of Verizon’s political activity is subject to the Company’s Code of Conduct
        and other corporate policies, and is directly overseen by the Senior Vice President of Public Policy and Government Affairs.
        The Legal Department reviews all corporate political contributions to ensure consistency with the Company’s policy
        and strategy and compliance with the law, and senior leaders in the Public Policy and Government Affairs organization
        approve all PAC contributions. Members of Verizon’s PAC boards evaluate and approve the PAC budget and our giving
        to candidates to ensure that contributions to each candidate meet the criteria described above. Transparency. Verizon is committed to transparency
        regarding our political engagement activities, including political contributions. Twice a year, Verizon publishes our
        Political Engagement Report, which includes information about our policy priorities, governance and oversight, and all
        of our corporate political contributions and PAC contributions. Additionally, in accordance with applicable laws, Verizon’s
        PACs file public reporting with the Federal Election Commission and state and local campaign finance regulators. We aim to be responsive to feedback from our shareholders
        on how we can enhance transparency related to our political engagement efforts. By our 2024 mid-year Political Engagement
        Report, we will revise the information we provide on significant memberships and will disclose an estimate of the amount
        of Verizon’s payments used for lobbying activities. A prohibition on political contributions would place
        Verizon at a competitive disadvantage. Verizon has a strong reputation for responsible political spending and transparency,
        and a rigorous process in place to govern and oversee responsible political contributions that align with our business
        strategy and policy priorities. Accordingly, the Board believes that a third-party study on the prohibition of political
        and electioneering expenditures is not in the best interest of our shareholders. Item 5: Lobbying activities report Alyson Pytte, owner of 97 shares of Verizon’s common stock,
and a co-sponsor propose the following: Resolved, shareholders of Verizon request the preparation
of a report, updated annually, disclosing: 1. Company policy and procedures
    governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications. 2. Payments by Verizon used for (a) direct or
    indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient. 3. Verizon’s membership in and payments
    to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation. 4. Description of management’s decision-making
    process and the Board’s oversight for making payments described in sections 2 and 3 above. For purposes of this proposal, a “grassroots lobbying communication”
is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on
the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation
or regulation. “Indirect lobbying” is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Verizon
is a member. Both “direct and indirect lobbying” and “grassroots lobbying communications” include efforts
at the local, state and federal levels. 66 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information The report shall be presented to the Corporate Governance and
Policy Committee and posted on Verizon’s website. Supporting Statement Full disclosure of Verizon’s lobbying activities and expenditures
is needed to assess whether Verizon’s lobbying is consistent with its expressed goals and shareholder interests. Verizon
spent $166,939,249 from 2010 – 2022 on federal lobbying. This does not include state lobbying expenditures, where Verizon
also lobbies extensively, for example spending $12 million on lobbying in California from 2010 – 2022. And Verizon lobbies
abroad, spending between €400,000 – 499,999 on lobbying in Europe for 2022. Companies can give unlimited amounts to third party groups that spend
millions on lobbying and undisclosed grassroots activity. 1 Verizon fails to disclose its payments to trade associations and
social welfare groups (SWGs), or the amounts used for lobbying, to shareholders. Verizon belongs to the Business Roundtable, CTIA –
the Wireless Association, National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and USTelecom – the Broadband Association, which together
spent $47,460,000 on federal lobbying in 2022, and supports SWGs that lobby like Americans for Tax Reform and the RATE Coalition. Verizon’s lack of disclosure presents reputational risks when
its lobbying contradicts company public positions. For example, Verizon publicly supports addressing climate change, yet the BRT lobbied
against the Inflation Reduction Act 2 and NAM leverages its “influence to obstruct climate policy progress in the
U.S. at the federal, state and local levels.” 3 As Verizon has drawn scrutiny for paying single digits in federal
taxes for 2018 - 2022, 4 the RATE Coalition lobbied against raising taxes to pay for health care, education and safety
net programs. 5 And while Verizon no longer belongs to the controversial American Legislative Exchange Council, 6 it
was still represented by NAM, which previously sat on its Private Enterprise Advisory Council. 7 Verizon should expand its lobbying disclosure. 1 https://theintercept.com/2019/08/06/business-group-spending-on-lobbying-in-washington-is-at-least-double- whats-publicly-reported/ . 2 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/top-us-business-lobby-group-climate-action-business-roundtable. 3 https://www.greenbiz.com/article/dont-play-both-sides-take-3-steps-now-fix-your-trade-group-gap. 4 https://itep.org/corporations-reap-billions-in-tax-breaks-under-bonus-depreciation/ . 5 https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/31/business-lobbying-democrats-reconciliation/. 6 https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/09/verizon-quits-alec-david-horowitz/. 7 https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2023/02/03/alec-expands-private-board-of-directors-with-woke-capitalism-fighters/. The Board of Directors
        recommends that you vote AGAINST this
        proposal for the following reasons: Verizon is committed to responsible engagement in the
        political process, and we maintain a strong reputation for responsible political spending with a ranking in the first
        tier of companies in the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability. We provide shareholders
        with information on lobbying activity and memberships in third-party organizations (including trade associations and 501(c)(4)s)
        in our Political Engagement Report, and intend to revise the information we provide on significant memberships by our
        2024 mid-year report and will disclose an estimate of the amount of Verizon’s payments used for lobbying activities.
        The Board believes that the additional report requested by the proponent, containing much of the same information we already
        disclose or plan to disclose, would not provide value to shareholders. The importance of political
        engagement. Verizon is affected by a wide variety of government policies that significantly impact our business.
        Given the highly regulated, highly competitive nature of our industry, it is crucial that Verizon participates actively
        in the political process. Our Political Engagement Report ( https://www.verizon.com/about/investors/political-contributions-report-archive )
        sets out our public policy priorities, which are mission-critical to our business and include maintaining the United States’
        leadership in 5G, ensuring access to licensed spectrum, and the affordability of and access to broadband services that
        will help narrow or eliminate the digital divide. Other companies, including Verizon’s competitors, often have opposing
        views on these critical policy issues, and some of those companies are among the most active political contributors in
        this space. 67 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Direct and indirect lobbying activities. Verizon
        is affected by a wide variety of government policies that significantly impact our business. We engage in direct lobbying
        (through Verizon’s government affairs employees) and indirect lobbying (through outside consultants) at all levels
        of government to advocate for policy priorities that impact our customers, employees, and shareholders. Verizon strictly
        complies with all lobbying laws. We also make our voice heard through participation in
        trade associations and by supporting advocacy organizations. Verizon supports these organizations for a variety of reasons,
        ranging from our interest in the community, access to industry expertise, or common goals and interests on key strategic
        policy and business issues. We recognize that we may not always agree with every position of each organization or its
        other members, and these groups often have a diversity of members, interests, and viewpoints that may not always reflect
        Verizon’s beliefs or priorities. In order to mitigate reputational risks associated with our engagement with these
        organizations, we regularly review our participation in these organizations to confirm ongoing alignment with our corporate
        priorities and goals. When we disagree with a position of an organization we support, we communicate our concerns through
        the senior executives that interact with these organizations. Governance and oversight. The Corporate Governance
        and Policy Committee oversees Verizon’s participation in the political process including political giving, memberships
        and trade associations and reputational risk. The Committee receives a comprehensive report and briefing on our political
        activities at least annually. All of Verizon’s political activity is subject to the company’s Code of Conduct
        and other corporate policies, and is directly overseen by the Senior Vice President of Public Policy and Government Affairs
        and the Legal Department. Verizon’s Public Policy and Government Affairs organization approves any engagement of
        lobbyists on behalf of Verizon. Corporate policy and training materials provide guidance to employees regarding legal
        requirements in connection with lobbying activities. Transparency. Our
        semi-annual Political Engagement Report ( https://www.verizon.com/about/investors/political-contributions-report-archive ) discusses our policy priorities and lobbying
        activity and links to our federal lobbying disclosures, with information about Verizon’s lobbying activities and
        expenditures. Verizon also files public reports disclosing our lobbying activities with the U.S. Congress and state and
        local lobbying regulatory bodies in accordance with applicable laws. Our Political Engagement Report provides information
        about our Public Policy organization’s significant memberships in trade associations and issue advocacy organizations
        (501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) organizations). We aim to be responsive to feedback from our shareholders
        on how we can enhance transparency related to our lobbying and other political engagement efforts. By our 2024 mid-year
        Political Engagement Report, we will revise the information we provide on significant memberships and will disclose an
        estimate of the amount of Verizon’s payments used for lobbying activities. Verizon has a strong reputation for responsible political
        spending and transparency. In light of our rigorous policies, governance, oversight, and transparency of lobbying activities,
        the Board believes that the additional report requested by the proponent, containing much of the same information we already
        disclose or plan to disclose, would not provide meaningful additional information to shareholders. 68 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Item 6: Amend clawback policy Thomas M. Steed, owner of 280 shares of Verizon’s common
stock, proposes the following: Amend Senior Executive Compensation Clawback Policy RESOLVED: Verizon shareholders urge our Board of
Directors to amend the Company’s Senior Executive Clawback Policy to state that “conduct” – not “willful
misconduct” – may trigger application of that policy, with the Board or its Human Resources Committee to
report to shareholders the results of any deliberations about whether to cancel or seek recoupment of compensation paid, granted
or awarded to a senior executive. These amendments should operate prospectively and be implemented so as not to violate any contract,
compensation plan, law or regulation. SUPPORTING STATEMENT Verizon’s current policy allows the company to cancel or “claw
back” the cash and equity-based compensation of senior executives who engage in “willful misconduct . . . that results
in significant reputational or financial harm to Verizon.” A clawback for conduct other than “willful misconduct,”
including even “gross negligence,” is considered only when it results in a restatement of financial results. Because Verizon’s clawback policy focuses on “willful misconduct”
and does not require disclosure to shareholders, we believe it is too narrow, too vague, and does not address situations where
an executive fails to exercise oversight responsibilities that result in significant financial or reputational damage to Verizon.
It should. A new clawback policy based on “conduct,” not “willful
misconduct,” is consistent with the 2022 rule adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that requires companies
to claw back erroneously awarded incentive compensation based on erroneous financial statements– even when there
is no misconduct. Clawbacks at McDonald’s, CBS, UnitedHealth Group and Wells Fargo
offer prime examples of why Verizon needs a stronger policy. After Congressional hearings in 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185
million to resolve claims of fraudulent sales practices. Wells Fargo concluded the CEO had turned a blind eye to the practice
of opening fraudulent accounts without customer consent. Wells Fargo’s board then clawed back $136 million from two top executives
based on a policy of the sort we propose here. Like Wells Fargo, Verizon is a consumer-facing company with significant
exposure to reputational and financial harm from large fines or liability for conduct alleged to violate federal or state laws. Verizon’s record underscores the need for a stronger policy.
For example, in 2020 the Federal Communications Commission proposed a $48.3 million fine against Verizon for selling customer
location data without consent. In 2015 Verizon paid $90 million to settle a FCC investigation alleging “cramming,”
which is the unauthorized placement of third-party charges on subscribers’ mobile phone bills. Did Verizon’s board scrutinize the knowledge and actions of the
executives responsible to determine if a clawback was justified? And as a general policy matter, shouldn’t negligence or supervisory
failure that harms the Company warrant a clawback? Incentives influence behavior. We believe stronger incentives
not to take undue risks that may boost short-term profitability are appropriate. The Board of Directors
        recommends that you vote AGAINST this
        proposal for the following reasons: Verizon already has strong clawback policies that the
        Board believes protect the interests of Verizon and its shareholders in two different circumstances: • Reputational or financial harm . Verizon
        has the right to cancel and/or demand reimbursement of cash and equity incentive compensation if the Human Resources Committee
        of the Board determines that an executive engaged in willful misconduct in connection with the performance of his or her
        duties that resulted in significant reputational or financial harm to the Company. 69 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information • Financial restatement . Verizon requires
        the cancellation and/or repayment of an executive’s cash and equity incentive compensation if the Committee determines
        that Verizon was required to materially restate its financial results because of the executive’s willful misconduct
        or gross negligence. In addition, in 2023, Verizon adopted a new clawback
        policy in accordance with the final clawback rules adopted by the SEC and the listing standards of the NYSE and Nasdaq
        (Clawback Rules). This additional clawback policy generally provides for the mandatory recovery of erroneously awarded
        “incentive-based compensation” (as defined in the Clawback Rules) from current and former executive officers
        in the event that Verizon is required to prepare an accounting restatement, without taking into account the executive’s
        personal culpability, in accordance with the Clawback Rules. However, Verizon’s previously existing clawback policies
        described above continue to cover a much wider range of circumstances and compensation. The Board designed Verizon’s clawback policies
        to target and discourage willful wrongdoing by executives, which the Board believes is the purpose of clawback policies.
        The Board believes the proposal is defective because it would allow for a clawback of compensation outside of the context
        of a financial restatement without taking into account an executive’s personal culpability. The Board of Directors
        believes that a clawback policy that does not take into account personal culpability outside of the context of a financial
        restatement is inappropriate because it would potentially allow for a clawback of compensation for legitimate business
        decisions that subsequently come under scrutiny. By seeking to disregard personal culpability in all such circumstances,
        the proposal could discourage senior executives from exercising the business judgment necessary to deliver shareholder
        value. The Board also believes that mandating disclosure of all of its deliberations, regardless of whether the Board
        determines that an executive’s actions ultimately constituted a violation of the clawback polices, is inappropriate
        because it would deprive the Board of the ability to exercise judgment and discretion with respect to the disclosure of
        potentially sensitive information. Item 7: Independent Board chair Kenneth Steiner, owner of at least 500 shares of Verizon’s
common stock, proposes the following: Proposal
    7 - Independent Board Chairman Shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt an enduring
policy, and amend the governing documents as necessary in order that 2 separate people hold the office of the Chairman and the
office of the CEO. Whenever possible, the Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent
Director. The Board has the discretion to select a Temporary Chairman of
the Board who is not an Independent Director to serve while the Board is seeking an Independent Chairman of the Board on an accelerated
basis. Although it is a best practice to adopt this policy soon this
policy could be phased in when there is a contract renewal for our current CEO or for the next CEO transition. The roles of Chairman and CEO are fundamentally different and
should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent of the CEO and Verizon. The job of the CEO is
to manage the company. The job of the Chairman is to oversee the CEO. A Lead Director is no substitute for an independent Board Chairman.
A lead director is not responsible for the strategic direction of the company. And a Chairman/CEO can ignore the advice and feedback
from a lead director. The Verizon lead director has tasks some of which he shares with
others. Weak words describe the tasks of the Verizon lead director. There is a “seek to promote” task and an “act
as liaison” task. There are 2 “be available” tasks. There is an “approve” task for which the lead
director should be involved in the development of what he now only approves after the fact. There is a vague “may call a
meeting” task. The 2023 annual meeting proxy did not disclose the last time the role of the Verizon lead director was updated. 70 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Perhaps there should be a rule against a person who has been
a CEO and a Chairman at the same time elsewhere being named as Verizon lead director. Verizon lead director Mr. Clarence Otis
had 9-years in the dual jobs of Chairman and CEO. Past and present holders of both jobs at the same time would
seem to have a special affinity with the one Verizon person who now has the 2 most important Verizon jobs, Chairman and CEO. Affinity
is inconsistent with the oversight role of a lead director. Plus Mr. Otis has 18-years of long tenure at Verizon. As director
tenure goes up director independence goes down. Independence is the most important attribute in a lead director. Mr. Otis received
the second highest against votes at the 2023 Verizon annual meeting. Now is a good time for a change since Verizon stock was at $61
in December 2019 and had then fallen to $37 in late 2023. Please vote yes: Independent Board Chairman - Proposal
7 The Board of Directors
        recommends that you vote AGAINST this
        proposal for the following reasons: The Board of Directors fundamentally disagrees with the
        proposal’s rigid and prescriptive approach to the important issue of Board leadership. The Board believes that decisions
        concerning its leadership structure, including whether an independent Chairman is appropriate, should be based on the
        unique circumstances and challenges confronting Verizon at any given time, and should take into account the individual
        skills and experience that may be required in an effective Chairman at that time. As a result, the Board regularly reviews
        and assesses the effectiveness of its leadership structure. When conducting its assessment, the Board considers, among
        other things, whether the current structure is appropriate to effectively address the specific business challenges and
        opportunities posed by our industry and the long-term interests of our shareholders. Moreover, the Board continues to believe that because
        its present leadership structure includes a strong independent Lead Director role, this addresses any concerns about the
        Board’s ability to provide objective feedback and guidance. The Lead Director, who is elected by the independent
        Directors, shares governance responsibilities with the Chairman, including approving Board agendas, schedules and materials,
        and has the authority to call Board meetings and executive sessions. The Lead Director also acts as a liaison with the
        Chairman, promotes a strong Board culture, including encouraging and facilitating active participation of all Directors,
        and facilitates effective independent oversight of management’s performance and accountability to shareholders.
        The Lead Director chairs the executive sessions of the Board, including those held to evaluate the CEO’s performance
        and compensation, oversees the process for CEO succession planning along with the Human Resources Committee, and is responsible
        for leading the Board’s annual self-evaluation. The Board also has adopted policies to ensure that the
        independent Directors of the Board are fully involved in the operations of the Board and its decision making. All Directors
        are encouraged to review Board agendas, schedules and materials and provide suggestions in advance of meetings, and all
        have unrestricted access to management. The independent Directors typically meet in executive session at each Board meeting.
        Given the robust corporate governance practices Verizon has put in place to ensure full involvement of all Directors and
        facilitate communication and independent oversight, the Board believes that shareholders are best served by allowing it
        to retain the flexibility to determine which Director is most qualified to lead the Board at any given time. The Board understands that leadership structures evolve
        and that having an independent Chairman could, at some future point, be in the shareholders’ best interest. However,
        the Board believes that eliminating its flexibility to do what is in the best interests of shareholders by instituting
        a general policy that would compel Verizon to have an independent Chairman is unnecessarily rigid and unwise. 71 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Item 8: Civil liberties in digital services American Family Association, owner of 530 shares of Verizon’s
common stock, proposes the following: Respect Civil Liberties in Digital Services Supporting Statement: Digital service providers (DSPs) control access to critical services
and platforms that drive innovation in the American economy and facilitate expression and the open exchange of information across
the globe. These companies have unprecedented power to censor speech. And they are under increasing pressure to remove unpopular
religious and political views from the marketplace. Respecting fundamental freedoms, like free speech and religious
liberty, drives healthy discourse and tolerance for diverse views. Verizon (the “Company”) can and should promote
these freedoms to best serve its diverse users and promote a healthy market and marketplace of ideas. Economic growth also requires
innovation, and that requires the freedom to challenge the status quo. If DSPs stifle such freedom, they will not only lock out
Americans from some of the best tools for innovation and growth, but will hurt their own bottom lines in the process. But recent events and Verizon’s own policies suggest that users’
and customers’ freedom of expression and religion are at risk. The 2023 edition of the Viewpoint Diversity Business Index 1 ,
in which Verizon scored a mere 11%, shows that Verizon’s product/service policies permit the Company to deny or restrict service
based on “unclear or imprecise terms,” creating a further lack of transparency regarding the Company’s actual standards
and practices. In this, what can Verizon shareholders believe? These kinds of terms allow Verizon and the activists and governments
who may pressure them to deny or restrict service for arbitrary or discriminatory reasons. They also allow the Company to avoid accountability
by hiding censorship behind vague and shifting standards. And concerns over censorship are very real. As noted in the 1792 Exchange’s
report, 2 which labeled the Company as High Risk, Verizon attracted criticism during the 2020 presidential campaign over
“cessation of service” regarding the Trump campaign. With no proven cause or good-faith explanation given by the Company,
the possibility of political discrimination remains open. When Verizon engages in this kind of discrimination, they expose
themselves to heightened legal liability and hinder the ability of Americans to access the marketplace. This undermines the fundamental
freedoms of our country and is an affront to the public trust. Verizon also maintains that it promotes diversity and inclusion, 3 and
has maintained the ostensible value of free speech in defending its users’ privacy. 4 Shareholders must know that
Verizon is adhering to its own standards by serving diverse consumers without regard to their beliefs or other factors above. Resolved: Shareholders request the Board of Directors
of Verizon conduct an evaluation and issue a report within the next year, at reasonable cost and excluding proprietary information
and disclosure of anything that would constitute an admission of pending litigation, evaluating how it oversees risks related
to discrimination against users or customers based on their race, color, religion (including religious views), sex, national origin,
or political views, and how such discrimination impacts users, customers, and other individuals’ exercise of their constitutionally
protected civil rights. 1 https://www.viewpointdiversityscore.org/company/verizon-communications 2 https://1792exchange.com/pdf/?c_id=705 3 https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/diversity-and-inclusion 4 https://www.verizon.com/about/news/press-releases/verizon-wins-critical-legal-battle-protect-internet-users-privacy-free-speech-rights-and-personal-safety 72 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information The Board of Directors

        on non-discrimination, including non-discrimination with respect to political or religious views. We provide terms and
        conditions that set out our policies on account suspension and account termination, and our website provides information
        about the requirements applicable to high-volume text messaging, including political text messaging. We do not take political
        or religious views into account in decision-making in these areas. We believe that the report requested by the proponent
        would not provide any meaningful additional information to shareholders on these topics. Non-discrimination policies. Verizon is committed
        to serving our diverse customer base, and we do not discriminate against customers based on religious or political views.
        Our policies, including our Code of Conduct, set out our commitment to non-discrimination and to treating customers with
        fairness and respect. All Verizon employees receive mandatory training on the Code of Conduct at their time of hire and
        its provisions are continually reinforced through annual training and periodic communications. Where an individual has
        a concern related to discrimination, a violation of our Code of Conduct, or other ethics matters, Verizon Ethics provides
        a confidential, 24/7 ethics hotline and an online web portal for anyone who wants to report such concerns. Verizon thoroughly
        investigates all claims of misconduct. Account suspension and
        termination. Our “guiding principles for content” ( https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/company-policies/content-policies )
        confirm that our customers have the right to freely access and distribute content so long as their manner in doing so
        respects others’ use of networks and complies with the law. Decisions to terminate or restrict access to Verizon’s
        consumer services are made in accordance with our publicly-available terms and conditions for the relevant service. Reasons
        that Verizon suspends or terminates services generally include non-payment, fraud, abuse, or other violations of law,
        such as using our services for purposes that infringe upon others’ intellectual property rights. We do not take
        religious or political views into account in our decision-making. High-volume text messaging
        campaigns. Text messages are among the most trusted ways for consumers to communicate with one another and receive
        communications from organizations that they have given permission to text them. Verizon is committed to stopping spam
        text messages while ensuring that all wanted communications reach our customers. We require organizations sending high
        volumes of texts to consumers to adhere to industry guidelines and best practices ( https://www.ctia.org/the-wireless-industry/industry-commitments/messaging-interoperability-sms-mms )
        that apply to all types of organizations, including political campaigns and businesses. Our website ( https://verizon.com/about/account-security/smishing-and-spam-text-messages )
        also explains the steps that a business, political campaign, or other organization should take to make sure that text
        messages will get through to consumers. These include obtaining consumers’ opt-in consent to receive messages, ensuring
        that consumers have the ability to opt-out from receiving all future messages from a sender, honoring consumer opt-outs,
        and taking steps described in the industry guidelines to not send unwanted messages. These guidelines are designed
        to apply the same standards and same consumer protections to all senders, and are applied without regard to an organization’s
        political or religious views. Given our commitment to nondiscrimination, as well as
        our transparent policies and guidelines related to account suspension, account termination, and high-volume text messaging,
        we believe that the report requested by the proponents is not in the best interest of shareholders. 73 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Item 9: Lead-sheathed cable report The Association of BellTel Retirees Inc., owner of 214 shares
of Verizon’s common stock, proposes the following: Study and Report to Shareholders on Lead-Sheathed Cables Resolved: The shareholders request that Verizon Communications
undertake a comprehensive independent study and publicly release an independent report by December 2024 that demonstrates the
Company has assessed all potential sources of liability related to lead-sheathed cables, including a comprehensive mapping of
the locations impacted and conclusions on the potential cost of remediation, along with the most responsible and cost-effective
way to prioritize the remediation of sites that pose a risk to public health. SUPPORTING STATEMENT In July 2023 The Wall Street Journal published
a major report stating that telecommunications companies “have left behind a sprawling network of cables covered in toxic
lead that stretches across the U.S., under the water, in the soil and on poles overhead.” The story continued: “As
the lead degrades, it is ending up in places where Americans live, work and play.” The Journal noted that the former AT&T laid
lead-sheathed cables up until the 1960s, when the industry began using plastic sheathing and then fiber optic cables. However,
the lead-sheathed cables remained in place. These disclosures sparked public health and environmental concerns
as to employees who worked regularly with lead-sheathed cables and as to communities where lead, a toxic metal, can contaminate
soil and water. A former EPA official said the Journal findings
suggest that buried cables could pose a significant problem “everywhere,” and “you’re not going to know where
it is in a lot of places.” An environmental public health professor stated that this “new uncontrolled source of lead”
may help explain “why children continue to have lead in their blood,” adding: “We never knew about it so we
never acted on it, unlike lead in paint and pipes.” The revelations prompted action by federal and state regulators
and demands for action from elected officials. Verizon’s responded that “[w]e take the matter seriously,” that lead-sheathed
cables are “a small percentage” of our copper network, and that the likelihood of lead exposure was “low.”
Verizon added that records on the extent of lead sheathing are “incomplete,” but the Company was investigating sites
identified by the Journal and when the results are in, Verizon will “work with our industry and others
to address concerns and issues.” Apart from the public health and environmental concerns, this
issue raises significant cost concerns for investors. An analyst for New Street Research estimated remediation costs between $10-$26
billion, although government programs may play a role. In the first months after the story broke, Verizon has said little
publicly on this issue. We acknowledge Verizon’s rather vague claims it is “investigating,” but believe that the potential
scale, public health risks and cost of this matter warrant the sort of comprehensive and independent examination recommended here. This issue is too important to be allowed to slip from public
sight. Lead remediation efforts in other industries have dragged on for years, and we believe it is important for Verizon to be
ahead of the curve. The Board of Directors
        recommends that you vote AGAINST this
        proposal for the following reasons: We
    take the health and safety of our communities and of our workforce very seriously. Verizon, with oversight from the Board
    of Directors, has already undertaken substantial efforts to assess whether lead-sheathed cables present a health or environmental
    concern. These efforts have included third-party testing, disclosure of test results, a review of our network architecture,
    and long-standing efforts to protect employee health and safety. The results of the testing we conducted in 2023 do not indicate
    that there is an immediate public health risk requiring remediation associated with lead-sheathed cables. The Board believes
    that conducting the additional third-party assessment requested by the proponent would be duplicative and also could interfere
    with the Company’s ongoing engagement with federal and state agencies on this matter. 74 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Assessment and third-party testing. Lead-sheathed
        infrastructure makes up a small percentage of our network and the industry began moving away from installing new lead-sheathed
        cable by the 1950s. It is our understanding that when cables are not disturbed, the likelihood of exposure to lead from
        lead- sheathed cables is low. When we became aware of claims in the Wall Street Journal related to lead-sheathed cables,
        we took action to determine if there is, in fact, a concern presented by these facilities. We engaged an external team
        of experts to support our internal team in assessing the facts, including working with a third party expert to conduct
        testing. We are also reviewing our network architecture to pinpoint where lead-sheathed cables remain. Disclosure of testing results. We
        publicly disclosed information about the results of the testing we conducted in 2023 ( https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-reports-lead-test-results-continues-work-epa ),
        which do not indicate that there is an immediate public health risk requiring remediation associated with lead-sheathed
        cables. Our test results at the Wappingers Falls location were consistent with those found by the New York State Department
        of Health: soil lead levels near Verizon’s cable there are similar to lead levels in the surrounding area (i.e.,
        background levels). Our test results in West Orange, New Jersey were also consistent with the Environmental Protection
        Agency (EPA)’s findings, which concluded that its review of data “indicate that there are no immediate threats
        to the health of people nearby.” Our results were similar for Coal Center, Pennsylvania, a third Verizon location
        mentioned in the articles, and the EPA issued a statement that based on its testing, a “scientific review of the
        data and current conditions in the area indicate that there are no threats to the health of people nearby that would warrant
        an immediate EPA response action.” We provided our testing results to the EPA and state environmental agencies and
        will continue to work closely with them to determine next steps. Protecting employees. We have longstanding
        efforts dating back decades to protect the health and safety of our employees that perform work on lead-sheathed cables.
        For the small percentage of our workforce that may need to work around lead, we have a robust program to provide training,
        materials, and resources to do so safely. We have worked closely with union representatives on these processes, including
        on the development and roll-out of our safety training. Verizon also has several avenues through which employees may raise
        concerns about health and safety as well as other matters, including through employees’ managers and local EHS representatives,
        as well as our EHS hotline and mailbox and our Verizon Ethics hotline and online web portal. Board oversight and coordination with relevant agencies. Our
        executives and our Board of Directors are regularly briefed on and actively engaged in overseeing our efforts on this
        matter. We also are proactively working with the EPA and continue to work closely with our industry, environmental agencies,
        and others to address this matter. Guided by science and our commitment to the health and
        safety of our communities and workforce, Verizon has taken several steps to assess whether lead-sheathed cables present
        a public health concern. Our 2023 test results do not indicate that there is an immediate public health risk requiring
        remediation associated with lead-sheathed cables. Conducting the additional third-party assessment requested by the proponent,
        which would cover investigation and analysis that we have already conducted and will continue to be undertaking in concert
        with the EPA, would not provide value to shareholders. 75 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Item 10: Political expenditures misalignment The Woodcock Foundation, owner of 1,803 shares of Verizon’s
common stock, and two co-sponsors propose the following: Political Expenditures Misalignment with
Company Strategy WHEREAS: According to public data collected by OpenSecrets.org,
Verizon Communications Inc. and its employee PAC have ranked in the top 1% of political donors in every election cycle since at least
2012. 1 As the Supreme Court has explained, transparency in corporate electoral
spending “permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way” by providing “shareholders
and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable.” 2 Greater political spending transparency is associated with “better
internal corporate decision-making” and “facilitates a positive relationship between corporate political spending and
future financial performance.” 3 By contrast, political donations to candidates that do not fully align
with a company’s stated values and commitments may create long-tail reputational risks to the Company when recipients engage in
polarizing political acts. The impacts on a company may include difficulties in recruiting and retaining talented employees, shareholder
dissatisfaction, and public backlash and boycotts. 4 Verizon publicly discloses a policy on corporate political spending
and its direct contributions to candidates, parties, and committees. Verizon does not, however, disclose information regarding
misalignment between its political spending and the Company’s strategic and operational needs or its publicly stated values and
vision as articulated in its corporate responsibility reporting. As a result, investors are unable to determine if Verizon is
directing its political expenditures in a way that is consistent with the Company’s strategic needs, values, and interests. Clear
policies and reporting on Verizon’s political spending would provide investors with assurance that the inherent brand risk associated
with political spending is well-managed. RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board annually
report, at reasonable expense, on Verizon’s political and electioneering expenditures, identifying and analyzing incongruence
between such expenditures and the Company’s operational and strategic needs and its stated values and policies. The report should
state whether Verizon has made, or plans to make, changes in contributions or communications as a result of identified incongruencies. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Proponents recommend, at management
discretion, that Verizon include in its analysis metrics that illuminate the degree to which political contributions align with
stated strategy, values, and policy priorities year-over-year and present such metrics in the aggregate. Proponents further recommend
the report contain management’s analysis of political spending risks to our Company’s brand, reputation, or shareholder value
that might arise from spending from the corporate treasury or from its PACs, directly or through third parties, which are reasonably
susceptible to interpretation as being in support of or in opposition to a specific candidate. 1 https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/verizon-communications/summary?id=D000000079 2 https://www.fec.gov/resources/legal-resources/litigation/cu_sc08_opinion.pdf,

        recommends that you vote AGAINST this
        proposal for the following reasons: Verizon is committed to responsible engagement in the
        political process, and we maintain a strong reputation for responsible political spending with a ranking in the first
        tier of companies in the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability. Our engagement in the
        political process includes political contributions to candidates from both major political parties in the United States.
        We have put robust policies, governance, oversight, and transparency in place to align contributions with our business
        strategy and policy priorities, and to mitigate reputational risk. The Board believes that the additional report requested
        by the proponent will not further shareholder interests. The importance of political
        engagement. Verizon is affected by a wide variety of government policies that significantly impact our business.
        Given the highly regulated, highly competitive nature of our industry, it is crucial that Verizon participates actively
        in the political process. Our Political Engagement Report ( https://www.verizon.com/about/investors/political-contributions-report-archive )
        sets out our public policy priorities, which are mission-critical to our business and include maintaining the United States’
        leadership in 5G, ensuring access to licensed spectrum, and the affordability of and access to broadband services that
        will help narrow or eliminate the digital divide. Other companies, including Verizon’s competitors, often have opposing
        views on these critical policy issues, and some of those companies are among the most active political contributors in
        this space. Political contributions. Verizon makes corporate
        political contributions where the law permits, and Verizon operates several political action committees (PACs) that support
        candidates at the federal, state and local levels who make decisions on policy issues that impact Verizon. We make contributions
        to candidates for political office, and organizations that support candidates for office and ballot initiatives. We do
        not make corporate political contributions or PAC contributions to presidential candidates or federal Super PACs. Verizon makes every effort to align our political contributions,
        corporate purpose and overall business strategy, and organizational values. Bipartisan political giving is foundational
        to our political engagement strategy. We support candidates of any political party who share our priorities, even if we
        do not agree with them on every issue. The criteria we use to inform our decision whether to support a particular
        candidate are wide-ranging and include general alignment with our business objectives, a candidate’s committee assignments
        and committee standing and ranking, their leadership position and track record on strategic business and policy issues
        for Verizon, and whether a candidate’s stated views or voting records advance our corporate purpose and organizational
        values. To mitigate reputational risk, we review whether a candidate has made public statements on sensitive public policy
        issues that have resulted in controversy, and the nature and impact of any such statement. We recognize that we will not always agree with every
        stated position of every candidate or organization that we contribute to and that every candidate or organization will
        not always reflect all of Verizon’s beliefs or priorities. When Verizon makes decisions on political support, we
        consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether support is, on balance, in the best interest
        of Verizon, our shareholders, employees and customers. These decisions are multifaceted and at times can be complex, always
        requiring oversight and governance. 77 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Governance and oversight. The Corporate Governance
        and Policy Committee oversees Verizon’s participation in the political process including political giving, memberships
        and trade associations and reputational risk. The Committee receives a comprehensive report and briefing on our political
        activities at least annually. All of Verizon’s political activity is subject to the Company’s Code of Conduct
        and other corporate policies, and is directly overseen by the Senior Vice President of Public Policy and Government Affairs.
        The Legal Department reviews all corporate political contributions to ensure consistency with the Company’s policy
        and strategy and compliance with the law, and senior leaders in the Public Policy and Government Affairs organization
        approve all PAC contributions. Members of Verizon’s PAC boards evaluate and approve the PAC budget and our giving
        to candidates to ensure that contributions to each candidate meet the criteria described above. Transparency. Verizon is committed to transparency
        regarding our political engagement activities, including political contributions. Twice a year, Verizon publishes our
        Political Engagement Report, which includes information about our policy priorities, governance and oversight, and all
        of our corporate political contributions and PAC contributions. Additionally, in accordance with applicable laws, Verizon’s
        PACs file public reporting with the Federal Election Commission and state and local campaign finance regulators. We aim to be responsive to feedback from our shareholders
        on how we can enhance transparency related to our political engagement efforts. By our 2024 mid-year Political Engagement
        Report, we will revise the information we provide on significant memberships and will disclose an estimate of the amount
        of Verizon’s payments used for lobbying activities. Verizon has a strong reputation for transparency and
        responsible political spending. We have a rigorous process in place to govern and oversee our political contributions,
        which includes consideration of reputational risk, and we are transparent about those contributions and our policy priorities.
        Bipartisan political giving is foundational to our strategy and the Board believes that the additional report requested
        by the proponent will not further shareholder interests. 78 Back to Contents Proxy summary Governance Executive compensation Audit matters Stock ownership Shareholder proposals Additional information Additional information Additional information about our annual meeting Our meeting details Date, time and virtual meeting site Thursday, May 9, 2024 10:00 AM, Eastern Daylight Time The meeting will be held virtually via the Internet at meetnow.global/VZ2024 ,
