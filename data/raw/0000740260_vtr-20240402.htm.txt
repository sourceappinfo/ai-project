With the completion of our 25th anniversary year in 2023, we look back at a period of exceptional growth, shareholder value creation and strategic progress. And we are just getting started, as Ventas meets accelerating demand from a large and growing aging population. Unified by these powerful demographic tailwinds, our senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research and healthcare properties are enabling exceptional environments that help people live longer, healthier, happier lives. With a focused strategy, we are: Delivering Superior Stockholder Returns We believe our advantaged position and portfolio present a unique opportunity to deliver growth and value for stockholders. In 2023, Ventas delivered over 15% Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and outperformed the Nareit Healthcare REIT Index and MSCI U.S. REIT Index for the second consecutive year. Our nearly 18% annualized TSR since January 1, 2000 reflects the power of our business as a leader in the essential and rapidly growing market fueled by demographic demand. Driving Operational Performance & Financial Strength Our enterprise delivered strong fundamental performance in 2023. We achieved significant organic property growth from our portfolio of ~1,400 high quality assets unified by demographic demand. The engine of our success was our senior housing portfolio, which is in the early stages of an unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity supported by compelling supply demand fundamentals and amplified by our decisive market, asset and operator actions. Our senior housing growth was complemented by compounding contributions from our outpatient medical and research assets and our triple-net leased portfolio. Demand for our asset classes is strong and getting stronger, putting us in an advantaged position within commercial real estate. While interest rates increased for all companies during 2023, we were distinguished by organic growth from our portfolio that well outpaced the impact of these increases. We further strengthened our capital position last year by raising more than $4 billion of attractively priced capital ahead of rising interest rates, enabling us to pay down near-term debt maturities. We ended 2023 with enhanced liquidity of more than $3 billion. Our ability to raise significant capital at favorable rates demonstrates the advantages of our size, scale and access to diverse capital sources, and puts us in a strong financial position as we execute on our strategy to drive growth and stockholder value. "Our advantaged position and portfolio present a unique opportunity to deliver growth and value for stockholders." 2024 | Proxy Statement i Table of Contents Letter to Ventas Stockholders Capturing the Opportunity in Senior Housing As the second largest owner of senior housing, Ventas occupies a superior position to capture the compelling organic growth opportunity embedded in our existing portfolio and build our scale with new investments focused on U.S. senior housing. With the over 80 population projected to grow 24% through 2029 and construction starts the lowest they have been since 2009, our senior housing portfolio has already started to deliver on an unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity. We intend to expand our footprint in U.S. senior housing by acquiring new communities and leveraging our industry-leading data analytics capabilities, the experience and insights of our team and our strong, collaborative relationships with operators. By 2026, when the first of more than 70 million baby boomers turn 80, the opportunity in senior housing should shine even brighter, as we deliver valuable services and security that benefit this large and growing group of residents and their families. Guided by a Strong, Independent Board Our strategy and execution are overseen by a strong, independent and deeply engaged Board, with the right mix of experience, skills and judgment. Our highly accomplished directors have significant executive leadership, investment, financial and operating experience across real estate, healthcare, development, REITs and public companies. Twelve of our 13 current directors are independent and they regularly come together with the goal of making decisions that will improve performance for our stakeholders. Seven have been added since the beginning of 2019. In 2024, we welcomed Theodore R. Bigman and Joe V. Rodriguez, Jr., seasoned REIT investors who bring new perspectives to our excellent Board. As we welcome new directors, we recognize the contributions of James D. ("Denny") Shelton, who has decided to retire after more than 16 years of service on the Board, including eight years as Lead Independent Director. The Board has selected Roxanne M. Martino to succeed Denny as Lead Independent Director, effective immediately following the 2024 Annual Meeting. A Unique Opportunity for Growth and Value Creation We are excited to continue delivering growth led by our advantaged position in senior housing. As we enable exceptional environments that benefit the aging population amid unprecedented growth in the demographic we serve, we have a unique opportunity to create value for our stakeholders. We appreciate your trust in our Company and are dedicated to rewarding that trust with results and performance. Sincerely, Debra A.

Additional information concerning the composition of our Board and our director nominees can be found under Proposal 1: Election of Directors. Executive Compensation The second item on the agenda is an advisory vote on our executive compensation program. Our executive compensation program reflects our philosophy that compensation should be linked to performance, align with stockholder experience and attract, retain and motivate talented employees. We benchmark our executive compensation against that of our peers to ensure that our executives’ pay is appropriate based on their roles, responsibilities and years of experience. A significant proportion of target executive compensation — more th an 80% o f the 2023 target compensation of our Named Executive Officers — is in the form of equity and cash incentive awards tied to pre-identified performance measures such that an executive’s realized pay is closely tied to the Company’s performance. At our 2023 annual meeting, our executive compensation program received the support of over 90% of votes cast and our conversations with our stockholders during 2023 indicate that our stockholders are generally supportive of our executive compensation program. Additional information regarding our executive compensation program can be found in the section titled Proposal 2: Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers. Auditor The third item on the agenda for the 2024 Annual Meeting is approval of the selection of KPMG as our auditors for 2024 . KPMG was first engaged to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm in July 2014.

The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee considers potential candidates during the course of the year on an ongoing basis as part of our Board refreshment process. In accordance with our Guidelines on Governance (our “Guidelines”), the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee annually considers and recommends to the Board a slate of director nominees for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders. In making its recommendations, the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee considers: • high-performing, independent incumbent directors who have indicated a willingness to continue serving on our Board; • candidates, if any, nominated by our stockholders in accordance with the Company’s organizational documents and applicable laws; and • other candidates determined by the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee. Our Guidelines provide that, in general, director nominees should have one or more of the following qualifications and characteristics: • demonstrated management or technical ability at high levels in successful organizations; • currently or previously employed in positions of significant responsibility and decision-making; • experience relevant to our operations, such as real estate, real estate investment trusts, healthcare, finance or general management; • well-respected in their business and home communities; • time to devote to Board duties; • independent from us and not related to our other directors or employees; • integrity; • independence; • leadership ability, and a proven record of accomplishment; • personal commitment of time and effort; • expertise in business, professional, academic, political or community affairs; • willingness to evaluate, challenge and stimulate; and • candor. In evaluating and recruiting director nominees and candidates, the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee considers each potential nominee's skill set, demonstrated business acumen and experience, alignment with the Company's stockholder value-creation strategy, outside commitments and ability to contribute sufficient time to the Board's discussion and decision-making process as part of their service on the Board. The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee also evaluates each potential nominee or candidate's independence and any actual or potential conflicts of interest. Nominees and candidates must have a reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to the highest standards of professional and personal ethics. In general, the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee seeks to include on the Ventas Board a complementary mix of individuals with diverse backgrounds, knowledge and viewpoints responsive to the broad set of challenges that the Company confronts. Among other things, the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee considers age, gender, racial and ethnic demographics and other diversity factors when recruiting and evaluating nominees and candidates. Our directors are expected to be active participants in governing our enterprise. The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee seeks to recommend nominees who have adequate time to devote to Board activities, recognizing that public company boards of directors command a significant portion of directors’ time. Accordingly, the Company maintains an overboarding policy that prohibits anyone who serves as a Chief Executive Officer of a public company from simultaneously serving on more than two public company boards in addition to the Company’s Board and prohibits all other directors from simultaneously serving on more than four public company boards in addition to the Company’s Board. The Company also prohibits Audit and Compliance Committee members from simultaneously serving on more than two additional public company audit committees. 24 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters No single factor or group of factors is necessarily dispositive of whether a candidate will be recommended by our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee. The Committee will consider candidates recommended by stockholders and applies these same standards in evaluating individuals in that context. Candidates recommended by stockholders must meet the criteria and qualifications described above. Stockholders may submit recommendations to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at 353 North Clark Street, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois 60654. Director nominations by our stockholders must follow the procedures described in the “Additional Information—Submission of Stockholder Proposals and Other Items for 2025 Annual Meeting” section of this Proxy Statement. Refreshment and Succession Planning The Board is committed to effective succession planning and a rigorous, ongoing refreshment program. The average tenure of our independent director nominees is approximately five years as of the date of the 2024 Annual Meeting. Including our CEO, the average tenure is approximately seven years as of the date of the 2024 Annual Meeting. Our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee monitors the average tenure of our directors and seeks to achieve a variety of director tenures in order to benefit from long-tenured directors’ institutional knowledge and newly elected directors’ fresh perspectives. Since the beginning of 2019, we have appointed seven new directors to the Board of Directors. James D. Shelton, our Lead Independent Directors and a valued director who has served on the Board since 2008, will not be standing for re-election at the 2024 Annual Meeting. The independent members of Board have selected Roxanne M. Martino as the Company's Lead Independent Director, effective immediately following the 2024 Annual Meeting. On March 4, 2024, we continued the ongoing refreshment of the Board with the appointment of Theodore R. Bigman and Joe V. Rodriguez, Jr. as directors. Mr. Bigman was identified as a candidate as a result of the Company's receipt of a nomination notice from its shareholder, Land & Buildings Investment Management. Mr. Rodriguez was identified as a candidate by a third-party search firm retained by the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee. In its annual review of the Board’s composition, the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee considers succession planning in light of factors such as skills, experience and qualifications needed, the Company’s strategy, director feedback (including from the annual Board self-evaluation), stockholder perspectives shared during our annual engagement process and upcoming retirements and other potential departures. The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee conducts an enhanced evaluation of any director with more than fifteen (15) years of service on the Board and provides the Board with a detailed explanation as to the determinative factors for nominating such director for another term if the Committee recommends that such candidate be nominated for election. 2024 | Proxy Statement 25 Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Director Recruitment Our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee has the authority to identify, consider and recommend candidates to the Board. An overview of the Board’s director recruitment process is provided below: Evaluate Board Composition The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee periodically reviews Board composition and the skills, experience and qualifications held by existing directors and those sought in candidates, considering the needs of the Board in light of the Company’s strategy, director feedback (including from the annual Board self-evaluation), stockholder perspectives and upcoming retirements and other potential departures. Identify Candidates Based on its assessment of Board composition, the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee identifies a candidate profile to guide the Committee’s search and may retain a third-party search firm to assist in identifying and evaluating candidates. Candidates may also be recommended by our stockholders, existing directors, advisors and other sources. Assess Candidates Candidates are assessed against the criteria outlined in “—Director Recruitment, Nomination and Succession Planning” and the skills, experience and qualifications shown in “Board Nominees— Director Nominees Skills, Experience, Qualifications and Attributes Matrix,” as well as the future needs of the Board, including succession planning. The Committee, with the assistance of the Corporate Secretary, reviews candidates for independence and potential conflicts. Interview Candidates Qualified top candidates are interviewed by members of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and other Board members, as appropriate. In some cases, candidates are also screened by search firms and interviewed by members of management. Recommend Candidates The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee recommends candidates to the Board for appointment or nomination for election. Stockholder Vote Stockholders vote on director nominees at the annual meeting of stockholders. Seven New Directors Added Since 2019 Ethnic and gender diversity Expertise in investor perspectives All independent Expertise in investments, finance, accounting, life sciences, technology, research and innovation, healthcare and REITs 26 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Independence Our Guidelines require that at least a majority of the members of our Board meet the criteria for independence under the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). For a director to be considered independent under the NYSE’s listing standards, the director must satisfy certain tests, and the Board must affirmatively determine that the director has no direct or indirect material relationship (other than as a director) with us. Not less than annually, our Board evaluates the independence of each non-management director on a case-by-case basis by considering any matters that could affect their ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, including all transactions and relationships between that director, members of their family and organizations with which that director or their family members have an affiliation, on the one hand, and us, our subsidiaries and our management, on the other hand. The Board has affirmatively determined that all of the Company’s current directors and directors who served during 2023, with the exception of Ms. Cafaro, are independent under the NYSE’s listing standards based on its most recent review, which applied the standards described above. Under the NYSE listing standards, Ms. Cafaro is not considered independent due to her employment as our CEO. The Board has also determined that: • all of the members of the Audit and Compliance Committee are independent under the applicable rules of the NYSE the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) respectively; and • all of the members of the Compensation Committee are independent, non-employee directors, under the applicable rules of the NYSE and the SEC respectively. In determining that Mr. Lustig is independent, the Board considered that he is employed by Lazard Frères & Co. LLC ("Lazard"), a financial institution that, with its affiliates, has from time to time provided financial advisory and investment banking services in the ordinary course of business to the Company and its subsidiaries, for which Lazard has received customary compensation, fees and expense reimbursement. The Board did not believe that the Company’s relationship with Lazard impacted the independence of Mr. Lustig for the following reasons: • Lazard is a large multi-national financial institution with which the Company had a commercial relationship for many years prior to Mr. Lustig’s appointment to the Board; • amounts paid by the Company to Lazard for the services described above represent an immaterial percentage of Lazard’s gross revenues; and • Mr. Lustig is not involved in providing the services described above, either directly or indirectly, does not derive any specific benefits in the form of direct compensation tied to the amounts paid by the Company to Lazard for such services and such amounts are well below the amounts that would preclude a finding of independence under the NYSE listing standards and are otherwise immaterial to Mr. Lustig. In March, 2024, the Board adopted a policy that states that the Company will not engage any entity that employs a director on a full-time basis to provide financial advisory or investment banking services with respect to any acquisition, disposition, restructuring, joint venture or other transactional matter. Such policy is not intended to preclude the Company from engaging any such entity for other purposes, such as to provide routine or administrative services in connection with the Company’s workforce compensation or benefit programs, subject to compliance with any other applicable policies of the Company, including those governing related party transactions. Director Resignation Policy In accordance with our Director Resignation Policy, our Board will nominate an incumbent director for election only if the director agrees that, in the event the director fails to receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election at our annual meeting, they will tender an irrevocable resignation that will be effective upon acceptance by the Board. If an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election at our annual meeting, our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee will act on an expedited basis to determine whether to recommend acceptance or rejection of the director’s resignation and submit its recommendation for prompt consideration by the Board. Our Board will act on the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee’s recommendation and publicly disclose its decision regarding the tendered resignation by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC no later than 90 days following certification of the election results. 2024 | Proxy Statement 27 Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Director Retirement Under our Guidelines, a non-management director is required to retire at the first annual meeting of stockholders following their 75th birthday. On the recommendation of our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee, our Board may waive this requirement if it deems a waiver to be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. Annual Board Self-Evaluation The Board recognizes that a robust and constructive evaluation process is an essential component of good corporate governance and Board effectiveness. The Board and each of its committees conduct self-evaluations through completion of written questionnaires related to their performance on an annual basis. Through this process, directors provide feedback and assess Board, committee and director performance, including areas where the Board believes it is functioning effectively and areas where the Board believes it can improve. The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee supervises the annual self-evaluations and uses various processes to solicit feedback, including periodic interviews conducted by the Chair of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee with each of the other directors. The Board and each committee review and discuss the evaluation results, take this information into account when assessing the qualifications of the Board and use the feedback to develop changes to enhance Board and committee effectiveness as appropriate. Director Orientation and Continuing Education New directors typically participate in an orientation coordinated by the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and management. New directors engage with senior management to review the Company’s strategic plans, significant financial, accounting and risk management matters, compliance programs, corporate governance practices, key policies, principal officers, internal and independent auditors and other key service providers. We provide new directors with written materials to supplement the management meetings to permit them to further understand our business and industry. Informally, our directors also meet individually with new directors as part of the new director onboarding. We expect our directors to be well informed about the Company’s business, the competitive landscape in which the Company operates and issues currently affecting the Company, the healthcare and life science, research and innovation industries, the real estate investment trust industry, matters of corporate governance and the broader economy. Because our Board believes that ongoing director education is vital to the development of best practices and helps directors fulfill their fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders, directors are encouraged to participate in continuing education programs. The Company covers the fees, costs and expenses associated with attendance at one director education program per year for each director. 28 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Our Corporate Governance Framework Commitment to Strong Governance Practices Accountability to Stockholders Director Commitment • Annual Board Elections • Majority Vote in Uncontested Director Elections with Director Resignation Policy • Stockholders’ Right to Act by Written Consent • Proxy Access Provided for in Our Organizational Documents • Overboarding Policy: No More than Two Additional Public Company Boards for Directors Who Are Executive Officers of Public Companies (including our CEO) and Four Additional Public Company Boards for All Other Directors • Audit Committee Overboarding Policy: No More than Two Additional Public Company Audit Committees • Board and Committees Meet Regularly • Directors Attended More Than 75% of Meetings of the Board and the Committees on Which They Sat Board Independence • All Directors Except CEO are Independent • All Board Committees Are 100% Independent • Lead Independent Director • Independent Directors Meet Without Management (generally at every meeting) Director Diversity, Refreshment & Tenure • Strong Track Record of Refreshment with 58% of Independent Directors on the Board for <6 years • Seven New Board Members since the beginning of 2019 • One-third of director nominees are Women; the Board Chair, incoming Lead Independent Director and two of the Board’s Three NYSE-Required Committees Chaired by Women • One-third of director nominees are Ethnically Diverse • Mandatory Retirement Age: 75 Alignment with Stockholder Interests Board Performance • Annual Director Equity Grants • Robust Director and Executive Officer Stock Ownership Guidelines • Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy • Commitment to Corporate Sustainability • Board- and Committee-level Oversight of Corporate Responsibility, ESG and Human Capital Management • Annual Board and Committee Evaluations • Annual Committee and Committee Chair Rotation Evaluation Process • Annual Assessment of Board Leadership Structure and Election of Lead Independent Director • Board Orientation for New Directors • Continuing Director Education Robust Stockholder Engagement • Year-Round Engagement by Board and Senior Management • Board-Led Stockholder Outreach Program for Over a Decade • Top 50+ Stockholders Representing Approximately 73% of Outstanding Shares Invited to Engage with Independent Directors at Least Biannually 2024 | Proxy Statement 29 Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Corporate Governance Guidelines Our Guidelines reflect the fundamental corporate governance principles by which our Board and its committees operate. They set forth general practices the Board and its committees follow with respect to structure, function, organization, composition and conduct. These Guidelines are reviewed at least annually by the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and are updated periodically in response to changing regulatory requirements, evolving corporate governance practices, input from our stockholders and otherwise as circumstances warrant. Independent Compensation Advisor The Compensation Committee has retained an independent compensation advisor, Semler Brossy Consulting Group (“Semler Brossy”), to provide advice regarding the overall executive and non-employee director compensation programs, including (i) selecting appropriate peer companies for benchmarking purposes; (ii) setting base salaries and incentive award opportunities; (iii) establishing and evaluating achievement of applicable performance measures and related goals under our incentive plans; (iv) determining annual cash and long-term equity incentive awards for our executive officers; and (v) setting cash and equity award levels for our non-employee directors. Semler Brossy reports to the Compensation Committee and received no fees from us that were unrelated to its role as advisor to our Board and its committees during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the scope of work provided by Semler Brossy, as required under the Compensation Committee Charter. After considering the specific independence factors set forth in Rule 10C-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and all other relevant facts and circumstances, the Compensation Committee concluded in its reasonable business judgment that Semler Brossy met the independence criteria and determined that Semler Brossy’s work for the Board and its committees raised no conflict of interest. Transactions with Related Persons We did not have any related persons transactions during 2023. Our Guidelines on Transactions with Related Persons and our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct outline our standards and procedures regarding transactions with related persons. Any transaction involving us in which any of our directors, officers or 5% or greater stockholders (or their immediate family members) has a direct or indirect material interest must be approved or ratified by the Audit and Compliance Committee, the disinterested members of our Board or, in certain limited circumstances, the Chair of our Audit and Compliance Committee. Our directors, officers and employees are required to disclose any existing or proposed transaction in which they have a personal interest, or in which there is or might appear to be a conflict of interest, to our General Counsel in writing. Our General Counsel reviews these matters with the Lead Independent Director to determine whether the transaction raises a conflict of interest that warrants review and approval by the Audit and Compliance Committee or the disinterested members of the Board. In determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction, the Audit and Compliance Committee or disinterested members of the Board consider all relevant facts and circumstances and such other information as they deem appropriate, based on the information available to them. Prohibition on Hedging and Pledging of Our Securities Our Securities Trading Policy includes restrictions on both hedging and pledging of Company securities. Specifically, the policy: • prohibits our directors, executive officers and employees and certain of their related persons from buying or selling any put or call options, warrants or similar derivative instruments with respect to Company securities, or any other financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Company securities; • prohibits directors, executive officers and employees from engaging in “short sales” with respect to Company securities; and • prohibits our directors and executive officers from holding our securities in margin accounts or otherwise pledging our securities to secure loans. No director or executive officer hedged, pledged or held our securities in margin accounts at any time during 2023. 30 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Codes of Ethics, Human Rights and Vendor Code of Conduct Our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct sets forth the legal and ethical standards for conducting our business. All of our directors and employees, including our CEO, our CFO and the directors, officers and employees of our subsidiaries must comply with our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and the policies that support it. Our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct covers significant areas of professional conduct, including employment practices, conflicts of interest, unfair or unethical use of corporate opportunities, protection of confidential information and other Company assets, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, political activities and other public policy matters and proper and timely reporting of financial results. See also “— Public Policy Matters.” Our Human Rights Policy reflects our commitment to upholding human dignity and equal opportunity in all of our business functions under principles outlined in the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our Vendor Code of Conduct is designed to educate our suppliers about our expectations for ethical and responsible business dealings, including upholding human rights, protecting health and safety and pursuing environmental sustainability. Our expectation is that our vendors will treat people with respect and dignity, encourage diversity, promote equal opportunity for all and create an ethical and inclusive culture. Our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Human Rights Policy and Vendor Code of Conduct are available in the Corporate Governance section of our website (which is not a part of the Proxy Statement) at www.ventasreit.com . We also provide copies of our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Human Rights Policy and Vendor Code of Conduct, without charge, upon request to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at 353 North Clark Street, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois 60654. Public Policy Matters We are committed to ethical business conduct. In our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, our Global Anti- Corruption Policy and our Political Contribution, Expenditure and Activity Policy, we have established policies and practices with respect to political contributions and other public policy matters. Our funds, assets and other resources may not be used to make a political contribution to any state or local government official or candidate or any SuperPACs. If approved in advance in writing by the Company’s General Counsel, Ventas funds, assets and other resources may from time to time be used to support a political action committee or other political organization or a charity or non-profit organization at the request of a state or local governmental official or candidate, in each case to the extent permitted by law and not otherwise prohibited by our policies. On an annual basis, we publish a list disclosing our use of corporate funds for direct lobbying at the federal level, membership dues to certain industry groups or trade associations and payments to 501(c)(4) organizations for the purpose of writing and endorsing model legislation. Certain officers and other employees who support our Ventas Investment Management business are subject to additional restrictions, certifications and training requirements with respect to political contributions, expenditures and activities. Board Leadership Structure Our Board recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine its optimal leadership structure so as to provide effective oversight of management and a fully engaged, high-functioning Board. The Board understands that no single approach to Board leadership is universally accepted and that the appropriate leadership structure may vary based on a company’s size, industry, operations, history and culture. Consistent with this understanding, our Board, led by our independent Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee, annually assesses its leadership structure in light of our operating and governance environment at the time to achieve the optimal model for us and for our stockholders. Chairman The Chairman of the Board is elected annually by the independent directors at the first Board meeting following the election of directors at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders. 2024 | Proxy Statement 31 Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Ms. Cafaro has served as CEO and Chairman of the Board since 2003, and our Board continues to believe that her combined role is most advantageous to us and our stockholders. Following its most recent assessment of its leadership structure, the Board determined that our existing leadership structure — under which our CEO also serves as Chairman of the Board and a Lead Independent Director assumes specific responsibilities on behalf of the independent directors — is effective, provides the appropriate balance of authority between those persons charged with overseeing our Company and those who manage it on a day-to-day basis and achieves the optimal governance model for us and for our stockholders. Ms. Cafaro possesses extensive knowledge of the issues, opportunities and risks facing us, our business and our industry and has consistently demonstrated the vision and leadership necessary to focus the Board’s time and attention on the most critical matters and to facilitate constructive dialogue among Board members on strategic issues. Moreover, the combined roles enable decisive leadership, clear accountability and consistent communication of our message and strategy to all of our stakeholders. These leadership attributes are uniquely important to our Company given the value to our business of opportunistic capital markets execution, our history of rapid and significant growth and our culture of proactive engagement and risk management. Lead Independent Director Our Guidelines require that our independent directors annually elect one independent director to serve as Lead Independent Director if the Chairman is not an independent director. On March 4, 2024, Mr. Shelton, who has served as our Lead Independent Director since 2016, notified the Board that he would not stand for reelection at the Company's 2024 Annual Meeting. Upon receipt of Mr. Shelton's notice, the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee reviewed the notice and recommended that the Board accept it. Following the acceptance of Mr. Shelton's notice, the Board then resolved that Roxanne M.

The Board is responsible for, among other things: • overseeing the Company’s strategy, including major financial objectives, plans and actions; • overseeing and evaluating the Company’s performance and management of the Company’s business; • overseeing the processes established by management to assess, monitor and mitigate the major risks facing the Company; • nominating, compensating and evaluating directors; • selecting, compensating, evaluating and, when necessary, replacing the CEO and other executive officers and overseeing compensation policies generally applicable to employees of the Company; • overseeing the implementation of policies and procedures designed to ensure legal and ethical conduct of the Company’s business activities, strong internal controls and fiscal accountability; • making provision for a succession plan for the CEO and other executive officers; and • evaluating the Board’s and its committees’ structure, processes and performance. Board Meetings Our Board held a total of eleven meetings during 2023. Each of our incumbent directors attended more than 75% of the total meetings of the Board and the Board committees on which they served during 2023; average attendance was 92%. We strongly encourage, but do not require, directors to participate in our annual meetings of stockholders. Ten of the eleven directors who were nominated for election at our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders participated in that meeting. Director Attendance 2023 Average Regular Executive Session Our independent directors meet in executive session, outside the presence of management, at each regularly scheduled quarterly Board meeting and committee meeting, and at other times as necessary or desirable. The Lead Independent Director chairs all regularly scheduled executive sessions of the Board and all other meetings of the independent directors. Risk Management Management has primary responsibility for identifying and managing our exposure to risk, subject to active oversight by our Board of the processes we establish to assess, monitor and mitigate that exposure. The Board, directly and through its committees, routinely discusses our significant enterprise risks with management and reviews the guidelines, policies and procedures we have in place to manage those risks. At Board and committee meetings, directors engage in analyses and dialogue regarding specific areas of risk, including our enterprise risk management process. These discussions enable our Board to focus on the strategic, financial, operational, legal, regulatory and other risks that we believe are most significant to us and our business and ensures that our enterprise risks are well understood, mitigated to the extent reasonable and consistent with the Board’s view of our risk profile and risk tolerance. As part of management’s enterprise risk management process, management briefs the Audit and Compliance Committee on information security and cybersecurity risks and our programs to manage those risks at least annually. Management identifies and assesses information security risks using industry practices aligned to recommendations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and engages independent security firms to 2024 | Proxy Statement 33 Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters conduct periodic penetration tests in order to identify and remediate vulnerabilities. The Company has not experienced any material information security breaches in the last three years and, as such, has not incurred any expenses related to information security breaches in the last three years. Additional information regarding the Company's approach to cybersecurity can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company believes it is adequately insured against losses related to a potential information security breach. In addition to the overall risk oversight function administered directly by our Board, each of our Audit and Compliance, Compensation, Investment and Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committees exercises its own oversight related to the risks associated with their particular responsibilities: Audit and Compliance Committee • Reviews financial, accounting, public reporting and internal control risks and the mechanisms through which we assess and manage risk • Discusses with management the Company’s major financial risk exposures and steps taken to monitor and control such exposures, including the Company’s risk assessment and risk management processes • Reviews the Company’s information security, cybersecurity and ethics and compliance risks • Reviews conflict of interest, related party and other similar matters and oversees risks associated with such matters Compensation Committee • Evaluates whether our compensation policies and practices, as they relate to both executive officers and employees generally, encourage excessive risk-taking • Reviews risks and associated risk management activities related to human capital management Investment Committee • Oversees certain transaction-related risks, including the review of transactions in excess of certain thresholds Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee • Reviews risks related to corporate governance, Board effectiveness and succession planning • Evaluates risks associated with non-executive director independence, when applicable The chair of each committee reports to the full Board at each regularly scheduled Board meeting and other times as appropriate, including regarding risk matters considered by the committee. Our Board believes that this division of responsibilities is the most effective approach for identifying and addressing risk. Through Ms. Cafaro’s combined role as CEO and Chairman, our Board leadership structure appropriately supports the Board’s role in risk oversight by facilitating prompt attention by the Board and its committees to the significant enterprise risks identified by management in our day-to-day operations. Human Capital Risk Management The Compensation Committee oversees certain human capital matters, including select DE&I efforts and goals. We report on human capital matters at each regularly scheduled meeting of our Compensation Committee and at least annually to the Board. The most significant human capital measures and objectives that we focus on include talent attraction and retention and development, culture, DE&I and health, safety and wellness. 34 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Compensation Risk Assessment As part of its risk oversight role, our Compensation Committee annually considers, together with its independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy, whether our compensation policies and practices for all employees, including our executive officers, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our Company. In conducting its risk assessment, the Compensation Committee reviewed a report prepared by management regarding our existing compensation plans and programs, in the context of our business risk environment. In its review, the Compensation Committee noted several design features of our compensation programs that reduce the likelihood of excessive risk-taking, including the following: • review and approval by the Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors (and in the case of the CEO, the independent members of the Board) of the compensation structure, plan and awards for our executive officers and the aggregate value of awards for other employees; • advice of an independent compensation consultant on executive compensation levels and program design; • regular review of comparative compensation data to maintain competitive compensation levels in light of our industry, size and performance; • a balanced mix of compensation with a strong emphasis on variable compensation and long-term equity awards; • incentive award opportunities that (i) do not provide minimum guaranteed payouts, (ii) have capped payouts and (iii) are based on a range of performance outcomes; • equity compensation—in the form of Performance Stock Units or Restricted Stock Units—awards that provide strong incentive to create and preserve long-term stockholder value and discourage excessive risk-taking; • performance measures used for incentives that are based on our business strategy and often in tension with each other in order to balance risk, such as goals to promote FFO growth and maintain a strong balance sheet; • longer-term time-based awards that further align management to stockholder interests and discourage excessive risk-taking in pursuit of shorter-term financial objectives; • equity incentive awards granted for future performance with multi-year vesting schedules/performance periods to enhance retention, discourage excessive risk-taking in pursuit of shorter-term financial objectives and further align executive and stockholder interests; and • other policies, such as executive stock ownership guidelines, our recoupment policy and prohibition on hedging and pledging activities that further align executive and stockholder interests. Based on its evaluation, the Compensation Committee has determined, in its reasonable business judgment, that our compensation practices and policies for all employees do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our Company and instead promote behaviors that support long-term sustainability and stockholder value. Management Succession Planning The Nominating, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee leads, and the Board oversees and reviews at least annually, a robust short- and long-term succession planning process for our senior management team, including our CEO. In assessing possible CEO candidates, our independent directors identify the skills, experience and attributes they believe are required to be an effective leader in light of the Company’s strategic plan, business opportunities and challenges. The Board employs a similar approach with respect to evaluating possible candidates for other senior management positions. In general, the Board’s management succession planning is designed to anticipate both “planned” successions, such as those arising from anticipated retirements, and unplanned succession events, including emergencies and a range of other potential contingencies. Our Board has adopted an emergency succession plan to facilitate the transition to both interim and long-term leadership in the event of an unexpected vacancy in the position of CEO. The CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer support the annual succession plan review conducted by the Nominating, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee by providing information about each executive role and succession scenarios, including an overview of each potential successor’s experience and potential, readiness assessment and planned leadership development opportunities. The independent members of the Board also regularly interact with executives across several leadership levels of Ventas through management presentations at the Board meetings and other informal events to form their own independent assessment of senior leaders. Both the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Board also regularly review strength and gaps in the executive and senior management team and their organizations with the Company’s long-term strategy and goal of optimizing performance in mind. When appropriate, action plans are identified and executed to drive performance, enhance organizational resilience and support succession planning, including for the CEO. We engage third party experts where appropriate to bring additional insights to, and facilitate, succession planning, conduct assessments and provide coaching and development to executives and others in cases where the Company and the employee will benefit. 2024 | Proxy Statement 35 Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Committee Information Committee Overview Audit and Compliance Committee M M C M 4 Compensation Committee C M M M 5 Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee C M M M 5 Investment Committee M C M M M 2 * Independent director M Member Lead independent director C Chair Information in the table above reflects our committee meetings and Board composition as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Our Guidelines specify a rigorous annual evaluation process to determine whether to rotate a committee chair after a director’s service as a particular committee chair approximates five years. This evaluation process is conducted on a holistic basis and a chair’s years of service on a committee is a single factor in the analysis rather than a sole determinant as to whether a committee’s leadership position should be rotated. Committee chair rotations may occur sooner or later than after a director has reached five years of service as a committee chair. Committee Charters Our Audit and Compliance Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and Investment Committee each operates under a written charter that is available under "Governance" in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at www.ventasreit.com . We also provide copies of these charters, without charge, upon request to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at 353 North Clark Street, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois 60654 . 38 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Stockholder Engagement Our Board and senior management value frequent and regular engagement with our stockholders to promote transparency, improve our understanding of stockholder perspectives and increase the Board’s accountability to stockholders.

Non-Employee Director Compensation Structure of Directors’ Compensation Our Board believes that the compensation paid to our non-employee directors should (i) be competitive with the S&P 500 and our Compensation Peer Group, consisting of publicly traded REITs with similar enterprise values and total assets, as further described in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Procedures for Determining Compensation—Executive Compensation Decision-Making Process” and (ii) enable us to attract and retain individuals of the highest quality to serve as our directors. In addition, the Board believes that a significant portion of non-employee director compensation should align director interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, non-employee directors receive a combination of cash and equity-based compensation for their services. Each of these components is described below. We also reimburse each non-employee director for travel and other expenses associated with attending Board and committee meetings, director education programs and other Board-related activities. Ms. Cafaro, the only member of the Board employed by us, does not receive compensation for her service as a director. 2024 | Proxy Statement 41 Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Components of Directors’ Compensation The majority of our Non-Employee Directors’ Compensation is in the form of annual restricted stock unit grants that are typically awarded immediately following our annual meeting and vest on the earlier of (i) the one-year anniversary of the grant date and (ii) the date of the next annual meeting.

Roberts, 53 Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Ethics & Compliance Officer 46 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation Proposal 2 Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers At the 2024 Annual Meeting, we are asking you to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s Named Executive Officers. Our Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation program achieves our objectives of retaining and motivating talented executives and rewarding superior performance while discouraging excessive risk-taking. The program supports a performance- and achievement-oriented environment that is geared toward delivering long-term stockholder value. Accordingly, our Board recommends that stockholders vote in favor of the following resolution: “RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure.” Although the results of the stockholder vote on this proposal are non-binding, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when making future executive compensation decisions. The Company currently provides an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on this topic every year; accordingly, the next opportunity to vote will occur in connection with the Company’s 2025 Annual Meeting. Our Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. 2024 | Proxy Statement 47 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“CD&A”) summarizes our executive compensation philosophy, objectives and programs, the compensation decisions made under those programs and the factors considered by our Compensation Committee in making those decisions. Background Ventas Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) focused on delivering strong, sustainable stockholder returns by enabling exceptional environments that benefit a large and growing aging population. The Company’s growth is fueled by its senior housing communities, which provide valuable services to residents and enable them to thrive in supported environments. Ventas leverages its unmatched operational expertise, data-driven insights from its Ventas Operational Insights TM platform, extensive relationships and strong financial position to achieve its goal of delivering outsized performance across approximately 1,400 properties. The Ventas portfolio is composed of senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, hospitals and healthcare facilities located in North America and the United Kingdom. Our results are reported in three business segments—senior housing operating portfolio (“SHOP”), outpatient medical and research portfolio (“OM&R”) and triple-net leased properties (“NNN”). We aim to enhance stockholder value by delivering consistent, superior total returns through a strategy of (1) delivering profitable organic growth in senior housing fueled by growing demographic demand, (2) capturing value-creating external growth focused on senior housing, (3) driving strong execution and cash flow generation throughout our portfolio of high quality assets unified in serving the large and growing aging population and (4) maintaining financial strength, flexibility and liquidity and we assess the performance of our executives against measures designed to support this strategy. In 2023, we delivered Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders of $(0.10) per share, Nareit Funds from Operations* ("FFO") of $3.26 per share and Normalized FFO* of $2.99 per share, which exceeded the midpoint Normalized FFO per share guidance provided in February 2023 and represented growth of more than 5% (1) over the prior year. We also delivered SHOP, NNN and OM&R NOI growth of 10%, 4% and 6%, respectively over the prior year. *    Some of the financial measures discussed, including certain performance measures, are non-GAAP measures. Please see Appendix A for additional information and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. (1) Excluding a $53 million ($0.13 per share) benefit from HHS grants received in 2022 and a $9 million ($0.02 per share) benefit of promote revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 within the Company’s institutional capital management business. 48 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation Executive Summary We delivered strong results in 2023. Our advantaged platform has the team, tools, financial strength, data capabilities and operator relationships to drive performance, as evidenced by our strong financial results in 2023. We delivered Total Stockholder Return ("TSR") of over 15%, outperforming both the FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index and the MSCI U.S. REIT Index. We delivered Normalized FFO* of $2.99 per share, which exceeded the midpoint Normalized FFO per share guidance provided in February 2023 and represented growth of more than 5% (1) over the prior year. Our results were fueled by unprecedented organic property growth in our senior housing operating portfolio, supported by compounding contributions from our outpatient medical and research and triple-net lease portfolios. Our asset classes continue to benefit from demographic demand and we entered 2024 with momentum that we believe will create significant stockholder value. Our executive compensation program supports long-term value creation. More than 90% of our CEO compensation and more than 80% of the compensation for our other Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is variable and at risk, tied to our stock price performance or subject to achievement of pre-set rigorous performance targets that are important to stockholder value creation. Our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs are aligned to stockholder returns and financial performance results, as demonstrated by the payouts under those programs. Our 2023 annual incentive plan paid out at 109%-125% of target, driven by three measures that are important to our investors — Normalized FFO per share, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and General & Administrative Management and Expense Controls. In our long-term incentive program, performance share unit ("PSU") Awards earned for the 2021-2023 performance period were slightly above target, consistent with our relative TSR performance over that same period. Our 2023 incentive programs reflect affirmative steps undertaken by the Compensation Committee in response to stockholder feedback. For our 2023 annual incentive plan, we: • Returned to our pre-pandemic practice of establishing full-year goals for all performance measures, • Increased the weighting of the corporate performance measures to 75% in 2023 from 60% in 2022 — above the 65% allocation in our pre-pandemic program design, and • Simplified the corporate performance measures by reducing the number of measures from four to three, all of which are financial and quantitative and more consistent with those used in our 2022 and pre-pandemic annual incentive plans. We have included in this Proxy Statement enhanced disclosure of the DE&I metrics included in our 2021-2023, 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 PSU awards. We continued to listen to our stockholders and made further adjustments to our long-term incentive plan in our 2024 executive compensation program. During our Fall 2023 stockholder engagement program, we received feedback that the performance measures in our long-term incentive program should be limited to financial measures. In response, we transitioned goals related to our DE&I initiatives from our long-term incentive program to be part of the individual performance component of the 2024 annual incentive plan, consistent with our continued commitment to these values. 2023 PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS > 15% 2023 Total Shareholder Return $2.99 Normalized FFO* Per Share (> 5% (1) ) > 8% Same-Store Cash NOI Growth >18% SHOP Same-Store Cash NOI Growth • $4B+ Capital Raised $3B+ Year-End Liquidity *    Some of the financial measures discussed, including certain performance measures, are non-GAAP measures.

Justin Hutchens, Executive Vice President ("EVP"), Senior Housing, to the additional role of Chief Investment Officer in January 2023. In his expanded role, Mr. Hutchens is responsible for our capital allocation strategy and execution across the enterprise in addition to his responsibility for our senior housing portfolio. By combining the Chief Investment Officer and EVP, Senior Housing roles, we streamlined our executive management structure and enhanced the connection between investment activity and business operations. Named Executive Officers Our 2023 Named Executive Officers were: Name Title Debra A. Cafaro Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert F. Probst Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Peter J. Bulgarelli Executive Vice President, Outpatient Medical & Research, Ventas, Inc. President and CEO, Lillibridge Healthcare Services, Inc. (1) J. Justin Hutchens Executive Vice President, Senior Housing and Chief Investment Officer Carey S. Roberts Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Ethics & Compliance Officer (1) Lillibridge Healthcare Services, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Updates to Executive Compensation Program for 2023 In the fall of 2022 and early 2023, with input from its independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy, the Compensation Committee conducted an annual review of executive compensation that considered, among other factors, changes in the roles of certain of the executive officers, peer benchmarking data and stockholder perspectives. In particular, the Compensation Committee considered that Mr. Hutchens was appointed to the additional role of Chief Investment Officer on January 23, 2023. Based on this review, for 2023: • there were no changes to Ms. Cafaro’s base salary, annual incentive opportunity or long-term incentive opportunity • base salaries for Mr. Probst, Mr. Bulgarelli and Ms. Roberts were increased by 2%, 4% and 2% respectively • reflecting the increased scope of his responsibilities, Mr. Hutchens’ base salary was increased by 8.9%, his target annual incentive was increased from 150% to 175% of his base salary and his target long-term incentive was increased from 350% to 414% of his base salary • annual plan performance measures were rebalanced, placing a heavier emphasis on Normalized FFO/Share, replacing the SHOP NOI growth measure, which is effectively captured in the Normalized FFO/Share measure, with a G&A Management and Expense Controls measure and reducing the weight allocated to individual performance. As a result of these changes, 75% of 2023 annual incentive awards was based on achievement of the following three corporate financial and quantitative performance measures, with the remaining 25% based on individual performance: (1) • Normalized FFO/Share (45%), • Fixed Charge Coverage (20%) and • G&A Management and Expense Controls (10%) • We made a modest adjustment to the weightings for our CEO's 2023-2025 PSU Awards; as a result, 2023-2025 PSU Awards for all of our Named Executive Officers measure achievement against four measures: • TSR relative to MSCI U.S. REIT Index (25%), • TSR relative to FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index (38%), • Net Debt to Further Adjusted EBITDA (20%) and • Measurable Improvement in Key DE&I Metrics (17%) (1) The annual incentive plan for the Outpatient Medical and Research Executive Vice President includes measures and goals specific to the outpatient medical & research ("OM&R", formerly Office) business. In 2023, 40% of the opportunity was allocated to corporate measures as described in the table above, 35% was allocated to measures and goals specific to the OM&R segment and 25% was allocated to individual objectives & performance, consistent with our other Executive Officers. Please see “—2023 Executive Compensation—Annual Incentive Compensation—2023 Annual Incentive Performance Measures and Results” for further information. 2024 | Proxy Statement 51 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Stockholder Engagement We have a longstanding practice of engaging with our stockholders and taking actions that reflect perspectives and preferences that stockholders share with us through regular and direct dialogue. Our Board has led our stockholder outreach program for over a decade, engaging directly with our stockholders at least twice a year on executive compensation, corporate governance and other topics of interest to them. At our 2023 Annual Meeting, the advisory say-on-pay-proposal received over 90% support of votes cast, including abstentions. While we were pleased to see this level of support, we continued to engage with our stockholders regarding our executive compensation program. In our engagement, our stockholders expressed support for the changes we had made to our 2023 executive compensation program. However, we also heard feedback that the PSU Awards included in our long-term incentive program should be limited to financial measures. In response to this feedback, we have removed the DE&I metrics from our PSU Awards for the 2024-2026 cycle. Consistent with our continued commitment to these values, we have included goals related to our DE&I initiatives in an ESG Scorecard that is a component of our 2024 annual incentive plan. We believe the actions we have taken during 2022 and 2023 demonstrate the value we place on the perspective of our stockholders and our desire to ensure that our executive compensation program is aligned with stockholder expectations. Executive Compensation Philosophy We recognize that effective compensation strategies are critical to recruiting, incentivizing and retaining key employees who contribute to our long-term success and thereby create value for our stockholders. Accordingly, our compensation program is designed to achieve the following primary objectives: • attract, retain and motivate talented executives; • focus executives on accomplishing company and individual goals that support our strategic objectives; • employ a pay for performance structure that aligns with the creation of long-term stockholder value; • provide balanced incentives that discourage excessive risk-taking; and • support our goal to deliver sustained, superior returns to stockholders. We align the interests of our executive officers and stockholders by maintaining a performance- and achievement-oriented program that provides executives with the opportunity to earn market-competitive levels of cash and equity compensation for strong performance against key strategic, financial and operating goals that create long-term stockholder value. In determining the design and scope of our executive compensation program, we also consider the perspectives that our stockholders share with us, including through our proactive Board-led stockholder outreach program and our annual say- on-pay advisory vote at our annual stockholders’ meetings. Certain of our decisions regarding our 2023 and 2024 executive compensation program reflect that feedback, including the results of the 2022 and 2023 say-on-pay votes. 52 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation Our Compensation Structure Consistent with our compensation philosophy, over 90% of our CEO’s pay and over 80% of the pay of our other Named Executive Officers is variable and at risk. Further, a significant portion of our incentive pay is dependent on achieving pre- established performance measures. CEO Total Direct Compensation Other NEOs Total Direct Compensation n Base Salary n Annual Cash Incentive Compensation n Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation n Base Salary n Annual Cash Incentive Compensation n Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation The objectives of our program are as follows: Base Salary Base Salary compensates our executives for the knowledge, skill and expertise they bring to our Company on a day-to-day basis. Base salaries are generally targeted to approximate the median of the Compensation Peer Group (1) , but may deviate from this target based on an individual’s sustained performance, contributions, leadership, experience, expertise and scope of responsibilities within our Company as compared to the benchmark data. Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Annual Cash Incentive Compensation rewards our executives for achieving pre-determined corporate and individual goals established for the fiscal year. These goals typically represent milestones we have determined need to be met within a given year to advance our annual and long-term objectives. Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation rewards our executives for performance that supports our long-term strategy and growth. This compensation consists of (i) Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) that generally vest over three years and (ii) Performance Share Units (“PSUs”) that vest at the end of a three-year period, subject to achieving performance measures established at the beginning of that performance period. (1) The Compensation Peer Group are the companies we use to benchmark our Executive Compensation, as more fully discussed below. 2024 | Proxy Statement 53 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Performance Measures and How They Are Linked to Our Strategy Performance measures for our annual and long-term incentive plans are designed to encourage our executives to focus on initiatives that will further the Company’s annual and long-term strategic priorities and objectives. Annual measures typically relate to items that can be completed within one year or are appropriately considered on a year-over-year basis, but we may also establish annual measures linked to longer term objectives to emphasize the importance of a particular element of our strategy or incentivize completion of a preliminary step. Long-term performance measures typically relate to items that are most appropriately assessed over a period of several years. The Compensation Committee reviews the annual and long-term incentive program design annually. Set forth below are timelines that show the performance measures used in our recently completed annual and long-term incentive plans, as well as the measures used in our incentive plans for which the performance periods are not yet complete: the 2024 annual incentive plan and the 2022-2024, 2023-2025 and 2024-2026 PSU awards.

Use of DE&I Metrics in our Long-Term Incentive Plan We have a long history of actively promoting diversity, equity & inclusion ("DE&I") in our company, our industry and our communities, which we believe supports the creation of long-term stockholder value. Research shows that diverse groups achieve better outcomes. Our DE&I efforts have focused on goals and initiatives that would have the greatest impact on our company, our industry and our communities and contribute to sustainable long-term outperformance. In 2020, to accelerate our efforts, we developed a customized, comprehensive DE&I framework organized around the pillars of people, culture, investment and ‘Beyond Ventas.’ We formed a DE&I Committee headed by our Chairman & CEO to put our DE&I framework into action, engaging a diverse, multi-disciplinary group of employees across our organization in the effort. To reinforce our seriousness of purpose, we incorporated DE&I metrics in our 2021-2023, 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 PSU Awards that were designed to measure progress on our DE&I initiatives. The key DE&I metrics for each performance period were selected following review by the Compensation Committee of our DE&I framework and underlying initiatives and identification of metrics that are either foundational to making progress toward our DE&I goals or demonstrate that our DE&I initiatives are having the desired effect. 2024 | Proxy Statement 55 Table of Contents Executive Compensation The key DE&I metrics, quantitative goals and achievement for the 2021-2023 PSU awards are set forth in the 2023 Executive Compensation discussion under the heading 2021-2023 PSU Performance and Payouts. The key DE&I metrics for the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 PSU awards are generally consistent with the metrics for the 2021-2023 PSU Awards. The Company expects to disclose the specific metrics and quantitative goals for the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 PSU Awards following completion of those performance periods. During our Fall 2023 stockholder engagement program, we received feedback that our long-term incentive program performance measures should be limited to financial measures. Based on these comments, we have removed the DE&I metrics from our PSU Awards for the 2024-2026 cycle. Consistent with our continued commitment to these values, we have included goals related to our DE&I initiatives in an ESG Scorecard that is a component of our 2024 annual incentive plan. Procedures for Determining Compensation Executive Compensation Decision-Making Process The Company is committed to a competitive compensation structure that allows us to attract, retain and motivate our key executives while creating alignment with long-term stockholder value. We review executive compensation regularly to ensure that our compensation programs align with this philosophy. As part of this process, we engage in extensive benchmarking with the assistance of our independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy. We also maintain an ongoing dialogue with our stockholders to solicit their perspectives on our executive compensation program. Each year, the Compensation Committee: 01 Reviews benchmarking data regarding our executive compensation program provided by our independent compensation consultant 06 Reviews the performance measures and goals proposed by Management 07 Considers whether the proposed performance measures and goals support the Company's strategic objectives and are appropriately rigorous 02 Considers recommendations from our independent compensation consultant regarding adjustments to our compensation structure 05 Determines whether any changes to the executive compensation structure are warranted 08 Provides a recommendation to the Board of Directors regarding the CEO compensation structure and performance measures and goals 03 Considers the performance of the executive team and the Company 04 Considers other relevant factors, such as competition for talent and stockholder feedback 09 Approves the compensation structure and performance measures and goals for our other executive officers Benchmarking and Compensation Peer Group For benchmarking purposes, our independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy, provides our Compensation Committee with comparative market data on compensation practices and programs of our peer companies (the “Compensation Peer Group”) and provides guidance on compensation trends and best practices. Using this market data, Semler Brossy advises the Compensation Committee and makes recommendations with respect to program design and setting base salaries and incentive award opportunity levels for our Named Executive Officers. 56 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation 2023 Compensation Peer Group Positioning The Compensation Committee reviews the Compensation Peer Group each summer to ensure the Company is using an appropriate group for pay level and pay practice comparisons. The Compensation Peer Group generally consists of large- cap REITs in our healthcare sector or large-cap REITS in other sectors (such as office, retail and lodging) that are similar to us in other ways, such as total assets, revenue and enterprise value. The chart below shows our positioning relative to our 2023 Compensation Peer Group as of June 15, 2022. 25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile Total Assets ($M) Trailing 4Q Revenue ($M) Enterprise Value ($M) The Compensation Committee reviewed the Compensation Peer Group in July 2022 and added Medical Properties Trust, a healthcare REIT and direct competitor, to the Compensation Peer Group for purposes of setting 2023 compensation. 2023 Compensation Peer Group American Tower Corp.

(WELL) Healthpeak Properties, Inc. (DOC) Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY) Medical Properties Trust (MPW) In determining 2023 compensation targets for our Named Executive Officers, our Compensation Committee, in consultation with Semler Brossy, considered the competitive positioning of our executive compensation levels relative to compensation data for the 2023 Compensation Peer Group with respect to the following pay components: base salary; total annual compensation opportunity (base salary plus annual incentive awards); long-term equity incentives (annualized target value of long-term equity incentive awards); and total direct compensation (base salary plus annual incentive awards and annualized target value of long-term equity incentive awards). This assessment included a review of awarded pay, pay realized in recent years and projections regarding realized pay in future years. The Compensation Committee also considered the low level of support for our executive compensation indicated in the 2022 say-on-pay vote and concerns expressed by our stockholders in discussions throughout 2022. Consistent with our compensation philosophy, our Compensation Committee reviewed each element of pay in the context of the Compensation Peer Group. The Compensation Committee does not target a specific percentile of market when making pay decisions, but rather determines overall total target direct compensation relative to the Compensation Peer Group based on the unique skills, expertise and individual contributions of each Named Executive Officer. Our 2023 executive compensation program was designed to deliver compensation levels at, above or below these targets if performance met, exceeded or failed to achieve the goals established for the annual and long-term incentive awards. 2024 | Proxy Statement 57 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Compensation Policies and Practices—Good Governance THINGS WE DO Include a balanced mix of cash and equity compensation, with a strong emphasis on performance-based incentive awards Use a blend of measures designed to promote responsible growth and risk management Emphasize performance-based equity incentives to foster alignment with long-term stockholder interests Cap incentive award opportunities Measure performance over a three-year period for long-term incentive awards Exercise negative discretion to reduce incentive award payouts when appropriate Conduct annual risk assessment of all compensation programs Maintain meaningful stock ownership guidelines of 6X for CEO and 3X for all other executive officers Maintain a recoupment policy for all incentive compensation Prohibit hedging or pledging of Company stock Use double-trigger change-in-control provisions 2023 Executive Compensation 2023 Base Salary Our Compensation Committee reviews the base salaries of our executive officers annually to determine whether any adjustments are warranted. In January 2023, the Compensation Committee reviewed benchmarking data and a realized pay analysis provided by its independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy. Based on that review and on the decision to promote Mr. Hutchens to Chief Investment Officer, giving him additional duties, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors approved increases of 2% in the 2023 base salaries of Mr. Probst and Ms. Roberts, 4% in the 2023 base salary of Mr. Bulgarelli and 8.9% in the base salary of Mr. Hutchens.

In establishing the performance measures and goals, the Compensation Committee considers the Company’s strategic priorities and the specific challenges and opportunities facing the Company at the time. Annual performance measures and goals are designed to incentivize our executive officers to address the near-term priorities that are necessary to implement our strategy without taking inappropriate risk. The annual program typically measures performance over the full fiscal year, and the Compensation Committee generally approves specific performance measures, goals and weightings and an award opportunity range (expressed as multiples of base salary at each applicable level of performance) early in the year for each executive officer. For 2023, full-year financial and individual performance metrics were assigned 75% and 25% weighting respectively. 2023 Annual Incentive Award Opportunities The award opportunity under our annual incentive plan is tied to each executive officer’s base salary in effect at the time of grant. The 2023 annual incentive award opportunity for each of our Named Executive Officers is set forth in the table below; there were no increases, as a percentage of base salary, from the 2022 annual incentive award opportunities for Mr. Probst, Mr. Bulgarelli or Ms. Roberts. Mr. Hutchens' annual incentive opportunity was increased in recognition of his increased responsibilities. There is no payout for performance that falls below threshold and no increase above the maximum payout for performance above maximum.

Because the range of potential payouts is broader for some executives than for others, the level of achievement is scored on a 100-point scale, with achievement at target equal to 50. For example, performance half-way between target and maximum would generate an achievement score of 75, and would result in a payout equal to 140% of target for Ms. Cafaro and 117% of target for Mr. Bulgarelli. 2024 | Proxy Statement 59 Table of Contents Executive Compensation 2023 Corporate Measures and Results* Achievement: 71 75% of award out of a possible 100 Goals and Achievement Measure Weighting Threshold (0% payout if below) Target (50% payout) Max (100% payout) Achievement Normalized FFO/Share 58 Why this measure was chosen: FFO is a common measure of operating performance for REITs because it excludes, among other items, the effect of gains and losses from real estate sales and real estate depreciation and amortization. Normalized FFO also is a common measure of operating performance among REITs and is the main measure the Company uses in its publicly reported earnings results and discussions with investors; it also is modeled by analysts in determining consensus estimates. Normalized FFO is defined as FFO excluding certain items, such as non-cash income tax items and transaction expenses, and provides a more accurate comparison of operating performance over time. A REIT's Normalized FFO per share can have a significant impact on the trading price of its common stock and, therefore, its TSR. Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (1) 100 Why this measure was chosen: Fixed Charge Coverage ratio is an important measure for assessing the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt obligations and continue to pay or increase our dividend. A strong ratio of EBITDA-generation compared to fixed payment obligations—one element of our comprehensive risk management program—is especially important for REITs, which are dividend-paying and required to distribute to stockholders a substantial portion of their annual taxable net income. General & Administrative ("G&A") Management & Expense Controls (2) 67 Why this measure was chosen: G&A Management & Expense Controls emphasizes the importance of disciplined expense controls to the delivery of stockholder value, and our focus on operating efficiently as our organization grows and evolves. This discipline is important in any environment but particularly in an inflationary environment where labor and other expenses are increasing. Managing G&A expense also supports appropriate resource allocation for our strategy and our budgeting and forecasting processes and enables us to deliver on our commitments to stockholders. (1) Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio determined based on trailing twelve months, as reported, as of December 31, 2023. (2) General & Administrative expense as reported. *    Certain of our financial performance measures are non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding non-GAAP performance measures, please see Appendix A. 60 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation Individual Performance 25% of Award The individual performance component of our annual incentive plan takes the form of tailored individual measures and objectives, which are typically established in March. The individual measures and objectives for our Named Executive Officers for 2023 generally fell into the following categories: • Financial and Operating Performance • Strategic Projects and Initiatives • Risk Management • Organizational Strength, Culture & Values The Compensation Committee assessed performance of each of our Named Executive Officers against the pre-established individual performance measures and objectives during meetings throughout the year and following the completion of fiscal 2023. The Committee considered the following in assessing individual performance: • We delivered strong Financial and Operating Performance, demonstrated by robust TSR of over 15% in 2023, outperforming both the FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index and the MSCI U.S. REIT index. We delivered Normalized FFO/Share* of $2.99, exceeding the midpoint Normalized FFO per share guidance provided in February 2023 and representing growth of more than 5% (1) over the prior year. Total company same-store cash NOI* grew 8.1%. We continued to drive outstanding performance in SHOP, with same-store cash NOI* growth of 18.3%, while our OM&R and NNN same-store cash NOI* grew 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively. • We made significant progress on our Strategic Projects and Initiatives, including by continuing to leverage and expand the Ventas OI TM platform to strengthen our relationships with, and the success of, our operators, refreshing our brand and improving our internal systems and processes. • We Managed Risk by leveraging our access to a wide array of capital markets to raise over $4 billion ahead of rising interest rates while maintaining our BBB+ credit rating (2) and preserving robust liquidity of over $3 billion. • We improved our Organizational Strength, Culture & Values in various ways. We enhanced the connection between the Company’s investment activity and business operations. We increased employee engagement through enhanced training and development opportunities, communications and hybrid flexible work arrangements. In furtherance of our net-zero goals, we rolled out decarbonization roadmaps for approximately 800 buildings and referenced them for 2024 capital expenditure planning; we also saw three on-site solar projects approved at Atria facilities in California. We successfully executed on our 2023 DE&I initiatives, leading to recognition as the Gold Award Winner in Nareit's Diversity, Equity & Inclusion awards for the fourth consecutive year. Based on this assessment, the Committee next considered the individual contributions made by the Named Executive Officers in support of these achievements. Set forth below are summaries of key achievements of our Named Executive Officers during 2023 that informed the Compensation Committee’s assessment of their individual performance. As with the corporate metrics, achievement is scored on a 100-point scale, with performance at target equal to 50 and performance at or above maximum equal to 100. (1) Excluding a $53 million ($0.13 per share) benefit from HHS grants received in 2022 and a $9 million ($0.02 per share) benefit of promote revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 within the Company's institutional capital management business. (2) BBB+ (stable) rating from Standard & Poor’s; Baa1 (stable) rating from Moody’s. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. *    Some of the financial measures discussed are non-GAAP financial measures.

Our equity compensation program has two components: PSUs that vest in three years based on performance achieved relative to approved performance measures and RSUs that vest in three equal annual installments. These awards encourage management to create and sustain long-term stockholder value because their value is directly attributable to changes in the price of our common stock over time. In addition, equity awards promote management retention because their full value cannot be realized until vesting occurs, which generally requires continued employment for multiple years. The chart below shows the percentage of our 2023 long-term equity incentive compensation that is in the form of RSUs and the percentage of long-term equity incentive compensation attributable to each measure that will be used to measure performance under the 2023-2025 PSU awards. 2023 Long-Term Equity Plan Design CEO 2023 Plan Design Other NEO 2023 Plan Design Time-Based Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) Performance-Based Stock Units (PSUs) 38% TSR Relative to the FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index 25% TSR Relative to the MSCI U.S REIT Index 20% Balance Sheet (Net Debt: EBITDA) 17% Measurable Improvements in Key DE&I Metrics 2024 | Proxy Statement 67 Table of Contents Executive Compensation 2023 Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation In the first quarter of 2023, each of our Named Executive Officers was granted long-term equity awards delivered in the form of RSUs that vest ratably over three years and PSUs that will be distributed in the first quarter of 2026 if performance goals for the 2023-2025 performance period are achieved. The 2023 target opportunities, as a percentage of base salaries, were unchanged for Ms. Cafaro, Mr. Probst and Mr. Bulgarelli. Based on the annual benchmarking report, the target opportunity for Ms. Roberts was increased from 325% to 350% of base salary and the target opportunity for Mr. Hutchens was increased from 350% to 414%, reflecting his assumption of additional duties at the beginning of 2023. The target values of the 2022 and 2023 long-term equity awards at the grant date were as follows: 2022 2023 Named Executive Officer Total Long-Term Equity Target Value (1) ($) RSUs ($) Target PSUs ($) Total Long- Term Equity Target Value (1) ($) RSUs ($) Target PSUs ($) Debra A.

RSU Awards Annual grants of RSU awards are an important component of the Company’s executive compensation program. Through these awards, a percentage of each executive officer’s pay is directly linked to our stock price. As a component of our 2023 long-term equity compensation, in January 2023, the Company granted RSUs to each of our Named Executive Officers that vest in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Vesting of these awards is generally subject to the Named Executive Officer’s continued employment with the Company on each vesting date, as these awards are intended to enhance retention of our Named Executive Officers. Dividends are paid on RSU awards as and when dividends are paid to all of our stockholders. The grants to each of our Named Executive Officers during 2023 are set forth in the table below. Named Executive Officer RSUs (#) Debra A. Cafaro 51,933 Robert F. Probst 21,970 Peter J. Bulgarelli 15,852 J. Justin Hutchens 19,601 Carey S. Roberts 15,169 68 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation PSU Awards 2023-2025 PSU Measures and Goals PSUs may be earned, if at all, based on the Company’s three-year performance from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025 in relation to four performance measures. Sixty-three percent of the 2023 PSU value for our Named Executive Officers is tied to rigorous relative TSR measures, while the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio measure represents 20% and our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measure represents 17% of the 2023 PSU award value for each of our Named Executive Officers. Performance Measure Weighting (% of total PSU opportunity) Goals Threshold Target Maximum Why we use this measure TSR Relative to the FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index (from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025) The FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index is comprised of all healthcare REITs. Because a significant portion of our business is in healthcare, this is an appropriate index against which we should compare our long-term TSR. TSR Relative to the MSCI U.S. REIT Index (from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025) The MSCI U.S. REIT Index is comprised of small-, mid- and large- cap REITs across a diverse set of industries and therefore represents an appropriate index against which we should compare our long- term TSR performance. Net Debt to EBITDA (1) ** ** ** Reported Net Debt to Further Adjusted EBITDA reflects the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt obligations. Measurable Improvement in Key DE&I Metrics (1) ** ** ** This measure serves to track our effectiveness in pursuing our DE&I initiatives, which we believe support the creation of long-term stockholder value. (1) Our Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion goals not disclosed because they are (i) not material and (ii) competitively sensitive. Our Compensation Committee sets goals for the long-term PSUs based on our strategy and long-term objectives. For our TSR measures, the Compensation Committee established a band that provides a market-based spread of performance across potential performance scenarios in line with our peer companies. Our Net Debt to EBITDA goal is set at a level designed to ensure that we have access to and a cost of capital that allows us to be opportunistic and provides a margin of safety that protects our stockholders. Achievement on our measure related to key DE&I metrics will be determined based on performance relative to goals established to measure progress on our DE&I initiatives, including increasing the representation of women and minorities in senior leadership and manager and above positions, respectively, continued engagement of minority and women owned businesses to meet our supply and service needs, improvement in our internal DE&I survey response rate and improvement in DE&I survey results as compared to an industry benchmark. There will be no payouts on any measure for performance below threshold and payouts will not be increased for performance above maximum. 2024 | Proxy Statement 69 Table of Contents Executive Compensation 2023-2025 PSU Opportunities The range of potential PSU payouts is 0% - 201% of target for Ms. Cafaro and 0% - 180% of target for the other Named Executive Officers.

There will be no payment for performance below threshold. Dividends will be accrued on PSU awards and will be paid if and only to the extent PSUs are earned. These PSUs are intended to reward long-term performance, strengthen our pay for performance alignment with our stockholders and enhance retention of our Named Executive Officers. 2021-2023 PSU Performance and Payouts In the first quarter of 2024, our Compensation Committee reviewed and certified the Company’s performance against the four performance goals established for the January 1, 2021 - December 31, 2023 performance period. The Committee determined that performance exceeded maximum for one of the performance goals and equaled or exceeded threshold for the other three performance goals. As a result, units earned in the aggregate were slightly above target for the 2021-2023 PSU awards. Set forth in the charts below are (i) the applicable goals for each measure, (ii) the achievement with respect to each measure, (iii) the PSU opportunity associated with each measure and (iv) the total earned for each of our Named Executive Officers.

Other Benefits and Perquisites Our executive compensation program focuses on the elements described above, with limited provision for perquisites. Our Named Executive Officers are generally eligible to participate in the same benefit programs that we offer to other employees, which in 2023 included the following: • health, dental and vision insurance (for which we paid 90% of the premium in 2023); • short-term disability, long-term disability and life insurance coverage (at no cost to the employee); and • participation in a 401(k) plan (to which we made matching contributions of up to 4.0% of the employee’s base salary, up to the 2023 limit permitted by the Internal Revenue Service). We believe these benefits are competitive with overall market practices. In addition, we provide certain limited perquisites and other benefits to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. The only benefits provided to our Named Executive Officers in 2023 that were not otherwise available to all employees consisted of legacy supplemental disability and life insurance coverage, including reimbursement for taxes relating to that life insurance coverage for Ms. Cafaro, and an opportunity to receive an executive physical medical examination paid for by the Company. See footnote 4 to the 2023 Summary Compensation Table for additional information. Our Compensation Committee periodically reviews the perquisites and other personal benefits provided to each Named Executive Officer and has determined that they are consistent with current market practice. Except for the eligibility to participate in, and our matching contributions to, the 401(k) plan, as described above, we do not provide our Named Executive Officers with any retirement benefits. 72 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation 2024 Executive Compensation Decisions In the fall of 2023, with input from Semler Brossy, the Compensation Committee completed a review of our executive compensation program that considered, among other factors, peer benchmarking data and stockholder perspectives. Based on this review: • Ms. Cafaro's base salary was increased by 4%, effective January 1, 2024. The increased base salary was used to calculate Ms. Cafaro's 2024 annual incentive opportunity but was not applied to her 2024 long-term incentive opportunity. Thus, there was no change in the value of Ms. Cafaro's long-term incentive opportunity for the 2024-2026 performance period. • Mr. Hutchens' base salary was increased by 5%, with commensurate increases in the value of his annual and long-term incentive opportunities, reflecting his increased responsibilities due to his promotion in early 2023. There was no change in Mr. Hutchens' annual or long-term incentive opportunity as a percentage of base salary. • Base salaries for Mr. Probst, Mr. Bulgarelli and Ms. Roberts were increased by 4%, effective January 1, 2024. The increased base salary was used to calculate these executives' 2024 annual incentive opportunity but was not applied to their 2024 long-term incentive opportunity. Thus, there was no change in the value of the long-term incentive opportunity for Mr. Probst, Mr. Bulgarelli or Ms. Roberts for the 2024-2026 performance period. • 75% of annual incentive awards will be based on achievement of the following three corporate measures, with the remaining 25% based on individual performance (1) : • Normalized FFO/Share (45%), • Fixed Charge Coverage (20%) and • G&A Management and Expense Controls (10%) • 2024-2026 PSU Awards will measure achievement against three financial measures: • TSR relative to FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index (45%), • TSR relative to MSCI U.S. REIT Index (30%) and • Net Debt to Further Adjusted EBITDA (25%) (1) The annual incentive plan for the Outpatient Medical and Research Executive Vice President includes measures and goals specific to the outpatient medical & research ("OM&R", formerly Office) business. As in 2023, for 2024, 40% of the opportunity was allocated to corporate measures as described in the table above, 35% was allocated to measures and goals specific to the OM&R segment and 25% was allocated to individual objectives & performance, consistent with our other Executive Officers. The effect of these compensation decisions is outlined below. 2024 Target Compensation Named Executive Officer Base Salary Target Annual Incentive Target Long-Term Incentive Total Target Compensation Debra A.

Cafaro, Chief Executive Officer The Company entered into a second amended and restated employment agreement with Ms. Cafaro on March 22, 2011 (the “Cafaro Agreement”). Pursuant to the Cafaro Agreement, Ms. Cafaro is entitled to receive an annual base salary of not less than $915,000 and is eligible to participate in our incentive and other employee benefit plans. The Cafaro Agreement also requires that we provide Ms. Cafaro with $2 million of life insurance coverage and executive disability coverage that would provide annual benefits of at least 100% of her base salary. The term of Ms. Cafaro’s employment will continue until terminated or the Cafaro Agreement is amended. The Cafaro Agreement also provides that Ms. Cafaro will receive severance payments under certain termination scenarios, as described below. 2024 | Proxy Statement 73 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Agreements with Other Named Executive Officers The Company entered into letter agreements with each of our other Named Executive Officers in connection with their employment with the Company (the “Executive Offer Letters”). The Executive Offer Letters established the initial annual base salary and threshold, target and maximum bonus opportunities, as a percentage of base salary, for our annual and long-term incentive plans. The Executive Offer Letters also confirmed that each recipient would be eligible to participate in the Company’s medical and other benefit plans pursuant to their terms. Each of our other Named Executive Officers also is a party to an Employee Protection and Noncompetition Agreement (the "Executive Severance Agreements") as described below. Severance Arrangements The Cafaro Agreement and the Executive Severance Agreements executed with each of our other Named Executive Officers contain provisions regarding payments to be made in certain termination scenarios. These arrangements, and the provisions in our equity award agreements regarding termination, are summarized in the Executive Compensation Tables of this Proxy Statement, under the heading “Termination Provisions—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control.” Other Policies • Minimum Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers. Our minimum stock ownership guidelines require each executive officer to maintain a minimum equity investment in our Company based upon a multiple of their base salary, as set forth below. Pursuant to our guidelines, each executive officer must achieve the minimum equity investment within five years from the date they first become subject to the guidelines and, until that time, must retain at least 60% of the after-tax shares of our common stock granted to the executive officer or purchased by the executive officer through the exercise of stock options. Shares held in a trust or foundation that are not reported as beneficially owned by the executive, performance awards that have not yet vested and stock options that have not been exercised are not included when calculating an executive officer's share ownership. Stock appreciation rights, if granted, and shares subject to floors, collars or other hedging arrangements, if permitted, also would be excluded from this calculation pursuant to the Company's policy. Each of our Named Executive Officers is in compliance with these Guidelines. The Minimum Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers can be found in our Guidelines on Governance at https:// ir.ventasreit.com/governance. Stock Ownership Requirement CEO 6X base salary All other Executive Officers 3X base salary • Recoupment Policy. In accordance with rules adopted by the SEC and the NYSE, the Company adopted an Amended and Restated Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation, effective December 1, 2023, that requires our executive officers and our chief accounting officer to repay incentive-based compensation in the event the Company is required to prepare a financial restatement to correct a material error. Under this policy, each covered officer will be required to repay any excess incentive-based compensation granted, earned or vested during the preceding three-year period based wholly or in part on a financial reporting measure if the incentive compensation was based on achieving certain financial results that were later restated due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement. • Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy. Our Securities Trading Policy prohibits our directors, executive officers and employees from engaging in derivative and other hedging transactions in our securities and prohibits our executive officers and directors from holding our securities in margin accounts or otherwise pledging our securities to secure loans. No executive officer or director engaged in hedging transactions, pledged or held our securities in margin accounts at any time during 2023. • Tax Considerations. Section 162(m) of the Code generally places a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any year with respect to certain executive officers. Although we consider the impact of Section 162(m), as well as other tax and accounting consequences, when developing and implementing our executive compensation programs, our Compensation Committee retains flexibility to make compensation decisions that do not meet the requirements for tax deductibility when it considers it appropriate or necessary to do so. 74 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the above Compensation Discussion and Analysis.

Probst, Bulgarelli and Hutchens and for Ms. Roberts, one-time retention RSUs granted in January 2021), calculated pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 718 for financial reporting purposes. The grant date fair value of RSUs is determined by multiplying the number of units granted by the closing price of a share of company common stock on the date of grant. In calculating the grant date fair value of PSUs for financial reporting purposes, we use a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the grant date fair value of the TSR-driven components and the closing price on the date of grant, assuming performance at target—which was the probable outcome at the grant date—for other components. The Monte Carlo simulation “probability weights” potential outcomes of the relative TSR measures of each PSU award as of the grant date, based on, among other things, assumptions related to volatility, correlation and interest rates, which can fluctuate significantly year-over-year. As a result, the grant date fair value of our PSU Awards is higher in some years and lower in other years than the grant date face value at target, which is calculated using the closing stock price on the date of grant. 76 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation The following table presents the (i) grant date fair value of our stock awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 as outlined above (“Grant Date Fair Value”) and (ii) grant date value of our stock awards (RSU and PSU awards) using our closing stock price on the date of grant assuming (a) target level of performance is achieved for the PSU awards (“Target Grant Date Face Value”) and (b) maximum level of performance is achieved for the PSU awards (“Max Grant Date Face Value”). 2021 data includes the value of the supplemental retention awards to our NEOs other than our CEOs.

All outstanding option awards are fully vested and will expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. (2) Shares or Units That Have Not Vested as of fiscal year end consist of RSUs that vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Our Named Executive Officers are generally entitled to dividends paid on unvested RSUs. The vesting dates and number of shares vesting for each of our Named Executive Officers are as follows: 2024 | Proxy Statement 79 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Vest Date Ms. Cafaro Mr. Probst Mr. Bulgarelli Mr. Hutchens Ms. Roberts 2024 1/25/2024 25,047 17,582 12,540 9,279 1/29/2024 23,388 2/1/2024 33,780 14,155 10,118 11,360 9,436 2025 2/1/2025 33,780 14,153 10,117 11,360 9,435 2026 2/1/2026 17,311 7,323 5,284 6,533 5,056 (3) Equity Incentive Awards That Have Not Vested as of fiscal year end consist of estimated payouts for our 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 PSU Awards. These awards may be earned and vest, if at all, following completion of the applicable three-year performance period. Performance under our 2022-2024 program was tracking between target and maximum and our 2023-2025 program was tracking between threshold and target at the end of the 2023 fiscal year. Accordingly, the amounts shown in the table reflect the number of shares that would be payable for achievement at maximum under our 2022-2024 PSU program and at target under our 2023-2025 PSU program. (4) The Market or Payout Value of Unearned Shares, Units or other Rights that Have Not Vested includes the following: (i) the market value of unvested RSUs and PSUs was determined by multiplying the number of shares/units by $49.84, the closing price of our common stock on December 29, 2023; (ii) the number of PSUs used to calculate the payout value assumes performance at maximum for our 2022-2024 PSU awards and at target for our 2023-2025 PSU awards; and (iii) the payout value of PSUs includes the value of dividend equivalent rights (excluding any interest that may become payable thereon) relating to those PSUs. Dividend equivalents are accrued and paid on our Named Executive Officers’ PSUs if and only to the extent PSUs are earned based on performance during the applicable performance period. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in Note 3, the value of the dividend equivalent rights reported below and included in the total PSU value in the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End Table reflects dividends that would have been earned as of fiscal year end assuming achievement at maximum for 2022-2024 and target for 2023-2025 PSU awards.

The treatment of outstanding equity awards is different on death, disability or retirement, or in certain termination scenarios, as set forth below. Awards to Ms. Cafaro Termination by Company without Cause or by Executive for Good Reason Termination without Cause in Connection with a Change in Control Death or Disability Retirement (1) Restricted Stock Units Full vesting Full vesting upon Qualifying Termination (2) Full vesting Full vesting Performance Share Units Full vesting; payout at maximum Full vesting upon Qualifying Termination; payout at maximum Full vesting; payout at greater of (i) actual performance through date of termination and (ii) target Full vesting; payout at greater of (i) actual performance through date of termination and (ii) target Awards to Other Named Executive Officers Termination by Company without Cause or by Executive for Good Reason Termination without Cause in Connection with a Change in Control Death or Disability Retirement (1) Restricted Stock Units Accelerated vesting of shares that were scheduled to vest within one year from date of termination Full vesting upon Qualifying Termination (2) Full vesting Full vesting Performance Share Units Prorated vesting; payout based on actual performance through date of termination Full vesting upon Qualifying Termination; payout at greater of (i) actual performance through Change in Control and (ii) target (3) Full vesting; payout based on actual performance through date of termination Prorated vesting; payout based on actual performance through date of termination 2021 Retention RSUs Forfeit Full vesting Full vesting Forfeit (1) Retirement is defined as age plus years of service equal to 75, with a minimum age of 62. Ms. Cafaro is retirement eligible. In the event of his Early Retirement, defined as age plus years of service equal to 70, with a minimum age of 65, Mr. Bulgarelli will receive accelerated vesting of Restricted Stock Units that were scheduled to vest within one year from the date of his Early Retirement and prorated vesting of Performance Share Units with payout based on actual performance through date of termination. Mr. Bulgarelli will become eligible for Early Retirement on April 5, 2024. (2) A Qualifying Termination is defined as a termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason that occurs (a) within six months prior to the announcement of a proposed transaction that results in a Change in Control; (b) between the date of that announcement and the Change in Control; or (c) within 24 months following a Change in Control. (3) In the event of a Change in Control that does not result in a Qualifying Termination, Performance Share Units will (i) be measured for each metric as of the date of the Change in Control and (ii) remain outstanding and subject to the Named Executive Officer’s continued employment through the original vesting dates (except in the case of a Qualifying Termination or Retirement), and the applicable Named Executive Officer will be entitled to (i) in the case of Ms. Cafaro, the greater of target and actual performance on each metric and (ii) in the case of the other Named Executive Officers, the actual performance on each metric. 2024 | Proxy Statement 83 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Payments The table below reflects the amount of compensation and benefits payable to each other Named Executive Officer in the event of: • Termination for Cause or without Good Reason; • Termination other than for Cause or with Good Reason (“Involuntary Termination”); • a Change in Control (without any termination of employment); • Involuntary Termination following a Change in Control; • Death or Disability; and • Retirement, if eligible. The amounts shown are the amounts that would have been payable to the Named Executive Officers assuming the applicable termination had occurred on December 31, 2023. Receipt of benefits upon termination is subject to the execution of a general release of claims by the Named Executive Officer or their beneficiary.

Cafaro 3 3 Robert F. Probst 1 2 Peter J. Bulgarelli 1 2.5 J. Justin Hutchens 1 2.5 Carey S. Roberts 1 2.5 (2) Equity Award Vesting. Included in the table are (i) amounts attributable to vesting of unvested RSU awards and (ii) amounts payable pursuant to the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 PSU Awards. Amounts payable pursuant to the 2021-2023 PSU Awards, which were paid in February 2024, are not included because those awards are considered vested as of December 31, 2023. Because the 2022-2024 plan was performing above target and the 2023-2025 plan was performing below target as of December 31, 2023, amounts payable assume performance based on actual achievement for the 2022-2024 PSU Awards and target results through December 31, 2023 for the 2023-2025 PSU Awards in the scenarios where the award agreements provide for a payout at the higher of actual performance or target. 2024 | Proxy Statement 85 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Because the PSU awards convert to time-based awards upon a Change in Control and remain subject to the remaining vesting schedule in the event of a Change of Control in the absence of a Qualifying Termination (or subsequent retirement in the case of Ms. Cafaro only), we have not reported any PSU award values in the “Change in Control (without Termination)” column. (3) Equity Award Value. The value attributed to vesting of RSUs and PSUs is determined by multiplying the number of units by $49.84, the closing price of our common stock on December 29, 2023, the last business day of our 2023 fiscal year. For PSUs, the value also includes dividend equivalents (excluding any interest that may become payable thereon) that would have been earned as of fiscal year end based on the performance assumptions described in Note 2. (4) Insurance Benefits. In the event of her Disability, Ms. Cafaro would receive continued medical and dental premiums for a period of 24 months. In the event of her Involuntary Termination without Cause or for Good Reason, Ms. Cafaro would receive continued health, dental, life, short-term disability and long-term disability insurance premiums for a period of 24 months. In the event of Involuntary Termination without Cause or for Good Reason for each of our other Named Executive Officers, the executive would receive continued health, dental and vision insurance premiums for a period of 12 months (24 months if such termination occurs within one year of a Change of Control). (5) Reduction. Pursuant to the Cafaro Agreement and the Executive Severance Agreements with our other Named Executive Officers, under certain circumstances, payments or benefits are subject to reduction such that there will be no taxes imposed upon them by Section 4999 of the Code or any similar state or local tax. Determination of the reduction amount is based on a number of assumptions (including no value being assigned to restrictive covenants such as noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions), which may ultimately be different at the time of a Change of Control or Qualifying Termination, resulting in corresponding adjustments to, or elimination of, the reduction amount. CEO Pay Ratio As required by SEC regulations, we are providing information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO. For 2023, the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than our CEO) was $114,544 and the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table above, was $13,520,625. The ratio of our CEO’s 2023 annual total compensation to our median employee’s 2023 annual total compensation is 118 to 1. Our median employee was determined as of December 31, 2023 by selecting the employee, out of all of our employees who were employed on such date, with the median 2023 target total direct compensation (sum of base salary, target annual cash bonus and target equity award). The pay ratio presented in this Proxy Statement is a reasonable estimate calculated in good faith, in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the “median employee” and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio set forth above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 2023 Pay vs. Performance Pay vs. Performance Table As required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about “Compensation Actually Paid,” as defined by the SEC and in Footnote 2 below, and certain financial performance of the Company. 86 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation Average Summary Compensation Table Total for Other NEOs (1) Average Compensation Actually Paid to Other NEOs (2) Value of Initial Fixed $100 Investment Based On: Year Summary Compensation Table Total for CEO (1) Compensation Actually Paid to CEO (2) Total Shareholder Return (TSR) FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index TSR (3) GAAP Net Income (Loss) (in 000s) Normalized FFO/ Share (4) 2023 $ 13,520,625 $ 10,139,836 $ 4,107,540 $ 3,806,036 $ 102.39 $ 92.96 $ ( 40,973 ) $ 2.99 2022 14,059,092 17,813,641 4,224,753 4,826,766 88.97 81.59 ( 47,447 ) 2.99 2021 14,263,728 9,914,452 6,012,810 5,967,437 97.29 104.85 49,008 2.90 2020 12,628,714 9,443,112 5,404,681 4,924,463 90.29 90.14 439,149 3.32 (1) The Named Executive Officers in the fiscal years identified above were: Year CEO Other NEOs 2023 Debra A.

We have chosen to include the FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index TSR as our peer group TSR in this table as this is one of the primary measures of performance used in our long-term incentive plan. (4) Normalized FFO/Share is one of the primary measures used in our Annual Incentive Plan. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, we consider Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. For information regarding the calculation of Normalized FFO, please see Appendix A. To calculate Normalized FFO on per share basis, Normalized FFO is divided by weighted average diluted shares as set forth in Note 15 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 88 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Financial Performance Measures The line graphs below compare Compensation Actually Paid to our CEO and the average Compensation Actually Paid to our Other NEOs to (i) our cumulative TSR, (ii) FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index TSR (“Nareit TSR”), (iii) our Net Income (Loss) and (iv) our Normalized FFO/Share, in each case, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

As part of its regular processes, our Audit and Compliance Committee also annually reviews and approves the leadership and organization of the external audit team, periodically considers the rotation of the independent external audit firm and is directly involved, in conjunction with the mandated rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm’s lead audit partner, in the review and approval of our independent registered public accounting firm’s lead audit partner. Our Audit and Compliance Committee has selected KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. KPMG was first engaged to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm in July 2014, and each member of the Audit and Compliance Committee believes that the continued retention of KPMG to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for this fiscal year is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. At the 2024 Annual Meeting, we are asking you to ratify the selection of KPMG as our external audit firm for this year. We and the Board value our stockholders’ views on this matter, and we believe seeking stockholder ratification of KPMG’s selection is a matter of good corporate practice. If our stockholders fail to ratify this selection, it will be considered a recommendation to the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board to consider the selection of a different firm, and the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board may select another independent registered public accounting firm without resubmitting the matter to the stockholders. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit and Compliance Committee may, in its discretion, select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. We expect that representatives of KPMG will be present at the 2024 Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and have the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire. Our Board recommends that you vote FOR ratification of the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2024. 92 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Audit Matters Audit and Non-Audit Fees KPMG audited our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and has been our independent registered public accounting firm since July 2014. Fees billed for professional services rendered by KPMG for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were as follows: Fees 2023 2022 Audit Fees (1) $ 4,197,900 $ 3,670,900 Audit-Related Fees (2) 29,930 17,430 Tax Fees — — All Other Fees (3) — 100,000 Total $4,227,830 $ 3,788,330 (1) Audit Fees include the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by KPMG for the audit of our annual consolidated and entity level financial statements (including debt covenant compliance letters), audit of internal control over financial reporting, review of interim financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and statutory audits for subsidiaries, advice on audit and accounting matters that arose during, or as a result of, the audit or the review of interim financial statements and work on securities offerings and other filings with the SEC, including comfort letters, consents and comment letters. (2) Audit-Related Fees in 2023 and 2022 relate to consultations on accounting matters and the Company’s subscription to KPMG’s online accounting research tool. (3) All Other Fees in 2022 relate to tax consulting. All audit-related services, tax services and other services provided by KPMG since the date of its engagement have been pre-approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee in accordance with the Committee’s pre-approval policies described below. In addition, consistent with its charter and other applicable rules and policies, the Audit and Compliance Committee determined that the provision of these services by KPMG did not compromise KPMG’s independence and was consistent with its role as our independent registered public accounting firm. Policy on Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non- Audit Services The terms of our engagement of KPMG are subject to the pre-approval of the Audit and Compliance Committee. Our Audit and Compliance Committee observes and implements certain procedures relating to the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by KPMG to ensure that the provision of such services and related fees does not impair the firm’s independence. In accordance with these procedures, the annual audit services and related fees of KPMG are subject to approval by our Audit and Compliance Committee. Prior to its engagement, KPMG must provide the Audit and Compliance Committee with an engagement letter outlining the scope of proposed audit services for that year and the related fees. The Audit and Compliance Committee will then review and approve, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Company structure or other matters. In addition, our Audit and Compliance Committee may grant pre-approval for those permissible non-audit services that it believes would not impair the independence of KPMG. However, the Audit and Compliance Committee may not grant approval for any services categorized by the SEC as “Prohibited Non-Audit Services.” Following review, the Audit and Compliance Committee pre-approves the non-audit services within each category that it believes are reasonable and appropriate and that it concludes will not impair the firm’s independence, and the fees for each category are budgeted. The term of any pre-approved non-audit service is 12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit and Compliance Committee specifically provides for a different period. Fee levels for all non-audit services to be provided by KPMG are established periodically by the Audit and Compliance Committee, and any proposed services exceeding those levels require separate pre-approval by the Audit and Compliance Committee. To obtain approval of other permissible non-audit services, management must submit to the Audit and Compliance Committee those non-audit services for which it recommends the Audit and Compliance Committee engage the independent registered public accounting firm, and both management and KPMG must confirm to the Audit and Compliance Committee that each non-audit service for which approval is requested is not a Prohibited Non-Audit Service. 2024 | Proxy Statement 93 Table of Contents Audit Matters Our Chief Accounting Officer is responsible for tracking all fees for pre-approved non-audit services provided by KPMG, and at each regularly scheduled Audit and Compliance Committee meeting, management reports on the pre-approved non-audit services provided during the quarter and year-to-date and the fees incurred for such services during such periods. All services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm have been pre-approved in accordance with these procedures. The Audit and Compliance Committee has determined that the services performed by KPMG and the related fees were consistent with the maintenance of KPMG’s independence. Audit and Compliance Committee Report A role of the Audit and Compliance Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight of the quality and integrity of the Company’s financial reports. Management has primary responsibility for our financial statements and the reporting process, including our system of internal controls, subject to oversight by our Audit and Compliance Committee on behalf of our Board. KPMG is responsible for auditing the Company’s financial statements and its internal control over financial reporting, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) and expressing opinions as to the conformity of the financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit and Compliance Committee has reviewed and discussed with management our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. Our Audit and Compliance Committee has reviewed and discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB and the SEC. The Audit and Compliance Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by applicable PCAOB rules regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit and Compliance Committee concerning independence. In addition, our Audit and Compliance Committee has discussed with KPMG that firm’s independence from our Company and its management, and the Audit and Compliance Committee has considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the firm’s independence. Our Audit and Compliance Committee has discussed with KPMG the overall scope and plans for its audit. The Audit and Compliance Committee meets regularly with KPMG, with and without management present, to discuss the results of its examination of our financial statements, its evaluations of our internal controls and the overall quality of our financial reporting. In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit and Compliance Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for filing with the SEC. The Audit and Compliance Committee also selected KPMG to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2024. Audit and Compliance Committee Walter C.

Beneficial owners may also attend and vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting using the control number on their voting instruction form. Eligibility Only Ventas stockholders of record at the close of business on March 18, 2024, the record date, are entitled to vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting. As of the record date, approximately 404,048,823 shares of our common stock, par value $0.25 per share, were outstanding. Each share of our common stock entitles the owner to one vote on each matter properly brought before the 2024 Annual Meeting. However, certain shares designated as “Excess Shares” (generally any shares owned by a beneficial owner in excess of 9.0% of our outstanding common stock) or as “Special Excess Shares” pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our “Charter”), may not be voted by the beneficial or record owner of those shares and will be voted in accordance with Article IX of our Charter. Votes by Proxy All shares that have been properly voted by proxy and not revoked will be voted at the 2024 Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy. Shares represented by proxy cards that are signed and returned but do not contain any voting instructions will be voted consistent with the Board’s recommendations.

Questions and Answers What is a proxy? What is a proxy statement? A proxy is a legal designation of a person to vote on your behalf. A proxy statement is the document we must give you when we solicit your proxy. It is required by SEC rules. By completing and returning the enclosed proxy card, you are giving each of the individuals designated as proxies in the proxy card the authority to vote your shares in the manner you indicate on your proxy card. What items will be voted on at the 2024 Annual Meeting? Stockholders will vote on the following items if each is properly presented at the 2023 Annual Meeting. ITEMS: Board Recommendation Page Reference 1 To elect the 12 director nominees named in the Proxy Statement to serve until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders FOR each director nominee 9 2 To approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers FOR 47 3 To ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2024 fiscal year FOR 92 2024 | Proxy Statement 99 Table of Contents Additional Information How do I revoke a vote? If you are a stockholder of record, you can revoke your prior vote by proxy if you: 1. execute and return a later-dated proxy card before your proxy is voted at the 2024 Annual Meeting; 2. vote by telephone or over the internet; 3. deliver a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices located at 353 North Clark Street, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois 60654; or 4. vote in person at the 2024 Annual Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner, follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or custodian to revoke your vote prior to the meeting. What are broker non-votes? A broker non-vote occurs when a beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions to the beneficial owner’s broker or custodian with respect to a “non-routine” proposal, on which the broker or custodian does not have discretionary authority to vote. The ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent public accounting firm for fiscal year 2024 (Proposal 3) is considered a “routine” matter; brokers have discretionary authority to vote on that proposal. How are proxies solicited and what is the cost? We bear the cost of soliciting proxies by or on behalf of our Board. We pay for the cost of proxy preparation and solicitation, including the reasonable charges and expenses of brokerage firms, banks, trusts or nominees for forwarding proxy materials to street name holders. We have engaged Innisfree to distribute and solicit proxies on our behalf, and we expect to pay Innisfree approximately $75,000 plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these services. We also will reimburse brokers and other custodians for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with distributing forms of proxies and proxy materials to beneficial owners of our common stock. What is householding? To eliminate duplicate mailings, conserve natural resources and reduce our printing costs and postage fees, we engage in “householding,” which means that we will deliver a single set of proxy materials (other than proxy cards, which will remain separate) to our stockholders who share the same address and who have the same last name or consent in writing. If your household receives multiple copies of our proxy materials, you may request to receive only one copy by contacting Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at 1-866-540-7095 or in writing at Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Similarly, if your household receives only one copy of our proxy materials, you may request an additional copy by contacting Broadridge as indicated above. We will deliver the requested additional copy promptly following our receipt of your request. Electronic Document Delivery to Stockholders Stockholders of record and most beneficial owners may elect to receive an e-mail that will contain electronic links to our Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement and 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Electronic document delivery is better for the environment and saves us the cost of producing and mailing documents. It will give you a direct electronic link to the proxy voting site. Active employees of the Company who hold common stock in certain employee benefit plan accounts or are stockholders of record generally receive their proxy materials by electronic delivery to their business e-mail accounts. We will mail to stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials and how to vote by proxy online. We will also mail this Proxy Statement and the materials accompanying it to stockholders who have requested paper copies. If you would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy material by mail, you should follow the instructions for requesting those materials included in the Notice that we will mail to you.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Proxy Statement contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated results from operations and developments, goals and objectives and other matters that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our and our officers’ intent, belief or expectation as identified by the use of words such as “assume,” “may,” “will,” “project,” “expect,” believe,” “intend, ”anticipate,” “seek,” “target,” “forecast,” “plan,” “potential,” "opportunity," “estimate,” “could,” “would,” “should” and other comparable and derivative terms or the negatives thereof. The forward- looking statements are based on management’s beliefs as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events. You should not put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of performance and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward- looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. Certain factors that could prevent Ventas from achieving its stated goals include those made in the “Summary Risk Factors” section, “Risk Factors” section and “Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and that are otherwise described or updated from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. 2024 | Proxy Statement 101 Table of Contents Appendix A: Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation Non-GAAP Financial Measures This Proxy Statement includes certain financial performance measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). We consider these non- GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this Proxy Statement. We believe such measures provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with the performance of other REITs.

(2) Includes adjustments for other unusual items, including: (i) approximately $5.5 million payment obligation arising in connection with sale of real estate, and (ii) approximately $2.7 million related to certain legal matters, primarily related to class action litigation in our SHOP segment. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers Nareit FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), Nareit FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results. Nareit Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Nareit FFO”) The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. A-2 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Appendix A: Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation Normalized FFO The Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction, transition and restructuring costs and amortization of intangibles; (b) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on the Company’s income statement and non-cash charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other items related to unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events; and (h) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein. Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented elsewhere herein.

The Company considers NOI and Cash NOI as important supplemental measures because they allow investors, analysts and the Company’s management to assess its unlevered property-level operating results and to compare its operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. A-4 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Appendix A: Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation NOI The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses. Cash NOI The Company defines Cash NOI as NOI for its reportable business segments (i.e., SHOP, OM&R and Triple-Net), determined on a Constant Currency basis, excluding the impact of, without duplication (i) non-cash items such as straight- line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (ii) sold assets, assets held for sale, development properties not yet operational and land parcels and (iii) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. In certain cases, results may be adjusted to reflect the receipt of cash payments, fees, and other consideration that is not fully recognized as NOI in the period. Same-store The Company defines same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company may include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in the Company’s judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of its segment performance. Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Company’s SHOP reportable business segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped properties in the outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. SHOP and triple-net leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented. Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by materially disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a materially disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for the outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property- level expenditures to maximize value, increase NOI, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for SHOP and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period. Constant Currency To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results are shown in actual reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average exchange rate for the current period. 2024 | Proxy Statement A-5 Table of Contents Appendix A: Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation Non-GAAP Performance Measures We use Fixed Charge Coverage and Net Debt to Further Adjusted EBITDA (also referenced as Net Debt to EBITDA) as performance measures. Fixed Charge Coverage is calculated in accordance with the definition used in our revolving credit facility. Additional information regarding Net Debt to Further Adjusted EBITDA is as follows: Net Debt to Further Adjusted EBITDA For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 (Dollars in thousands USD; totals may not sum due to rounding; unaudited) Net loss $ (90,819) Adjustments: Interest expense 154,853 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 85 Taxes (including tax amounts in general, administrative and professional fees) 5,743 Depreciation and amortization 435,276 Non-cash stock-based compensation expense 5,690 Transaction, transition and restructuring costs 3,635 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, adjusted for partners’ share of consolidated entity EBITDA (3,491) Loss from unconsolidated entities, adjusted for Ventas' share of EBITDA from unconsolidated entities 30,539 Gain on real estate dispositions (39,802) Unrealized foreign currency gain (320) Change in fair value of financial instruments (24,375) Materially disruptive events, net (1,901) Allowance on loan investments and impairment of unconsolidated entities, net of noncontrolling interest (73) Other normalizing items (1) 2,750 Adjusted EBITDA $ 477,790 Adjustment for current period activity 1,035 Further Adjusted EBITDA $ 478,825 Further Adjusted EBITDA annualized $ 1,915,300 Total debt $ 13,490,896 Cash (508,794) Restricted cash pertaining to debt (29,019) Partners’ share of consolidated debt (297,480) Ventas’ share of unconsolidated debt 575,329 Net debt $ 13,230,932 Net debt / Further Adjusted EBITDA 6.9 x (1) Includes adjustments for other unusual items related to certain legal matters, primarily related to class action litigation in our SHOP segment. A-6 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Appendix A: Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation The Company believes that Net Debt, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt to Further Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors, analysts and Company management because they allow the comparison of the Company’s credit strength between periods and to other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment and valuation allowances), excluding (a) gains or losses on extinguishment of debt; (b) noncontrolling interests’ share of adjusted EBITDA; (c) transaction, transition and restructuring costs; (d) net gains or losses on real estate activity; (e) gains or losses on re-measurement of equity interest upon acquisition; (f) changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (g) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (h) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events; and (i) non-cash charges related to leases, and including (x) Ventas’s share of adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities and (y) the impact of other items set forth in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein. Further Adjusted EBITDA Further Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for transactions and events that were completed during the period, as if the transaction or event had been consummated at the beginning of the relevant period and considers any other incremental items set forth in the Further Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein. 2024 | Proxy Statement A-7 Table of Contents Helpful Resources Annual Meeting Information Proxy Materials and 2023 Annual Report: www.proxyvote.com About Ventas Website www.ventasreit.com Leadership www.ventasreit.com/about-ventas/leadership Corporate Governance ir.ventasreit.com/governance/ Corporate Sustainability Report www.ventasreit.com/sites/default/files/pdf/VentasCSR_2023.pdf Investor & Stockholder Services Investor Relations ir.ventasreit.com/overview/default.aspx Company Presentations and Earnings Calls ir.ventasreit.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx Request for Information ir.ventasreit.com/resources/request-for-information/default.aspx Corporate Governance Committee Charters and Guidelines on Governance ir.ventasreit.com/governance/governance-documents/default.aspx Financial Information Annual and Quarterly Reports and Supplemental Information ir.ventasreit.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx SEC Filings ir.ventasreit.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx Stock & Dividend Information Stock Information ir.ventasreit.com/stock-info/default.aspx Dividend Information ir.ventasreit.com/stock-info/dividend-history/default.aspx Form 8937 – Organizational Actions ir.ventasreit.com/stock-info/form-8937-organizational-actions/default.aspx Acronyms Used CD&A Compensation Discussion & Analysis Nareit National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts CEO Chief Executive Officer NEO Named Executive Officer CFO Chief Financial Officer NOI Net Operating Income DE&I Diversity, Equity and Inclusion NNN Triple-Net EBITDA Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization NYSE New York Stock Exchange ESG Environmental, Social and Governance OM&R Outpatient Medical and Research Portfolio EVP Executive Vice President PCAOB Public Company Accounting Oversight Board FASB Financial Accounting Standards Board PSU Performance Share Unit FFO Funds From Operations REIT Real Estate Investment Trust G&A General and Administrative Expense R&I Research & Innovation GAAP U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles RSU Restricted Stock Unit GTL Group Term Life Insurance SEC Securities and Exchange Commission HHS U.S. Department of Health & Human Services SHOP Senior Housing Operating Portfolio KMPG KPMG LLP TSR Total Shareholder Return M/WBE Minority/Woman-Owned Business Enterprise VIM Ventas Investment Management A-8 2024 | Proxy Statement Table of Contents Website References Readers may also access additional information about Ventas, Inc. at www.ventasreit.com , our corporate website.
