How many votes are needed to approve each of the proposals? Directors will be elected by a majority of the votes cast. To be elected, the number of shares voted “FOR” a director must exceed the number of shares voted “AGAINST” that director. Abstentions will have no effect in director elections. Each other proposal will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against such proposal. Broker non-votes are not counted as either votes for or votes against a proposal. What are broker non-votes? Brokers may vote on routine matters, such as ratification of the independent auditor, without customer voting instructions. However, brokers may not vote on non-routine matters, such as the election of directors, approval of executive compensation and frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation, without customer voting instructions. Broker-held shares that are not voted on non-routine matters are referred to as broker non-votes. How many votes are needed for a quorum? Under our By-laws, a quorum is one third of the voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. Both abstentions and broker non-votes are counted in determining that a quorum is present for the meeting. Who pays for the proxy solicitation related to the meeting? We do. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies by telephone, in person or by other means. They will receive no additional compensation for this work. We will arrange for brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy solicitation material MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 2 to the beneficial owners of common stock, and we will reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with forwarding the material. How will other matters raised at the meeting be voted? If any matters other than those on the proxy card are presented at the meeting, the proxy committee will vote on them using its best judgment. Under our By-laws, notice of any matter to be presented by a stockholder for a vote at the meeting must have been received by our corporate Secretary between December 14, 2016 and January 13, 2017, accompanied by certain information about the stockholder presenting it. We have not received notice of any matter to be presented. If I want to submit a stockholder proposal for consideration at the 2018 Annual Meeting, when is that proposal due? Stockholder proposals submitted for inclusion in our 2018 Proxy Statement must be received in writing by our corporate Secretary no later than the close of business on December 20, 2017.

To request separate or single delivery of these materials now or in the future, call us at 1-866-984-7755 or write to us at Marathon Oil Corporation, Investor Relations Office, 5555 San Felipe Street, Houston, Texas, 77056-2701. 3 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS Under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, directors are elected for terms expiring at the next succeeding Annual Meeting of stockholders. We have eight nominees for director whose terms expire in 2017. Each director is nominated for a one-year term expiring at the 2018 Annual Meeting. Directors are elected by a majority of votes cast. For a director to be elected, the number of shares cast FOR a director must exceed the number of votes cast AGAINST that director. Abstentions will have no effect in director elections. If any nominee for whom you have voted becomes unable to serve, your proxy may be voted for another person designated by the Board. Our By-laws require any incumbent who does not receive sufficient votes to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation or take other action. The Board will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee’s recommendation, and publicly disclose its decision regarding the tendered resignation within 90 days after certification of the election results. In the event of a vacancy, the Board may fill the position or decrease the size of the Board. DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS AND NOMINATIONS Our Corporate Governance Principles set forth the process for director selection and director qualifications. In summary, the chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the CEO, and the secretaries of the Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee should work with a third-party professional search firm to review director candidates and their credentials. At least one member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Chairman of the Board and the CEO should meet with the director candidate. This screening process applies to nominees recommended by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, as well as nominees recommended by our stockholders in accordance with our By-laws or applicable law. Selection of new directors includes an evaluation of their independence, as discussed below under “Director Independence,” their business or professional experience, their integrity and judgment, their record of public service, their ability to devote sufficient time to the affairs of the Company, the diversity of backgrounds and experience they will bring to the Board, and the Company’s needs at that particular time. Directors should also be individuals of substantial accomplishment with demonstrated leadership capabilities, and they should represent all stockholders rather than any special interest group or constituency. Eligible stockholders may nominate a candidate for election to the Board for inclusion in our 2018 Proxy Statement in accordance with the “proxy access” provisions of our By-laws. Nominations must be received in writing by our corporate Secretary at least 90 days, but not more than 120 days, before the first anniversary of the date on which we first mailed our proxy materials for the preceding year’s Annual Meeting, and must otherwise comply with all of the requirements of the By-laws. Stockholder nominations for director submitted outside the “proxy access” process must be received in writing by our corporate Secretary at least 90 days, but not more than 120 days, before the first anniversary of the date on which we first mailed our proxy materials for the preceding year’s Annual Meeting, and must otherwise comply with all of the requirements of the By-laws. MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 4 DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE In accordance with applicable laws, regulations, our Corporate Governance Principles and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the Board must affirmatively determine the independence of each director and director nominee. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers all relevant facts and circumstances including, without limitation, transactions during the previous year between the Company and the director directly, immediate family members of the director, organizations with which the director is affiliated, and the frequency and dollar amounts associated with these transactions. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee further considers whether the transactions were at arm’s length in the ordinary course of business and whether the transactions were consummated on terms and conditions similar to those of unrelated parties. The Committee then makes a recommendation to the Board with respect to the independence of each director and director nominee. In assessing the independence of each director who served on the Board during 2016, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considered: contributions to the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology Foundation, of which Mr. Banister is a board of trustees member, contributions to the University of Wyoming Foundation, of which Mr. Deaton is a board member, made pursuant to a commitment entered into before Mr. Deaton joined the Board; contributions to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, of which Ms. Donadio serves on the Corporation Development Committee; royalty interests paid to family members and/or trusts affiliated with Mr. Deaton; and contributions to non-profit organizations of which Messrs. Deaton and Lader or their immediate family members are affiliates. Based on these considerations, the standards in our Corporate Governance Principles and the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board determined that the following directors are independent: Gaurdie E. Banister, Jr. Marcela E. Donadio Michael E. J. Phelps Gregory H. Boyce Philip Lader Dennis H. Reilley Chadwick C. Deaton As CEO of the Company, Mr. Tillman is not independent. DIRECTOR DIVERSITY The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for reviewing with the Board the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the Board’s current make-up. When we have an opening on the Board, we will always look at a diverse pool of candidates, considering each candidate’s business or professional experience, demonstrated leadership ability, integrity and judgment, record of public service, diversity, financial and technological acumen and international experience. We view and define diversity in its broadest sense, which includes gender, ethnicity, age, education, experience and leadership qualities. Of the eight director nominees, one is an officer of Marathon Oil, five have top executive experience with a wide variety of businesses, one has extensive audit and public accounting experience, and one has a distinguished career as an international business leader and diplomat. Each nominee’s background and qualifications are discussed further on the following pages. 5 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR | TERMS EXPIRE 2018 YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR EACH NOMINEE Mr. Banister, 59, retired as president and CEO of Aera Energy LLC (an oil and gas exploration and production company jointly owned by Shell Oil Company and ExxonMobil) in August 2015, having served in that position since 2007.

Lee M. Tillman Director since 2013 Management/Non-Independent 9 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board, currently comprised of eight directors. The Board met 14 times in 2016. Attendance for Board and committee meetings was 97.5% for the full year. Under our Corporate Governance Principles, directors are expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All of our directors attended the 2016 Annual Meeting. Our Corporate Governance Principles require our non-employee directors to meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions. An offer of an executive session is extended to non-employee directors at each regularly scheduled Board meeting. In 2016, the non-employee directors held 10 independent executive sessions.

(1)    All the members of the Audit and Finance Committee meet the additional independence standards under Exchange Act Rule 10A-3. Based on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board has determined that each of Ms. Donadio and Mr. Phelps qualifies as an “Audit Committee Financial Expert” under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) rules based upon the attributes, education and experience discussed in their respective biographies above. 11 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE The Board does not have a policy regarding whether the roles of the Chairman and CEO should be separate, but rather makes this determination on the basis of what is best for our Company at a given point in time. Our current Chairman, Mr. Reilley, was appointed as non-executive chairman on January 1, 2014. As non-executive Chairman, Mr. Reilley presides at all meetings of stockholders and the Board, as well as at all executive sessions of the non-employee directors. We believe the Board leadership structure is appropriate for us at this time. THE BOARD’S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT Responsibility for risk oversight rests with the Board and its committees: • The Audit and Finance Committee annually reviews our enterprise risk management process and the latest assessment of risks and key mitigation strategies. It regularly reviews risks associated with financial and accounting matters and reporting. It monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and internal control systems, and reviews risks associated with financial strategies and the Company’s capital structure. • The Compensation Committee reviews the executive compensation program to ensure it does not encourage excessive risk-taking. It also reviews our executive compensation, incentive compensation and succession plans to ensure we have appropriate practices in place to support the retention and development of the talent necessary to achieve our business goals and objectives. • The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee regularly reviews and oversees operational risks, including those relating to health, environment, safety and security. It reviews risks associated with social, political and environmental trends, issues and concerns, domestic and international, which affect or could affect our business activities, performance and reputation. • The Board receives regular updates from the committees about these activities, and reviews additional risks not specifically within the purview of any particular committee and risks of a more strategic nature. Key risks associated with the strategic plan are reviewed annually at the Board’s strategy meeting and periodically throughout the year. While the Board and its committees oversee risk management, Company management is responsible for managing risk. We have a robust enterprise risk management process for identifying, assessing and managing risk, and monitoring risk mitigation strategies. Our CEO and CFO and a committee of executive officers and senior managers work across the business to manage each enterprise level risk and to identify emerging risks. RISK ASSESSMENT RELATED TO OUR COMPENSATION STRUCTURE The Compensation Committee regularly evaluates and considers the role of executive compensation programs in ensuring that our executive officers take only appropriate and prudent risks, and that compensation opportunities do not motivate excessive risk-taking. The practices we employ include: • All executive officer compensation decisions are made by the Compensation Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors. • The Compensation Committee is advised by an independent compensation consultant that performs no other work for executive management or our Company. MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 12 • Our executives do not have employment agreements. • The Compensation Committee manages our compensation programs to be competitive with those of peer companies and monitors our programs against trends in executive compensation on an annual basis. • Our compensation programs are intended to balance short-term and long-term incentives. • Our annual cash bonus program is based on a balanced set of objective metrics that are not predominantly influenced by commodity prices. In addition, the Compensation Committee considers the achievement of individual performance commitments and overall corporate performance. • Annual cash bonuses are determined and paid to executive officers only after the Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed audited financial statements for the performance year. • The Compensation Committee regularly evaluates share utilization in our 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan by reviewing overhang levels (dilutive impact of equity compensation on our stockholders) and annual run rates (the aggregate shares awarded as a percentage of total outstanding shares). • Our clawback policy applies to annual cash bonuses and is generally triggered with respect to an executive officer in the event of a material accounting restatement due to noncompliance with financial reporting requirements or an act of fraud by that executive officer.  Our long-term incentive awards for executive officers have similar provisions. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES Our Corporate Governance Principles address the Board’s general function, including its responsibilities, Board size, director elections and limits on the number of Board memberships. These principles also address Board independence, committee composition, the process for director selection and director qualifications, the Board’s performance review, the Board’s planning and oversight functions, director compensation and director retirement and resignation.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION Messrs. Boyce, Deaton, and Lader and Ms. Donadio served on the Compensation Committee for all of 2016. There are no matters relating to interlocks or insider participation that we are required to report. MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 14 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION The Board determines annual retainers and other compensation for non-employee directors. Mr. Tillman, the only director who is also an employee, receives no additional compensation for his service on the Board. CASH COMPENSATION Following are the annual cash retainers we paid our non-employee directors for 2016: Type of Fee Amount ($) Annual Board Retainer 150,000 Additional Retainer for Chairman of the Board 125,000 Additional Retainer for Audit and Finance Committee Chair 25,000 Additional Retainer for Compensation Committee Chair 25,000 Additional Retainer for Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee Chair 12,500 Additional Retainer for Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Chair 12,500 Directors do not receive meeting fees for attendance at Board or committee meetings. Non-employee directors may defer up to 100% of their annual retainer into an unfunded account under the Marathon Oil Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. These deferred amounts may be invested in certain investment options, which generally mirror the investment options offered to employees under our Thrift Plan. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS For 2016, non-employee directors received an annual common stock unit award valued at $175,000. These awards were credited to an unfunded account on the first business day of the calendar year, based on the closing stock price on the grant date. Prior to 2017, directors received dividend equivalents in the form of additional common stock units that were subsequently settled in common stock following vesting of the common stock units.  Effective in 2017, directors may elect to defer settlement of their common stock units until after they cease serving on the Board.  Directors who make such a deferral election continue to receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional common stock units, which will continue to be settled in common stock. For directors who elect not to defer their common stock units, the units vest in three years, and when dividends are paid on our common stock, directors receive dividend equivalents in cash, which is deferred until the vesting date of the related common stock units. These awards vest and are payable shortly after the earlier of (a) the third anniversary of the grant date, or (b) the director’s departure from the Board. Under our stock ownership guidelines, each non-employee director is expected to hold three times (four times in the case of the Chairman) the value of the annual retainer in Marathon Oil stock. Directors have five years from their initial election to the Board to meet this requirement. Directors who do not hold the required level of stock ownership due to fluctuations in the price of our common stock are expected to hold the awards they receive until they have met their requirement. As of January 31, 2017, all non-employee directors meet or exceed this ownership requirement. 15 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT MATCHING GIFTS PROGRAMS Under our matching gifts programs, we will annually match up to $10,000 in contributions made by non-employee directors to certain tax-exempt educational institutions. This annual limit is based on the date of the director’s gift to the institution.  We will also make a donation to a charity of the director’s choice equal to the amount of his or her contribution to the Marathon Oil Company Employees Political Action Committee (“MEPAC”) for contributions above $200.  MEPAC contributions are subject to a $5,000 annual limit. 2016 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE Name Fees Earned or Paid in Cash ($) Stock Awards (1) ($) All Other Compensation (2) ($) Total ($) Gaurdie E.

The Audit and Finance Committee is comprised of four directors, each of whom has been determined by the Board to be independent and financially literate under the NYSE’s requirements. See the director biographies under “Proposal 1: Election of Directors” for more information about the qualifications, education and experience of each Committee member. Based on these qualifications, the Board has determined that each of Marcela E. Donadio and Michael E. J. Phelps qualifies as an “Audit Committee Financial Expert” under the SEC’s rules. The Audit and Finance Committee’s responsibilities are set forth in its charter, available on our website at www.marathonoil.com/Investor_Center/Corporate_Governance/Board_Committees_and_Charters/ . The Audit and Finance Committee met a total of seven times in 2016, including four in-person meetings at which the Committee met with the Company’s internal audit organization and the independent auditor, with and without management present. Management has primary responsibility for preparing our financial statements and establishing and maintaining our internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s independent auditor is responsible for auditing our financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), and issuing its reports based on those audits. The Audit and Finance Committee oversees these processes. In connection with the evaluation, appointment and retention of the independent registered public accountants, the Audit and Finance Committee annually reviews the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent auditor and lead engagement partner, and assures the regular rotation of the lead engagement partner as required . In doing so, the Audit and Finance Committee considers a number of factors including, but not limited to: quality of services provided; technical expertise and knowledge of the industry; effective communication; objectivity; and independence. Based on this evaluation, the Audit and Finance Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the Company’s financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for 2017. In conjunction with the mandated rotation of the lead audit partner, the Audit and Finance Committee and its chairperson are directly involved in the selection of PwC’s lead engagement partner. The current lead engagement partner was selected in 2016, effective for 2017. We are seeking our stockholders’ ratification of the appointment of PwC to audit the Company’s financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for 2017 at the Annual Meeting. The Audit and Finance Committee and the Board believe the appointment of PwC as our independent auditor for 2017 is in the Company’s best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders. The Audit and Finance Committee reviews and pre-approves the fees and expenses of the independent auditor for audit, audit-related, tax and permissible non-audit services. See “Proposal 2: Ratification of Independent Auditor for 2017” for more information on our pre-approval policy. MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 20 In connection with the preparation of the Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the report on internal control over financial reporting for 2016: • The Audit and Finance Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Company’s audited financial statements and its report on internal control over financial reporting for 2016. • The Audit and Finance Committee met throughout the year with management and PwC, and met with PwC each quarter without the presence of management. The Committee discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the auditing standards of the PCAOB. • The Audit and Finance Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB for independent auditor communications with audit committees concerning independence, and has considered whether PwC’s provision of non-audit services to the Company was compatible with maintaining such independence. Based on this review and discussion, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to the Board that the Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the report on internal control over financial reporting be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE Michael E. J. Phelps, Chair Gaurdie E. Banister, Jr. Gregory H. Boyce Marcela E. Donadio COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Compensation Committee has reviewed with management the Company’s Compensation Discussion and Analysis for 2016. Based on that review, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE Gregory H. Boyce, Chair Chadwick C. Deaton Marcela E. Donadio Philip Lader 21 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes in detail the compensation paid to the named executive officers (“NEOs”) listed in the Summary Compensation Table. It is designed to provide stockholders with an understanding of our compensation principles and practices and insight into our decision-making process as it relates to the compensation of our NEOs. For 2016, our NEOs were: Name Title Lee M. Tillman President and Chief Executive Officer Patrick J. Wagner Interim Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy T. Mitchell Little Executive Vice President, Operations Sylvia J. Kerrigan Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary Catherine L. Krajicek Vice President, Conventional John R. Sult Former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Lance W. Robertson Former Vice President, Resource Plays EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2016 OPERATIONAL & FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 2016 was a year of delivering on our commitments, despite an extremely volatile commodity price environment that saw oil trade below $30 a barrel. We set a clear over-arching goal for 2016 – to live within our means by balancing capital expenditures and the dividend with operating cash flows and proceeds from our non-core asset sale program. Our success was predicated on capital discipline, portfolio management, operational execution and a relentless focus on our costs. Our original $1.4 billion capital program was revised down to $1.3 billion mid-year, and we ultimately finished the year at $1.1 billion while exceeding the midpoint of our production guidance. An intense focus on expense reductions was an essential component of living within our cash flows. Our North America E&P production expense averaged under $6 per  barrel of oil equivalent (“BOE”) for the year while International E&P averaged about $5.05 ($4.40 excluding Libya). We continued our emphasis on general and administrative (“G&A”) costs, reducing them by a further 18 percent from 2015 levels. We surpassed the top end of our non-core asset sale guidance range by $300 million through a series of transactions, the largest of which was the divestiture of our Wyoming asset. In addition to the divestitures, we also added a meaningful 61,000 net acre position in the STACK (which abbreviates, Sooner Trend, Anadarko (basin), Canadian (and) Kingfisher (counties)) in 2016 that further enhanced our high quality inventory in our three U.S. resource plays. We executed on all of these fronts in 2016 while ending the year with $2.5 billion in cash and $5.8 billion of total liquidity, strongly positioning the Company to deliver shareholder value in 2017 and beyond. 2016 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS In 2016 and early 2017, the Committee demonstrated its continued commitment to corporate governance and sound compensation practices, further aligning the interests of executive officers with the long-term interests of our stockholders. In recognition of the difficult commodity price environment, the Committee kept NEO base salaries flat in early 2016 (prior to several leadership team changes later in the year), as well as reduced the grant-date value of MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 22 restricted stock awards by 25%.  The Committee also streamlined the Company’s quantitative and qualitative scorecards to enhance linkage between enterprise metrics and Company strategy. Additionally in 2016, we enhanced our stockholder engagement program to solicit valuable feedback from our investors. Overall, stockholders voiced support for our compensation program and provided important insight on program design and disclosure, which we considered thoughtfully when making decisions throughout the year. Based on recent market trends, the Committee also made the decision in early 2017 to modify officer Change in Control (CIC) provisions to better align with competitive practices and recent trends.  Beginning with awards granted in 2018, accelerated vesting of restricted stock and stock options will only occur upon termination without cause or for good reason following a Change in Control (i.e. double-trigger vesting). COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY Our success is based on financial performance and operational results, and we believe that our executive compensation program is an important driver of that success. The primary objectives of our program are to: • Pay for performance. Our program is designed to reward executives for their performance and motivate them to continue to perform at a high level. Cash bonuses based on annual performance, combined with equity awards that vest over several years, balance short-term and long-term business objectives. • Encourage creation of long-term stockholder value. Equity awards and robust stock ownership requirements align our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders. A substantial portion of our NEOs’ long-term incentive awards is comprised of stock options and performance units tied to relative stockholder returns. • Pay competitively. We provide market-competitive pay levels to attract and retain the best talent, and regularly benchmark each component of our pay program, including our benefit programs, to ensure we remain competitive. COMPENSATION GOVERNANCE & BEST PRACTICES The Committee periodically evaluates market best practices in executive compensation and modifies our compensation program as necessary to ensure it continues to provide balanced incentives, while managing compensation risks appropriately in the context of our business objectives. Our program incorporates the following best practices: WHAT WE DO þ Emphasize at-risk compensation designed to link pay to performance þ Engage an independent compensation consultant to advise the Committee þ Maintain stock ownership requirements for officers and directors þ Maintain “double-trigger” change in control cash payments þ Dedicate significant time to robust executive succession planning and leadership development each year þ Offer minimal use of perquisites and no related tax gross-ups WHAT WE DON’T DO ý Grant annual cash bonuses or long-term incentive awards to executive officers that are not subject to clawback 23 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT ý Provide gross-up payments to cover excise taxes for executive officers ý Allow margin, derivative or speculative transactions, such as hedges, pledges and margin accounts, by executive officers ý Reward executives for excessive, inappropriate or unnecessary risk-taking PAY FOR PERFORMANCE Our executive compensation programs deliver payments aligned with performance achieved and are designed in a way that company performance significantly impacts the realizable pay of our NEOs.  As demonstrated in the following graphs, the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to our peers has impacted Mr. Tillman’s pay over time, resulting in realizable pay over the past three years that is in line with the performance of the Company. The value shown (in thousands) as of December 31, 2016 represents the annual base salary, the actual bonus paid for each year’s performance, the year-end value of restricted stock, an updated Black-Scholes valuation of stock options, and an estimated prevailing value of performance awards. The ultimate value of these stock-based awards will depend on our future stock price performance and our total shareholder return relative to industry peers. In combination, the realizable compensation from these awarded opportunities reflects both the Company’s near-term financial and operating successes and the Company’s long-term stock performance. These graphics emphasize that the realizable value of Mr. Tillman’s compensation is significantly aligned with stockholder value creation.  Due to declining commodity prices and the resulting decline in Company share price, 2014 and 2015 show significant decrease from the intended target value of Mr. Tillman’s total compensation.  However, the Company experienced an increase in share price in 2016, and Mr. Tillman’s realizable pay, along with overall stockholder value, benefited from the upturn throughout the year. Values for these illustrations were determined with the following inputs: • Our closing stock price of $17.31 as of December 31, 2016; • An updated Black-Scholes valuation of outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2016; and • Our rank in our TSR peer group as of December 31, 2016 and the corresponding payout percentage as measured under our performance unit programs: 0% for 2014, 0% for 2015, and 67% for 2016. MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 24 HOW WE DETERMINE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMPENSATION COMMITTEE The Committee is responsible for establishing and overseeing executive compensation programs and policies that are consistent with our overall compensation philosophy. In making such decisions, the Committee considers a variety of factors, including stockholder feedback, information provided by its independent compensation consultant, our CEO’s input, Peer Group data, each executive’s experience in the role, Company and individual performance, internal pay equity and any other information the Committee deems relevant in its discretion. STOCKHOLDER OUTREACH The Committee also considers the outcomes of the Company’s advisory stockholder vote on our executive compensation program and any associated stockholder outreach initiatives when making compensation decisions. At our 2016 Annual Meeting, our stockholders expressed support for the Company’s proposals and all of our agenda items were approved.  Within those approvals, over 84% of shares voted in favor of our 2016 “say-on-pay” agenda item. To continue our focus on best practices, we enhanced our stockholder engagement program to solicit valuable feedback from investors which we then shared with the Committee and the Board.  We contacted a broad base of institutional investors and spoke with those interested in meeting and sharing feedback with us.  Overall, investor feedback was positive regarding our executive compensation program and its link between pay and performance. COMPENSATION CONSULTANT For 2016, the Committee directly engaged Meridian Compensation Partners LLC (“Meridian”) as its independent compensation consultant to advise the Committee on executive compensation matters. Meridian provides the Committee with information on industry trends, market practices and legislative issues. Meridian provides no other services to the Company or our executive officers, and the Committee has the right to terminate the services of Meridian and appoint a new compensation consultant at any time. Meridian interacts with several of our officers and employees as necessary. In addition, Meridian may seek input and feedback from members of our management regarding its work product prior to presentation to the Committee to confirm that information is accurate or address other issues. We believe that Meridian provides an independent perspective to the Committee. THE CEO’S ROLE The Committee seeks significant input from the CEO on compensation decisions and performance appraisals for all executive officers other than himself. However, all final compensation decisions for our executive officers are made by the Committee. The CEO does not provide recommendations or participate in Committee discussions concerning his own compensation. 25 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT PEER GROUP Peer group benchmarking is one of several factors the Committee considers in setting pay. Our Peer Group, which is reviewed annually by the Committee, is comprised of the industry companies the Committee believes provide the best external benchmarks for executive compensation and general company performance. In selecting the Peer Group, the Committee considered pertinent financial measures for each company, including market capitalization, assets and revenue, as shown (in millions) in the table below. Market Capitalization Assets Revenue Peer Group 50th Percentile $18,857 $24,346 $5,342 Marathon Oil $12,726 $32,527 $4,279 Our Peer Group reflects the companies against which we compete for executive talent as an independent exploration and production company. 2016 Peer Group Companies Anadarko Petroleum Corporation EOG Resources, Inc. Apache Corporation Hess Corporation Chesapeake Energy Corporation Murphy Oil Corporation ConocoPhillips Co. Noble Energy, Inc. Devon Energy Corporation Occidental Petroleum Corporation Encana Corp. Pioneer Natural Resources Company In 2016, the Committee reviewed the Peer Group and decided not to make changes.  While ConocoPhillips remained a member of the Peer Group for purposes of TSR and company performance, it was not included in compensation benchmarking data for individual officer positions due to its significantly larger market capitalization and size. At the start of 2017, the Committee approved changes to the Peer Group going forward.  To ensure that our Peer Group is most relevant in terms of general size and business scope, ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum were removed, and Continental Resources was added to the Peer Group for purposes of relative TSR and executive compensation benchmarking. COMPENSATION BENCHMARKING PROCESS The Committee conducts an annual comparison of the compensation of our NEOs to the compensation of executives with similar job responsibilities among companies in our Peer Group, based upon information gathered and provided by Meridian. The Committee references this competitive market analysis in making compensation decisions for the coming year. The Committee generally targets executive total direct compensation opportunities at the 50 th percentile of the Peer Group for average performance and adjusts total direct compensation opportunities higher or lower based on the Committee’s assessment of each executive position. We define total direct compensation as the sum of base salary, target annual cash bonus and the intended grant-date value of long-term incentive awards. In October 2016, Meridian provided the Committee a market analysis that included information regarding Peer Group executives’ base salaries, target annual bonus levels and the mix and level of long-term incentives. According to this analysis, NEO compensation levels varied by individual, but were well positioned relative to 50 th percentile benchmarks of comparable roles, averaging 100% of the market 50 th percentile.  The compensation of our CEO was 85% of the market 50 th percentile. MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 26 ELEMENTS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Our executive compensation program includes base salary, annual cash bonuses, long-term incentive awards and other benefits and perquisites. By design, a significant portion of our executive officers’ overall compensation, including annual cash bonuses and long-term incentive awards, is “performance-based,” and the opportunity to earn value is largely dependent on both Company and individual performance. The Committee determines a total compensation opportunity for each executive officer based on a review of competitive market data, a review of our compensation philosophy and the Committee’s subjective judgment. The Committee does not set fixed percentages for each element of compensation, so the mix may change over time as the competitive market moves, governance standards evolve or our business needs change. The following table shows the 2016 pay mix of total target direct compensation components for our NEOs. The allocation of our compensation components, with a significant emphasis on long-term incentive awards, aligns with the practices of our Peer Group. 2016 TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION OVERVIEW The Committee determined 2016 base salaries, target annual cash bonus opportunities and long-term incentive awards in February 2016. The Committee determined the payment of 2016 annual cash bonuses in February 2017, after 2016 business results were known and audited. The following table summarizes the elements of total direct compensation the Committee awarded to our NEOs for 2016 as part of our regular compensation program. The amounts shown differ from the amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table because this table provides the intended value for LTI compensation. Intended value reflects established compensation valuation methodologies that are similar to, but may differ from, the methodologies used for accounting purposes as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. Additionally, this table excludes changes in pension value. 27 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT Name 2016 Year End Base Salary 2016 Bonus Payment (paid in 2017) 2016 LTI Award Intended Value 2016 Total Direct Compensation Mr. Tillman $1,050,000 $1,312,500 $7,076,250 $9,438,750 Mr. Wagner $415,000 $342,380 $925,000 $1,682,380 Mr. Little $600,000 $510,000 $2,035,000 $3,145,000 Ms. Kerrigan $575,000 $488,750 $1,850,000 $2,913,750 Ms. Krajicek $400,000 $300,000 $693,750 $1,393,750 Mr. Sult* $600,000 N/A $2,127,500 $2,727,500 Mr. Robertson* $510,000 N/A $2,035,000 $2,545,000 *The salaries shown for Messrs. Sult and Robertson are their salaries on their last day of employment, August 31, 2016. Note: Messrs. Wagner and Little and Ms. Krajicek received salary increases in conjunction with a reorganization of executive responsibilities occurring in the third quarter of 2016. These salary changes (included above) were not related to the general annual compensation review. BASE SALARY The primary purpose of base salary is to recognize and reward overall responsibilities, experience and established skills. In setting base salary, the Committee compares each NEO’s current salary to the market 50 th percentile, and considers each individual’s experience and expertise, the value and responsibility associated with the role and internal pay equity. The Committee does not use a formula to calculate base salary increases for NEOs. In February 2016, the Committee reviewed base salaries and the considerations noted above.  However, given the current market conditions in the industry, the Committee determined to make no base salary increases for the NEOs at that time. Following our leadership changes and the associated reorganization to reduce our total number of officers in August 2016, the Committee reviewed base salaries in light of the new roles and expanded responsibilities of our NEOs, and as noted above, adjusted the base salaries of Messrs. Wagner and Little and Ms. Krajicek accordingly. Name Base Salary as of January 1, 2016 Base Salary as of March 1, 2016 Base Salary as of January 1, 2017 Mr. Tillman $1,050,000 $1,050,000 $1,050,000 Mr. Wagner $375,000 $375,000 $415,000 Mr. Little $500,000 $500,000 $600,000 Ms. Kerrigan $575,000 $575,000 $575,000 Ms. Krajicek $365,000 $365,000 $400,000 Mr. Sult $600,000 $600,000 N/A Mr. Robertson $510,000 $510,000 N/A ANNUAL CASH BONUS The annual cash bonus rewards executives for achieving short-term financial, operational and strategic goals that drive stockholder value, as well as for individual performance during the year. When determining target bonus opportunities for our executives, the Committee considers the market 50 th percentile, as well as each executive’s experience, relative scope of responsibility and potential, internal pay MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 28 equity considerations and any other information the Committee deems relevant in its discretion. Our targeted performance goals are established to challenge our NEOs to perform at a high level. Payout results may be above or below target based on actual Company and individual performance. The Committee determined the 2016 annual cash bonus payout for each NEO based on its assessment of the following: • Quantitative Company performance goals, established by the Committee during the first quarter of the year, weighted at 70%; • Qualitative organizational and strategic performance goals, established by the Committee during the first quarter of the year, weighted at 30%; and • Individual performance, including achievement of pre-established goals, leadership and ethics, and overall value that the officer created for the Company. The illustration below summarizes the framework the Committee uses to determine individual officer bonus payouts: [ Base Salary x Bonus Target (as % of Base Salary) = Target Bonus Opportunity ] x Company Performance Score 70% Quantitative Performance 30% Organizational / Strategic Performance +/- Individual Performance Adjustment = Annual Bonus Payout The quantitative and qualitative scores can range between 0% and 200% (target is 100%). The final payout for each NEO may be adjusted based on the Committee’s discretionary assessment of the NEO’s individual performance. 2016 QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE METRICS During the first quarter of 2016, the Committee established quantitative performance goals for the bonus program, taking into consideration key financial, safety and operational performance measures that are important indicators of success in our industry. The Company’s business strategy in 2016 addressed the significant decrease in commodity prices, and increased the focus on cost management, efficiencies and balance sheet strength. To align with this strategy, the Company made significant changes in the list and weighting of quantitative bonus metrics. These changes included the addition of a financial metric related to cash margin per BOE and a decreased weighting on exploration & production (“E&P”) production volumes. The Committee also streamlined the quantitative scorecard by removing certain metrics and including them as part of our organizational and strategic objectives. The Committee determined the target level of performance for each metric by evaluating factors such as performance achieved in the immediately preceding year, anticipated challenges for 2016, the business plan and Company strategy. The Committee believes that above-target bonus contributions from the quantitative metrics should be tempered in years when either net earnings or total shareholder returns are negative. In 2016, the Company generated a 30.2% increase in shareholder value, but generated negative net earnings. In early 2017, the Committee evaluated the Company’s 2016 quantitative performance against goals established in early 2016, when commodity prices were at their lowest levels. The Company delivered quantitative results that exceeded those targets in almost every category, including safety, cost management, operating earnings and production. The Committee recognized management’s significant contributions to achieve these outcomes and to steer the Company through a challenging environment. The Committee also exercised discretion to limit the impact of the quantitative out-performance, due to the Company’s negative net earnings. 29 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT The following table shows the targets and weightings established by the Committee and the performance achieved during 2016.

Production denominator is recorded sales adjusted for pricing effects of production sharing contracts, catastrophic events, changes in business climate, acquisitions, and divestitures. This metric excludes Libya and Oil Sands Mining. 2016 ORGANIZATIONAL AND STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE After assessing the Company’s financial and operational performance, the Committee evaluated the organizational and strategic performance achievements, representing 30% of the total bonus award opportunity.  For 2016, the Committee more clearly defined the Company’s qualitative objectives and adopted five metrics to measure organizational and strategic performance: (1) no additional net debt, (2) achievement of our sales target for non-core assets, (3) improvement of one-year relative TSR, (4) resource additions, and (5) no significant spills to the environment. These metrics are evaluated by the Committee to determine whether they have been achieved, but there are generally no threshold or weighting guidelines.  We achieved positive results on all of these metrics except resource replacement. MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 30 Upon review of these qualitative outcomes, the Committee concluded that the Company had achieved overall performance at target expectations. 2016 INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE Although our annual bonus program applies a framework and uses goals and formulas, the Committee maintains discretion to adjust individual cash bonuses to recognize critical performance factors and accomplishments that may not have been fully considered in the performance score calculation. In evaluating our NEOs’ contributions during 2016, the Committee considered each NEO’s specific contribution to our Company’s key achievements, including those discussed under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Summary.” Following this consideration, the Committee determined to make no individual adjustments to the NEOs’ 2016 bonuses, except with respect to Mr. Wagner.  In recognition of Mr. Wagner’s strategic performance in his current role and as interim Chief Financial Officer, the Committee determined that Mr. Wagner’s payout would be paid above target at 110%. ANNUAL CASH BONUS PAYOUTS EARNED FOR 2016 Taking into consideration the Company’s quantitative performance, the Company’s qualitative organizational and strategic performance and individual performance, the Committee determined to assess overall performance under the 2016 bonus program at 100% of target. Base Salary as of December 31, 2016 Bonus Target Target Bonus Opportunity Percent of Target Achieved Actual Bonus Payout Mr. Tillman $1,050,000 125% $1,312,500 100% $1,312,500 Mr. Wagner $415,000 75% $311,250 110% $342,380 Mr. Little $600,000 85% $510,000 100% $510,000 Ms. Kerrigan $575,000 85% $488,750 100% $488,750 Ms. Krajicek $400,000 75% $300,000 100% $300,000 Note: Due to the timing of their separation from the Company, Messrs. Sult and Robertson were not eligible for a 2016 annual cash bonus payment. LONG-TERM INCENTIVES Long-term incentive, or LTI, awards align the interests of NEOs and stockholders over the long term. These awards assist NEOs in establishing and maintaining significant equity ownership and place a meaningful portion of compensation at risk based on our common stock price performance. Long-term incentives also encourage retention through continued service requirements and are intended to represent the largest portion of the NEOs’ total direct compensation. The Committee awards LTIs based on an intended award value that reflects competitive market data, each NEO’s performance and each NEO’s intended target total compensation. The 2016 intended award value for NEOs was allocated 50% to performance units, 20% to stock options and 30% to restricted stock. Each year, the Committee grants LTI awards at its regularly scheduled February meeting, the date of which is generally set at least one year in advance. The grant date for such awards is generally the meeting date; however, for awards approved after market close, the grant date is the next trading day. The actual LTI value realized by each NEO depends on the price of the underlying shares of common stock at the time of vesting or exercise, and in the case of performance units, our TSR relative to that of the companies in our Peer Group. 31 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT 2016 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS After considering competitive market data, the demand for talent, cost considerations and the performance of the Company and the NEOs, the Committee awarded LTIs to each NEO consistent with our normal grant timeline. These grants had a grant date of February 24, 2016. Effective October 1, 2016, the Committee also made an interim award to Mr. Little in conjunction with his acceptance of the role of Executive Vice President, Operations.  This interim award of restricted stock had an intended value of $600,000, which is one times his base salary, and is not included in the amount shown for Mr. Little below. In further recognition of the prevailing economic environment, significantly reduced commodity prices, and the impact on Company stock price, management recommended and the Committee approved a 25% reduction in the grant-date value of NEO restricted stock awards. The table below lists the originally intended grant-date LTI value for each NEO, and the reduced grant-date value that reflects the decrease in restricted stock value. The Committee’s methodologies to deliver intended LTI values are similar to, but can differ from, the methodologies used for accounting purposes as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. See the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table for additional detail about each LTI award. Total 2016 LTI Awards Intended Value Name Annual Target Reduced Grant Mr. Tillman $7,650,000 $7,076,250 Mr. Wagner $1,000,000 $925,000 Mr. Little $2,200,000 $2,035,000 Ms. Kerrigan $2,000,000 $1,850,000 Ms. Krajicek $750,000 $693,750 Mr. Sult $2,300,000 $2,127,500 Mr. Robertson $2,200,000 $2,035,000 PERFORMANCE UNITS The Committee believes that a performance unit program based on TSR relative to peer companies aligns pay and Company performance. The industry peers selected for each performance cycle generally match the industry peers comprising the prevailing Peer Group used for compensation benchmarking. TSR is determined by adding the sum of stock price appreciation or reduction per share, plus cumulative dividends per share for the performance period, and dividing that total by the beginning stock price per share. For purposes of this calculation, the beginning and ending stock prices are the averages of the closing stock prices for the month immediately preceding the beginning and ending dates of the performance period. If the TSR at the end of the performance period is negative, the payout percentage is capped at 100% regardless of ranking. The Committee has discretion to reduce the final payment associated with any performance unit award. Performance units, when earned, are paid in cash. 2016 PERFORMANCE UNITS In February 2016, the Committee awarded the NEOs performance units that will vest based on relative TSR for the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2018. The value of each underlying unit tracks the price of a share of our common stock. The percentage of units earned ranges from 0% to 200% of the units granted. When the award is settled, NEOs will receive dividend equivalents paid in cash for a number of shares equal to the number of units granted, multiplied by the payout percentage. Dividend equivalents accrue and are paid based on performance at the end of the performance period. Earned awards are paid in cash shortly after the completion of the performance period with the final cash value impacted both by relative TSR rank and our common stock price. In the event that any companies in our Peer Group undergo a change in corporate capitalization or a MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 32 corporate transaction during the performance period, the Committee may evaluate whether such company will be replaced in the Peer Group. The Committee has designated Southwestern Energy, Continental Resources and Concho Resources as replacement companies (in that order). The payout percentages for each ranking are: MRO TSR Ranking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Payout (% of Target) 200% 183% 167% 150% 133% 117% 100% 83% 67% 50% 0% 0% 0% 2015 PERFORMANCE UNITS The performance units granted in February 2015 have a performance period end date of December 31, 2017 and follow the same payout percentages based on ranking as the 2016 performance units (listed above). See the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2016 Fiscal Year-End Table for information about the estimated payouts of the 2015 performance units. 2014 PERFORMANCE UNITS The performance units granted in February 2014 had a performance period end date of December 31, 2016. The payout percentages for each ranking are: MRO TSR Ranking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Payout (% of Target) 200% 182% 164% 145% 127% 109% 91% 73% 54% 0% 0% 0% For the performance period, we ranked eleventh out of twelve companies. In January 2017, the Committee determined that there would be no final payout for the 2014 Performance Units. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options provide a direct link between officer compensation and the value delivered to stockholders. The Committee believes that stock options are inherently performance-based, as option holders only realize compensation if the value of our stock increases following the grant date. Stock options granted according to our normal annual grant timeline generally have a three-year pro-rata vesting period and a maximum term of ten years. Additional information on these awards, including the number of shares subject to each award, is shown in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. RESTRICTED STOCK The Committee awards restricted stock for diversification of the LTI award mix, for consistent alignment between executives and stockholders, and for retention purposes. Restricted stock provides recipients with the opportunity for capital accumulation and a more predictable long-term incentive value than is provided by performance units or stock options. Restricted stock awarded according to our normal annual grant schedule typically vests in full on the third anniversary of the grant date. Prior to vesting, restricted stock recipients have the right to vote and receive dividends on the restricted shares. OTHER BENEFITS PERQUISITES We offer limited perquisites to our NEOs. We believe these perquisites are reasonable, particularly because the cost of these benefits constitutes a small percentage of each NEO’s total compensation. The Committee assesses these perquisites at least annually as part of its total competitive review. We do not provide any tax gross-ups on 33 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT these perquisites. The perquisites provided to our NEOs include reimbursement for certain tax, estate, and financial planning services up to $15,000 per year, an enhanced annual physical examination, limited personal use of Company aircraft and a Company-provided car service for our CEO. Our NEOs also participate in the health, retirement and other benefit plans generally available to our U.S. employees. See the “All Other Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table and the footnotes following the Summary Compensation Table for additional details concerning the perquisites provided to our NEOs in 2016. RETIREMENT BENEFITS We offer our NEOs the opportunity to provide for retirement through four plans. • Marathon Oil Company Thrift Plan (“Thrift Plan”) – A tax-qualified 401(k) plan. • Retirement Plan of Marathon Oil Company (“Retirement Plan”) – A tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. • Excess Benefit Plan (“Excess Plan”) – A nonqualified plan allowing employees to accrue benefits above the tax limits, with components attributable to both the Retirement Plan and the Thrift Plan. • Marathon Oil Company Deferred Compensation Plan (“Deferred Compensation Plan”) – A nonqualified plan that grows when an NEO accrues benefits above the tax limits in the Thrift Plan or when an NEO defers a portion of his or her compensation. Benefits payable under our qualified and nonqualified plans are described in more detail in “Post-Employment Benefits” and “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.” We also sponsor retiree medical plans for a broad-based group of employees, including the NEOs. The Committee has determined that providing these arrangements plays a meaningful role in attracting and retaining qualified employees and executives. SEVERANCE BENEFITS Our NEOs do not have employment agreements entitling them to any special executive severance payments, other than the change in control termination benefits described below. The Board may exercise discretion to make severance payments to executives on a case-by-case basis. We have a policy requiring that our Board seek stockholder approval or ratification of certain severance agreements, including agreements providing change in control benefits for senior executive officers that would require payment of cash severance benefits exceeding 2.99 times the officer’s salary plus the most recent annual cash bonus paid. We believe change in control benefits are necessary to attract and retain talent within our industry, ensure continuity of management in the event of a change in control and provide our NEOs with the security to make decisions that are in the best interests of our stockholders. Our change in control benefits are described in more detail under “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control.” STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS AND ANTI-HEDGING & ANTI-PLEDGING POLICIES All of our officers who are “executive officers” for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act are subject to our stock ownership requirements, which are intended to reinforce the alignment of interests between our officers and stockholders. The stock ownership requirements are as follows: MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 34 • CEO – six times base salary; • Executive Vice Presidents – four times base salary; and • Vice Presidents – two times base salary. Executive officers have five years from their respective appointment dates to achieve the designated stock ownership level. The Committee reviews each executive officer’s progress toward the requirements on at least an annual basis to determine whether the market value of shares, including the value of unvested shares not subject to performance conditions, satisfies our requirements. Executive officers who do not hold the required level of stock ownership are expected to hold the shares they receive upon vesting of restricted stock or exercise of stock options (after payment of exercise prices and after taxes) until they have met their requirement. Each NEO other than Ms. Kerrigan is currently within the five year window. To ensure that they bear the full risks of stock ownership, officers are prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions related to our stock. Officers are also prohibited from pledging or creating a security interest in any shares of our common stock they hold, including shares in excess of the applicable ownership requirement. TAX CONSIDERATIONS The Committee considers the tax effects to the Company and the NEOs when making executive compensation decisions to deliver compensation in a tax-efficient manner. However, the Committee’s priority is to provide performance-based and competitive compensation. Therefore, some compensation paid to NEOs is not deductible due to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. As required under Section 162(m), our stockholders approved the material terms of performance goals for awards to NEOs, which are contained in our 2012 and 2016 Incentive Compensation Plans. These performance goals include both financial and operational measures. For purposes of qualifying annual cash bonus payments to our NEOs as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) in 2016, we used both financial and operational goals to establish maximum potential payment amounts. The determination of actual annual cash bonus payments for NEOs is described above under “Annual Cash Bonus.”  Performance units and stock options are also performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m). 35 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The following table summarizes the total compensation for each NEO for the years shown.

(2)    This column reflects the aggregate grant date fair values calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States regarding stock compensation. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in footnote 21 to our consolidated financial statements in our annual reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and footnote 20 to our consolidated financial statements in our annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. For 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Stock Awards column also includes the grant date fair value of the share-denominated performance units granted in February 2014, February 2015 and February 2016 respectively, which ultimately will be settled in cash. The value ultimately realized by the officers upon the actual vesting of the awards may or may not be equal to this determined value, as these awards are subject to market conditions and have been valued based on an assessment of the market conditions as of the grant date. See the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table” and “Long-Term Incentive Awards” for further detail on our performance unit program. (3)    This column reflects annual cash bonus payments, determined by the Compensation Committee and paid in the following February respectively, pursuant to the Company’s Annual Cash Bonus Plan. These awards are discussed in further detail under “Annual Cash Bonus.” The amounts shown in this column also reflect the vested value of performance units earned by our NEOs during the performance period that ended on December 31, 2014. In 2013, we changed the design of our MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 36 performance units which resulted in reporting performance unit values in the Stock Awards column as of the date granted instead of Non-Equity Incentive column as of the date earned. This means an NEO could show performance unit values in both columns during the overlapping 3 year vesting period. For 2014, the only NEO whose performance unit value appears in both columns is Ms. Kerrigan. (4)    This column reflects the annual change in accumulated benefits under our retirement plans. See “Post-Employment Benefits” for more information about our defined benefit plans and the assumptions used in calculating these amounts. No deferred compensation earnings are reported in this column because our non-qualified deferred compensation plans do not provide above-market or preferential earnings.

(b)    All regular employees in the United States, including our NEOs, are eligible to receive annual physical and wellness incentives. However, officers may receive an enhanced physical under the executive physical program. This column reflects the average incremental cost of the executive physical program over the employee physical program. Due to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act confidentiality requirements, we do not disclose actual use of this program by individual officers. (c)    This column reflects reimbursement for professional advice related to tax, estate, and financial planning. The maximum annual benefit is $15,000, and reimbursements are attributed to the calendar year in which services are performed. Due to processing delays, the actual amount reimbursed to an officer may exceed $15,000 in a given year. (d)    This column reflects access to a Company-provided car service for Mr. Tillman as business needs dictate.  This benefit is offered to Mr. Tillman to allow the efficient use of his time and to provide safe transportation given the demands of his role, including travel, after hours/weekend obligations and extended work hours.  We provide access to this benefit because we believe that the cost is outweighed by the convenience, increased safety and efficiency that it offers. (e)    This column reflects amounts contributed by us under the Thrift Plan and related non-qualified deferred compensation plans. See “Post-Employment Benefits” and “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation” for more information about the non-qualified plans.

POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Marathon Oil offers NEOs the opportunity to save for retirement as follows: • Marathon Oil Company Thrift Plan (“Thrift Plan”): A tax-qualified 401(k) plan that currently provides for company matching contributions of up to 7% of eligible earnings. • Retirement Plan of Marathon Oil Company (“Retirement Plan”): A tax qualified defined benefit pension plan. • Excess Benefit Plan (“Excess Plan”): A nonqualified plan. The defined benefit portion allows participants to accrue benefits above the defined benefit tax limits, and the defined contribution portion allows participants to accrue benefits above the defined contribution tax limits. • Marathon Oil Company Deferred Compensation Plan (“Deferred Compensation Plan”): A nonqualified plan allowing participants to defer a portion of their compensation and accrue benefits above the Thrift Plan tax limits. All plans have a three-year vesting requirement for company contributions. All NEOs have met the vesting requirement. See “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation” below for additional information on the Deferred Compensation Plan and the defined contribution portion of the Excess Plan. MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 42 RETIREMENT PLAN In general, all regular full-time and part-time employees in the United States are eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan as of their date of hire. Benefit accruals are determined under a cash-balance formula, under which plan participants receive pay credits each year equal to a percentage of eligible compensation based on their plan points. Plan points equal the sum of a participant’s age and cash-balance service. Participants with fewer than 50 points receive a 7% pay credit percentage; participants with 50 to 69 points receive a 9% pay credit percentage; and participants with 70 or more points receive an 11% pay credit percentage. Participants are also credited with interest at a rate based on the 30-year Treasury rate with a 3.00% minimum, which in 2016 was 3.00%. For 2016, Mr. Little and Ms. Kerrigan received a pay credit equal to 11% of compensation. Ms. Krajicek and Messrs. Tillman, Wagner and Sult received pay credits equal to 9% of compensation, and Mr. Robertson received a pay credit equal to 7% of compensation. Participants who began employment prior to January 1, 2010 also have a portion of their benefit calculated under a legacy final average pay formula, which is referred to as the Legacy formula. Mr. Little, Ms. Kerrigan and Ms. Krajicek are the only NEOs with a Legacy benefit. Up to 37.5 years of participation may be recognized under the formula, and only service earned prior to January 1, 2010 is recognized. Eligible earnings under the Retirement Plan primarily include base salary and annual cash bonuses (including Thrift Plan deferrals but excluding amounts deferred under our nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan). Long-term incentive compensation is not included. Final average pay was frozen as of July 6, 2015, but vesting service and age continue to be updated under the Legacy formula. The monthly benefit under the Legacy formula is calculated as follows: [ 1.6% x Final Average Pay x Years of Participation ] - [ 1.33% x Estimated Primary SS Benefit x Years of Participation ] Normal retirement age under the Retirement Plan is age 65. However, retirement-eligible participants are able to retire and receive an unreduced benefit under the Legacy formula upon reaching age 62. Retirement Plan benefits include various annuity options and a lump sum distribution option. Participants are eligible for early retirement subsidies under the Legacy formula upon reaching age 50 and completing ten years of vesting service. Each of Mr. Little, Ms. Kerrigan and Ms. Krajicek are eligible for early retirement subsidies. We have not granted years of service in addition to the service recognized under the terms of our qualified retirement plans (applicable to a broad-based group of employees) to any NEO for purposes of retirement benefit accruals. EXCESS PLAN – DEFINED BENEFIT PORTION The Excess Plan for certain highly compensated employees, including our NEOs, provides benefits that participants would have received under our tax-qualified Retirement Plan but for certain Internal Revenue Code limitations. Eligible compensation under the Excess Plan includes deferred compensation contributions made by NEOs. The Excess Plan also provides an enhancement for officers based on the three highest bonuses earned during their last ten years of employment, instead of the consecutive bonus formula in place for non-officers. Distributions under the Excess Plan are paid in a lump sum following separation from service. 43 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT PENSION BENEFITS TABLE The following table shows the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits payable to each NEO under the Retirement Plan and the defined benefit portion of the Excess Plan as of December 31, 2016.

NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION We offer certain employees, including our NEOs, the opportunity to accrue benefits equal to the Company matching contributions they would have received under the Thrift Plan but for certain Internal Revenue Code limitations. Officers generally accrue these benefits in the Deferred Compensation Plan, while other employees accrue such benefits in the defined contribution portion of the Excess Plan. Both plans have a three year vesting requirement for Company contributions. All NEOs have met the vesting requirement. Distributions from the Deferred Compensation Plan and the Excess Plan are paid as a lump sum following separation from service. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified plan into which a participant may elect to defer up to 20% of his or her salary and bonus each year. One NEO, Mr. Wagner, elected to defer compensation for 2016. Participants are fully vested in their own deferrals under the plan. Additionally, participants can receive company contributions into the plan equal to the maximum potential matching contribution under the Thrift Plan after they have reached defined contribution accruals under the Thrift Plan in excess of tax limits. The investment options available under the Deferred Compensation Plan generally mirror the core investment options available under the Thrift Plan, except for Marathon Oil common stock, which is not available under the Deferred Compensation Plan. MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 44 EXCESS PLAN – DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PORTION Prior to becoming eligible for participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan, NEOs may have received defined contribution accruals under the Excess Plan. These contributions were available after a participant’s Thrift Plan contributions were limited due to tax requirements and equaled the matching contribution that participants would have received under the Thrift Plan but for limits imposed by tax law. Defined contribution accruals in the Excess Plan are credited with interest equal to that paid in the “Marathon Oil Stable Value Fund” option of the Marathon Oil Company Thrift Plan. The annual rate of return on this option for 2016 was 2.05%. NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION TABLE The following table shows each NEO’s accumulated benefits under our nonqualified savings and deferred compensation plans for 2016.

The remaining amount reflects compensation from 2016 that he elected to defer. (3)   The amount shown is due to Mr. Robertson’s election to defer a portion of his 2015 bonus, which was payable in 2016. POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL As a matter of policy, we do not enter into employment, severance, or change in control agreements with our NEOs. Rather, we provide an Executive Change in Control Severance Benefits Plan, which is described in more detail below. RETIREMENT OR SEPARATION Upon retirement or separation, our NEOs are entitled to receive their vested benefits that have accrued under our broad-based and executive benefit programs. For more information see “Post-Employment Benefits” and “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.” If an NEO retires, meaning the NEO separates employment after attaining age 50 with at least ten years of vesting service, unvested stock options granted prior to July 30, 2014 become immediately vested while unvested stock 45 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT options granted July 30, 2014 and later are forfeited. Unvested restricted stock awards are forfeited upon retirement (except in the case of mandatory retirement at age 65). Unvested performance units are forfeited upon retirement unless the NEO has worked more than half of the performance period, in which case awards may be vested on a prorated basis at the Committee’s discretion. Of the NEOs, only Mr. Little, Ms. Kerrigan and Ms. Krajicek are currently retirement eligible. DEATH OR DISABILITY In the event of death or disability, our NEOs (or the beneficiary or estate, as defined by the plan terms) would be entitled to vested benefits accrued under our broad-based and executive benefits programs. Long-term incentive awards would immediately vest in full upon the death of an NEO, with performance units vesting at the target level. In the event of disability, long-term incentive awards would continue to vest as if the NEO remained actively employed for up to 24 months during the period of disability. CHANGE IN CONTROL To encourage our NEOs to continue their dedication to their assigned duties where a change in control of the Company is under consideration, our Executive Change in Control Severance Benefits Plan (the “Change in Control Plan”) provides severance benefits if employment is terminated under certain circumstances following a change in control or during a potential change in control. Under the Change in Control Plan, a change in control will have occurred if: • any person not affiliated with Marathon Oil acquires 20% or more of the voting power of our outstanding securities; • our Board no longer has a majority comprised of (1) individuals who were directors on the effective date of the plan and (2) new directors (other than directors who join our Board in connection with an election contest) approved by two-thirds of the directors then in office who (a) were directors on the effective date of the plan or (b) were themselves previously approved by our Board in this manner; • we merge with another company and, as a result, our stockholders hold less than 50% of the surviving entity’s voting power immediately after the transaction; • our stockholders approve a plan of complete liquidation of Marathon Oil; or • we sell all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, our Change in Control Plan provides severance benefits to executives who are terminated following the occurrence of specified events (defined in the Plan as a potential change in control) that suggest that a change in control is likely to occur. If an NEO is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason following a change in control or during a potential change in control, he or she will be entitled to the following: • a cash payment of up to three times the sum of the NEO’s current salary on the termination date plus the average bonus awarded to the NEO in the three years before the termination or change in control (or during the period of employment if less than three years); • life and health insurance benefits for up to 36 months after termination, at the lesser of the current cost or the active employee cost; • an additional three years of service credit and three years of age credit for purposes of retiree health and life insurance benefits; • a cash payment equal to the difference between the amount receivable under our defined contribution plan and the amount which would have been received if the NEO’s savings had been fully vested; MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 46 • a cash payment equal to the actuarial equivalent of the difference between the amounts receivable by the NEO under the final average pay formula in our pension plans and the amounts which would be payable if (a) the NEO had an additional three years of participation service credit, (b) the NEO’s final average pay would be the higher of salary at the time of the change in control event or termination plus his or her highest annual bonus from the preceding three years, (c) for purposes of determining early retirement commencement factors, the NEO had three additional years of vesting service credit and three additional years of age, and (d) the NEO’s pension had been fully vested; and • a cash payment equal to the difference between the amount receivable under our defined benefit plan and the amount which would have been received if the NEO’s savings had been fully vested. These benefits are not payable if the termination is for cause or due to mandatory retirement, death, disability or resignation (other than for good reason) by the NEO. The program includes no provisions to reimburse or “gross up” tax obligations following a change in control. Immediately upon a change in control or upon an NEO’s termination of employment during a potential change in control, unvested stock options and restricted stock vest in full. If a change in control occurs prior to the end of a performance period, unvested performance units vest in full as follows: • performance units granted prior to 2015 vest at the target level; and • performance units granted after 2014 will vest at the applicable performance percentage based on Marathon Oil’s actual relative TSR ending on the day immediately prior to the date of the change of control. The Change in Control Plan will continue in effect during a potential change in control period and for two years after a change in control. We have a policy that our Board will seek stockholder approval or ratification of any severance agreement for a senior executive officer (other than agreements under our Change in Control Plan) that generally requires payment of cash severance benefits exceeding 2.99 times a senior executive officer’s salary plus the most recent annual cash bonus paid. The following tables assume a termination date or change in control date of December 31, 2016, the last business day of 2016. The value of the equity awards (accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards, stock options and performance unit awards) was calculated using the December 31, 2016 closing market price for our common stock ($17.31). The value of performance unit awards assumes that the 2015 and 2016 Performance Units would vest and be paid out at target.

MARATHON OIL | 2017 PRO XY STATEMENT 48 TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS We have written procedures for monitoring, reviewing, approving or ratifying related person transactions. We will enter into or ratify related person transactions only when the Board, acting through the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, determines that the related person transaction is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The primary features of these procedures are: • Each director and executive officer must submit a list of his or her immediate family members, each listed individual’s employer and job title, each firm, corporation or other entity in which such individual is a director, executive officer, partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a five percent or greater beneficial ownership interest, and any profit, non-profit charitable or trade organization for which such individual is actively involved in fundraising or otherwise serves as a director, trustee or in a similar capacity. • The Company maintains a list, to the extent the information is publicly available, of five percent beneficial owners, including (a) if the owner is an individual, the same information requested of directors and executive officers as noted above, and (b) if the owner is a firm, corporation or other entity, a list of principals or executive officers of the firm, corporation or entity. • The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers the facts and circumstances of each related person transaction and determines whether to approve it. • Any pending or ongoing related person transaction is submitted to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or Committee Chair, which will consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances. Based on the conclusions reached, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or the Committee Chair evaluates all options, including ratification, amendment or termination of the related person transaction. • The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee annually reviews any previously approved or ratified related person transaction with a remaining term of more than six months or remaining amounts payable to or receivable from the Company of more than $120,000. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, taking into consideration the Company’s contractual obligations, the Committee determines whether it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to continue, modify or terminate the transaction. During 2016, there were no transactions in excess of $120,000 between the Company and a related person in which the related person had a direct or indirect material interest. 49 MARATHON OIL | 2017 PROXY STATEMENT PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR FOR 2017 The Audit and Finance Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the Company’s financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for 2017.
