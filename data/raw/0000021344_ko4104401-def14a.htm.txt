Table of Contents 2 “ Our vision as a Company is to achieve top-quartile growth and to pursue a total beverage company ambition. ” 2 Letter from Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer TO MY FELLOW SHAREOWNERS: On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Coca-Cola
                           team, thank you for your investment. In 2022, we delivered strong results. We were able to do this
        because we focused intensely on the needs of our consumers. Whether times are good or difficult, staying close to consumers
        is vital to our success. We faced many challenges during 2022, from the ongoing impact
        of the pandemic to war to global inflationary pressures. We begin 2023 focused on what we can control, including providing
        great products for consumers. This focus has guided us successfully through our long history. And it will guide us
        into the future. The opportunities we see The Coca-Cola Company’s purpose is to refresh the world
        and make a difference. This clear purpose has helped us navigate challenges these past few years. Our vision as a Company is to achieve top-quartile growth and
        to pursue a total beverage company ambition. Our ambition is unchanging, as it rests on optimism about our industry and
        the Company’s future. Developed markets account for about 20% of the world’s population.
        About two-thirds of what people in those markets drink is a commercially made beverage. But our market share of those beverages is
                           in the mid-teens. This means we have an enormous opportunity to develop more commercial drinks in developed
                           markets and to continue gaining share. Developing and emerging markets represent about 80% of the world’s
        population. There, only about a third of beverage consumption is in commercial beverages, and our market share is only
        in the mid-single digits. Simply put, we see vast, long-term potential to build our business,
        no matter where we operate. The relevance of our brands You probably know some of the cornerstones of Coke’s history.
        Coca-Cola was introduced in 1886 at a soda fountain in Atlanta and has grown to become a global brand available in more
        than 200 countries and territories. So why does Coke remain Coke? Importantly, each generation of our Company has worked to make
        Coke relevant to the next generation of consumers. If they hadn’t done this, some other brand might have supplanted
        Coke as the market leader. The work of maintaining and building brand relevancy is never-ending,
        and that is because consumers are constantly changing. Marketing must change with them, whether in tone and style or because
        of the evolution of media. Table of Contents 3 “We are now faster with innovations,
faster in stopping things that don’t work, and faster in breaking down barriers to progress.” Not
                                         so long ago, Diet Coke was bold, even outrageous – an idea introduced via a stage
                                         show and television commercials. Today, our marketing – including for Diet Coke
                                         – is far different but no less bold in its ambitions. We are driving the most radical marketing transformation in our
        history. We’ve shaped a focused portfolio. Our engagement with consumers
        is digital-first. We’ve moved away from focusing on broadcast TV ads to creating immersive experiences, which includes
        working with influencers to reach consumers. Innovation is essential, but it’s not merely about expansion
        – it is about discipline. We ask: What interests the consumer? What is the growth potential of a product for our
        business? Can we be competitive, including creating value for our bottling system and customers? Sometimes, we move beyond our traditional boundaries. For example,
        we’ve launched Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola as a ready-to-drink cocktail through a relationship with
        Brown-Forman. While it’s early days, this stands out as one example of our ongoing journey to seek ways to bring
        Coke to consumers in new and dynamic ways. Sustainability and our business As we shape our enterprise for the future, we do so with sustainability
        as a foundation. And I use the term sustainability in the broadest sense – it includes all the ways we build resilience
        into our business to bolster our growth and create positive changes in the world. We focus
                                         on water, packaging and climate challenges in our business and communities. These are
                                         interconnected issues, and so are the solutions we support. While there is much we can do as a Company, we can do even more
        by working with industry partners, nonprofits, governments and other stakeholders. Collective action creates a more significant
        impact. We start with water because it’s essential to people and
        ecosystems and is also the main ingredient in our products. We aspire to give back more water to nature and communities than
        we use in manufacturing our beverages. We’re focused on remaining water-neutral and improving water security where
        it’s needed most. We design our packaging to enable a circular economy. Our World
        Without Waste strategy – which is now five years old – includes a goal to recover a bottle or can for every
        one we sell by 2030 and then to recycle and reuse it. We are focused on reaching 100% collection rates and increasing
        recycled content in our packaging toward a 50% goal by 2030, as well as striving to make at least 25% of our packaging
        reusable by 2030. Our work in water and packaging also has impacts on our climate
        goals. We’ve used a science-based approach to set targets and actions to reduce our carbon footprint significantly.
        For example, our investments in water replenishment create benefits in ecosystem biodiversity, carbon sequestration and
        resilience, which help our business and communities adapt to climate change. What
                                         we’re doing in sustainability is centered on what consumers care about and also
                                         on our business priorities. We will have a great business if we help fix some of the
                                         problems the world faces. Leadership for the future Finally, I want to thank the people of our Company and system.
        They successfully worked to navigate many challenges in 2022, and they will continue to do so in 2023 and beyond. We’ve announced a number of changes in our leadership teams
        over the past six months to support the Company’s continued growth. This is an evolution – our business has
        been successful because we continue to change. There’s never going to be a perfect organization. It is
        wrong to expect an organizational structure to solve everything. Culture matters, mindset matters, and having the right

alignment allowed us to deliver robust growth. We also continued to invest to enhance our capabilities. We executed more efficiently
and effectively on a local level, while maintaining flexibility on a global level. We remained committed to driving growth across
our business and delivering on our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference through three connected pillars. Highlights
of these pillars from 2022 include the following: LOVED

    SUSTAINABLY FOR
    A BETTER SHARED FUTURE ● We
                                         gained value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, driven by share gains in
                                         both at-home and away-from-home channels ● We
        delivered robust unit case volume growth of 5%, balanced across developed, developing and emerging markets as well as

        emerging markets ● We
        have continued our test-and-learn approach since entering the ready-to-drink alcohol category in 2018 with Lemon-Dou
        in Japan. Our portfolio of brands in this category now includes Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, Schweppes premium drinks, Simply
        Spiked and Fresca Mixed. In November 2022, we debuted Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola in Mexico ● We

        by 2030 ● We
        joined industry groups to advocate for government authorization in various markets of food grade standards for recycled
        plastic and to support well-designed plastic recycling programs and infrastructure ● We
        returned more than 100% of the water used in our finished beverages to nature and communities ● We
        drove growth of our low- and no-calorie beverages and provided smaller package choices to enable consumers to manage sugar
        intake. Approximately two-thirds of the products in our portfolio have less than 100 calories per 12-ounce serving ● We
        released our fourth combined Business & ESG Report, continuing our history of assuring select sustainability
        metrics while also providing key public disclosures against the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures recommendations,
        as well as other reporting frameworks such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the Global Reporting Initiative
        and the UN Global Compact ● We
        demonstrated effective execution of our strategy across operating segments, with strong net operating revenue growth of
        11% ● We
        leveraged our networked structure to be more agile and more efficiently invest resources, leading to an increase in gross
        profit per advertising spend ● We

        in Cambodia and announced the refranchising of Company-owned bottling operations in Vietnam, both to Swire Coca-Cola Limited.
        We also sold our equity stake in the bottler in Egypt to Coca-Cola HBC AG ● We
        remained disciplined with respect to capital allocation priorities as we balanced increased reinvestment in our business
        while growing our dividend by approximately 5% in 2022 Table of Contents 6 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Human Capital Our people and culture agendas are critical business priorities,
and we strive to be a global employer of choice that attracts and retains high-performing talent with the passion, skills and
mindsets to drive us on our journey to refresh the world and make a difference. We are committed to building an equitable and
inclusive culture that inspires and supports the growth of our employees, serves our communities and shapes a strong and more
sustainable business. OUR HUMAN CAPITAL PILLARS Leadership, Talent
    and Development Our strategy is anchored in helping all employees grow and thrive
    within, and beyond, the Coca-Cola system. We are prioritizing development, increasing transparency, and introducing more flexibility
    and choice to help employees achieve their career aspirations and to build a more agile, productive and empowered workforce.
    We focus on hiring and developing capable and diverse talent that mirrors the markets we serve, along with investing in inspirational
    leadership, providing learning opportunities, and building capabilities that equip our global workforce with the skills they
    need, all of which enhance and improve engagement and retention. We support all employees as leaders to be role models, to
    set the agenda for themselves and their teams, and to help people develop and grow – creating an environment for everyone
    to thrive. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion We believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that
    mirrors the markets we serve is a strategic business priority that is critical to the Company’s success. We take a comprehensive
    view of diversity and inclusion across different races, ethnicities, tribes, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, generations,
    abilities and expressions of gender and sexual identity. We continue to invest our resources into strategies and initiatives
    that create a more equitable and inclusive environment. Human Rights Respect for human rights is a fundamental value of our Company. We
    strive to align our policies and practices with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights across our value chain.
    We aim to meaningfully improve the lives we touch around the world. Culture and Engagement Each employee, leader and function across our Company contributes
    to our growth culture, which is grounded in our Company’s purpose. Our leaders are the stewards of culture change. We
    focus on four key growth behaviors –being curious, empowered, inclusive and agile – and we value how we work as
    much as what we achieve. Through our behaviors, actions and outcomes, we embody and shape the culture of the Company. We believe
    our culture enables our Company’s business strategy and shapes employee experiences. Business Integrity Our Codes of Business Conduct are grounded in our commitment to do
    the right thing. They serve as the foundation of our approach to ethics and compliance, and our anti-corruption compliance

    and culture, including diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”). See page 31 for information regarding the
    Board’s oversight of human capital. Table of Contents 7 GLOBAL DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION STRATEGY We believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that mirrors
the markets we serve is a strategic business priority and critical to the Company’s success. We continue to advance
our DEI initiatives inside our Company as well as in the communities we call home. We have developed our DEI plans with permanence
in mind, while being open to evolving our plans as we continue to make progress toward our aspirations. Our DEI strategy comprises three long-term ambitions: 1 Create a workforce that mirrors the markets we serve 2 Enable an inclusive culture where our employees thrive 3 Advance equity within our business, communities and the marketplace In 2022, we continued to pursue these ambitions by: Table of Contents 8 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Sustainability Our sustainability goals are embedded in how we operate as a business.
Our sustainability strategies enable the Company to proactively respond to consumer preferences and address emerging challenges,
building greater resilience in our business to withstand future changes. In everything we do, we aim to create a more sustainable
business and better shared future that make a difference in people’s lives, the communities we serve and the planet. We
recognize that the sustainability of our business is directly linked to the communities and ecosystems in which we operate, and
that is why our approach is guided by our purpose: to refresh the world and make a difference. Our sustainability priorities cover the following areas: water stewardship;
reducing added sugar; packaging; climate; sustainable agriculture; and people and communities. Through internal and external stakeholder
engagement, we have identified the highest-priority issues for the Company, allowing us to grow our business while mitigating
risk. Working collaboratively with our bottling partners and stakeholders at every stage of our value chain, we look to integrate
sustainability considerations into our daily actions. Water
    Stewardship We strive to replenish water back to nature
    and communities, improve efficiency and treat wastewater to high standards. Our ability to grow our business as well as
    communities’ capacity to thrive depends on access to clean water resources. We know local water resources are impacted
    by changing weather patterns and climate change. That is why our 2030 Water Security Strategy seeks to build greater resilience
    in the watersheds where scarcity impacts our business, supply chain and communities. Reducing
    Added Sugar We are building a total beverage company, which includes offering
    more choices with less sugar, reducing packaging sizes and providing clear nutrition information. We are listening
    to consumers, and we understand that people around the world have an increased interest in managing the foods and beverages
    they consume. Within our portfolio of brands, we are taking action to reduce added sugar by offering consumers more choices
    with less added sugar, reducing packaging sizes to enable portion control, and promoting our low- and no-calorie beverages,
    all while responsibly marketing our products and providing clear nutrition information so our consumers can make informed
    choices. Packaging Our vision is to make packaging part of a circular economy, thereby
    keeping it out of landfills and our environment. Our World Without Waste program focuses on creating a circular
    economy for our packaging materials, which means designing waste out and ensuring that our packages are reused and recycled.
    By using more recycled content, developing plant-based materials, lightweighting our packages and expanding our refillable
    business model while increasing collection of empty bottles, we are reducing emissions and delivering against both our climate
    and waste reduction goals since packaging accounts for approximately 30% of our overall carbon footprint. Climate We look for ways to reduce carbon emissions across the Coca-Cola
    value chain. We are reducing carbon emissions across our system by interconnecting our sustainability goals across the
    Coca-Cola system and value chain. After achieving our 2020 “drink in your hand” goal to reduce relative carbon
    emissions by 25% against a 2010 baseline, we have taken it a step further and set a science-based target to reduce greenhouse
    gas emissions by 25% across the entire value chain by 2030 as compared to a 2015 baseline. Sustainable
    Agriculture Our goal is to source our priority ingredients sustainably. The
    agricultural ingredients we use to produce our beverages require significant water resources, produce greenhouse gases, and
    involve millions of farmers in their value chains. By working with our suppliers to reduce water use, implement regenerative
    farm practices that protect land and watersheds and ensuring that our Supplier Guiding Principles are being respected, we
    are enabling the natural ecosystem to sequester carbon – all while building resilience to temperature changes and enabling
    economic empowerment for rural communities. People &
    Communities We aim to improve people’s lives and create a better shared
    future for our communities and the planet. From ingredient sourcing to packaging recovery to creating local economic
    opportunities, we strive to create shared value through growth, with an ongoing focus on building inclusion and increasing
    people’s access to equal opportunities. To learn more about the Company’s sustainability efforts, including
our comprehensive goals, please view our Business & Sustainability Report on the Company’s website, by visiting www.coca-colacompany.com/sustainability. The
    Board, through the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, oversees the Company’s sustainability strategies
    and initiatives, including the Company’s short- and long-term goals. See page 31 for information regarding the
    Board’s oversight of sustainability matters. Table of Contents 9 4 Voting Roadmap 1 Election of Directors The Board of Directors and the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee believe that the 13 Director nominees possess the necessary
qualifications and experiences to provide quality advice and counsel to the Company’s management and effectively oversee the business
and the long-term interests of shareowners. Our Board recommends a vote FOR each Director nominee See page 12 for further information 2 Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation The
    Company seeks a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of its Named Executive Officers as described in the Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 53 and the Compensation Tables beginning on page 70 . Our Board recommends a vote FOR this item See page 50 for further information 3 Advisory Vote on the
                                                         Frequency of Future Advisory Votes to Approve Executive Compensation Shareowners are being provided the opportunity to vote on how often they believe we should hold an advisory vote to approve executive
compensation in the future. The frequency options are to hold the advisory vote to approve executive compensation each year, every two
years or every three years. The Board believes that an annual advisory vote on executive compensation is the most appropriate policy for
our shareowners and the Company at this time, which is consistent with current practice. Our Board recommends a vote for ONE YEAR See page 91 for further information 4 Ratification of the
                                                                            Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Independent Auditors The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee believe that the retention of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Independent Auditors
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 is in the best interests of the Company and its shareowners. As a matter of good corporate
governance, shareowners are being asked to ratify the Audit Committee’s selection of the Independent Auditors. Our Board recommends a vote FOR this item See page 95 for further information 5-9 Shareowner Proposals Five proposals were submitted by shareowners: ● Proposal
                                         requesting an audit of the Company’s impact on nonwhite stakeholders ● Proposal requesting a global transparency report ● Proposal regarding political expenditures values alignment ● Proposal requesting an independent Board chair
                                                                                                                    policy ● Proposal requesting a report on risks from state policies restricting reproductive
rights If a shareowner proponent, or a representative who is qualified under state law, is present and submits a proposal for a vote,
then the proposal will be voted on at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST each of the shareowner proposals See page 98 for further information Table of Contents 10 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT “ We value the input
you provide to us
throughout the
year through our
ongoing shareowner
engagement efforts. ” 5 Governance Letter from Our Lead Independent Director DEAR FELLOW SHAREOWNERS: On behalf of our entire Board of Directors, I am pleased to present our annual Proxy Statement and to report on some of the key issues
you’ll find in this document. Our business had a successful year in 2022. We have once again
        demonstrated delivering value to shareowners, as we recently announced our 61 st consecutive dividend increase. Our Board is here to help oversee the ongoing success of our business. As our business evolves, so does the Board. Through our ongoing
Board refreshment process, we continue to maintain a balance of skills, tenure and diversity among our Directors. This year, we continued
this process by welcoming Carolyn Everson to the Board and nominating Amity Millhiser for election at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareowners,
who, if elected, will join the Board in July after her retirement from her current role. Carolyn and Amity each bring valuable skills
and perspective to the Board and I am excited for their contributions. In the past five years, assuming the election of Ms. Millhiser, five new Directors have joined the Board, and six Directors have rolled
off. Our Director nominees’ average tenure is 8 years, the average age is 63.1, and 31% of the Board is racially or ethnically diverse. I am extremely proud that we also achieved gender parity in 2022, with six women on our 12-member
Board. The Directors standing for election have deep and
        varied experiences related to matters that are key to our business success. These include experience in finance, risk oversight,
        executive leadership, government, our industry, marketing, innovation, technology, emerging markets, strategy development and
        sustainability. Their profiles begin on page 18 . We also prioritize a focus on the Board’s processes and structures to ensure they remain effectively designed to help us meet our
objectives. To this end, we have made changes to our Board committee structure to streamline oversight responsibilities. Effective February
2023, the work of the ESG and Public Policy Committee and the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance was merged into a single
committee, which was renamed the “Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee.” Table of Contents 11 Our Board believes that
                                       ensuring strong, independent Board leadership is a crucial requirement to build long-term shareowner
                                       value. As your Lead Independent Director, I am actively engaged with James Quincey
    in a partnership to ensure we remain strategically positioned to successfully grow our business. We value the input you provide to us throughout the year through our ongoing
    shareowner engagement efforts. I look forward to continuing to serve as a key point of contact at the Board level for shareowners. One of the important ways shareowners provide feedback is through the annual
    advisory vote on compensation. We take this vote seriously. Last year we had an outcome that was significantly lower than what we’ve
    typically received, and the Board oversaw important investor outreach to ensure we understood and responded to your feedback. We report
    on this more fully in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, which begins on page 53 . Finally, we recognize that Board leadership structure is an important issue
    for many shareowners. Our Board believes that ensuring strong, independent Board leadership is a crucial requirement to build long-term
    shareowner value. Every year, I lead an executive session of non-management Directors to consider whether the position of Chair should
    be held by the CEO or by a separate individual. Today, we believe the Company’s Board leadership structure with a combined Chair
    and CEO, balanced by a strong Lead Independent Director, will deliver the best results. We discuss this more fully on page 33 of
    this Proxy Statement. Thank you for your support and for your interest and investment in The Coca-Cola
    Company. MARIA ELENA LAGOMASINO, Lead Independent Director Table of Contents 12 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Election of Directors 1 WHAT AM I VOTING ON? The Board of Directors,

for good cause to serve, proxies may be voted for another person nominated as a substitute by the Board, or the Board may reduce the

candidates are interviewed to assess intangible qualities, including the individual’s ability to ask difficult questions and, simultaneously,
to work collegially. KEY QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCES TO
BE REPRESENTED ON THE BOARD The Board has identified key qualifications
and experiences that are important to be represented on the Board as a whole, in light of the Company’s business strategy and expected
future business needs. The table below summarizes how these key qualifications and experiences are linked to our Company’s core
business needs and priorities. Core Business Needs and Priorities Key Qualifications and Experiences The Company’s business is multifaceted and involves complex financial transactions in many countries and in many currencies. High level of strategic and financial experience Relevant senior leadership/Chief Executive Officer experience Marketing and innovation are focus areas of the Company’s business, and the Company seeks to develop and deploy
    the world’s most effective marketing and innovative products and technology. Marketing experience Innovation/technology experience The Company’s business is truly global and multicultural , with its products sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. The Company’s business requires compliance with a variety of regulatory requirements across a number of countries and the ability to maintain relationships with various governmental entities and nongovernmental organizations. Broad international exposure/ emerging market experience Governmental or geopolitical expertise The Company’s business is a complicated global enterprise, and most of the Company’s products are manufactured
    and sold by bottling partners around the world. Extensive knowledge of the Company’s business and/or industry The Board’s responsibilities include understanding and overseeing the various risks facing the Company and ensuring
    that appropriate policies and procedures are in place to effectively manage risk. Risk oversight/management expertise As a foundational step in how we conduct business and develop our corporate strategy, our Company focuses on advancing high-priority
    sustainability initiatives , including key initiatives around such issues as sustainable packaging; climate; water stewardship;
    health and nutrition; human rights; and people and communities, including DEI. Sustainability experience CONSIDERATION OF DIVERSITY The Board does not have a specific diversity
policy but fully appreciates the value of Board diversity. Diversity is important because having a variety of points of view improves
the quality of dialogue, contributes to a more effective decision-making process and enhances overall culture in the boardroom. Table of Contents 16 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT In evaluating candidates for Board membership,
the Board and the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee consider many factors based on the specific needs of the business
and what is in the best interests of the Company’s shareowners. This includes diversity of professional experience, race, ethnicity,
gender, age and cultural background. In addition, the Board and the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee focus on how the
experiences and skill sets of each Director nominee complement those of fellow Director nominees to create a balanced Board with diverse
viewpoints and deep expertise. Director Nomination Process The Corporate Governance and Sustainability
Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board a slate of nominees for election at each Annual Meeting of Shareowners. The Corporate
Governance and Sustainability Committee considers a wide range of factors when assessing potential Director nominees. This assessment
includes a review of the potential nominee’s judgment, experiences, independence, understanding of the Company’s business
or other related industries, and such other factors as the Committee concludes are pertinent in light of the current needs of the Board.
A potential nominee’s qualifications are considered to determine whether they meet the qualifications required of all Directors
and the key qualifications and experiences to be represented on the Board, as described above. Further, the Corporate Governance and
Sustainability Committee assesses how each potential nominee would impact the skills and experiences represented on the Board as a whole
in the context of the Board’s overall composition and the Company’s current and future needs. BOARD COMPOSITION AND REFRESHMENT When recommending to the Board the slate
of Director nominees for election at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee strives
to maintain an appropriate balance of tenure, diversity and skills on the Board. The Board believes that refreshment, including
periodic committee rotation, is important to help ensure that Board composition is aligned with the needs of the Company and the Board
as our business evolves over time, and that fresh viewpoints and perspectives are regularly considered. The Board also believes that
over time Directors develop an understanding of the Company and an ability to work effectively as a group. Because this provides significant
value, a degree of continuity year-over-year is beneficial to shareowners and generally should be expected. Directors are elected each year, at the
Annual Meeting of Shareowners, to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Shareowners and until their successors are elected and
qualified. Because term limits could cause the loss of experience or expertise important to the optimal operation of the Board, there
are no absolute limits on the length of time that a Director may serve, but the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and
the Board consider the tenure of Directors as one of several factors in nomination decisions. In addition, the Corporate Governance and
Sustainability Committee evaluates the qualifications and performance of each incumbent Director before recommending the nomination of
that Director for an additional term. Furthermore, pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Directors whose job responsibilities
change or who reach the age of 74 are asked to submit a letter of resignation to the Board. These letters are considered by the Board
and, if applicable, annually thereafter. The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee has reviewed the Director nominees who
were 74 years of age or older and determined to recommend them for reelection based on their skills, qualifications and experiences. Table of Contents 17 SHAREOWNER-RECOMMENDED DIRECTOR CANDIDATES Shareowners who would like the Corporate
Governance and Sustainability Committee to consider their recommendations for nominees for the position of Director should submit their
recommendations in writing by mail to the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee in care of the Office of the Secretary, The
Coca-Cola Company, P.O. Box 1734, Atlanta, Georgia 30301 or by email to asktheboard@coca-cola.com . Recommendations by shareowners
that are made in accordance with these procedures will receive the same consideration by the Corporate Governance and Sustainability
Committee as other suggested nominees. SHAREOWNER-NOMINATED DIRECTOR CANDIDATES We have a “Proxy Access for Director
Nominations” by-law. The proxy access by-law permits a shareowner, or a group of up to 20 shareowners, owning 3% or more of the
Company’s outstanding Common Stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials
Director nominees constituting up to two individuals or 20% of the Board (whichever is greater), provided that the shareowner(s) and
the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in Article I, Section 12 of our By-Laws. See question 30 on page 123 for more
information. MAJORITY VOTING STANDARD AND DIRECTOR
RESIGNATION POLICY Our By-Laws provide that, in an election
of Directors where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of Directors to be elected, each Director must receive the majority
of the votes cast with respect to that Director. If a Director does not receive a majority vote, he or she has agreed that he or she
would submit a letter of resignation to the Board. The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee would make a recommendation
to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board would act on the resignation
taking into account the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, which would include consideration of
the vote and any relevant input from shareowners. The Board would publicly disclose its decision and its rationale within 100 days of
the certification of the election results. The Director who tenders his or her resignation would not participate in the decisions of
the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee or the Board that concern the resignation. Table of Contents 18 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Biographical Information About Our Director Nominees Included in each Director nominee’s biography
that follows is a description of five key qualifications and experiences of such nominee. Many of our Director nominees have more
than five qualifications, and the aggregate number for all Director nominees is reflected on page 14 . The Board and the
Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee believe that the combination of the various qualifications and experiences of
the Director nominees would contribute to an effective and well-functioning Board and that, individually and as a whole, the Director
nominees possess the necessary qualifications to provide effective oversight of the business and quality advice and counsel to
the Company’s management.

Previous Public Company Boards (Past Five Years): None Chair Audit Committee Talent and Compensation Committee Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee Member Finance Committee Executive Committee Table of Contents 29 Board and Committee Governance ROLE OF THE BOARD The Board is elected by the shareowners to oversee their
interests in the long-term health, financial strength, and overall success of the Company’s business. The Board serves as
the ultimate decision-making body of the Company, except for those matters reserved for or shared with the shareowners. The Board
oversees the Company’s governance practices, the proper safeguarding of the assets of the Company, the maintenance of appropriate
financial and other internal controls, and the Company’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Board selects
the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and oversees the members of senior management, who are charged by the Board with
conducting the business of the Company. KEY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD OVERSIGHT OF BUSINESS STRATEGY The Board oversees and monitors strategic
        planning. Business strategy is a key focus at
        the Board level and embedded in the work of Board committees. Company management is charged with
        executing business strategy and provides regular performance updates to the Board. OVERSIGHT OF RISK The Board oversees risk management. Board committees, which meet regularly and report back to the full Board, play significant roles in carrying out the risk oversight function. Company management is charged with managing risk through robust internal processes and effective internal controls. SUCCESSION PLANNING The Board oversees succession planning
        and talent development for senior executive positions. The Corporate Governance and Sustainability
        Committee, which meets regularly and reports back to the full Board, has primary responsibility for developing succession
        plans for the CEO position. The CEO is charged with preparing,
        and reviewing with the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, talent development plans for senior executives
        and their potential successors. Oversight of Business Strategy Oversight of the Company’s business strategy and
strategic planning is a key responsibility of the Board. The Board’s oversight role involves assessing both the opportunities
and risks that the existing strategy and any potential new strategies present for the Company. The Board believes that overseeing
and monitoring strategy is a continuous process and takes a multilayered approach in exercising its duties, including by delegating
certain subject matter areas to relevant committees, while also discussing committee reports and significant Company-wide initiatives
as a full Board. While the Board and its committees oversee strategic
planning, Company management is charged with executing the business strategy. To monitor performance against the Company’s
strategic goals, the Board receives regular updates and actively engages in dialogue with the Company’s senior leaders.
Company leaders and key bottling partners from around the world are also regularly invited to present strategic updates and initiatives
to the Board and its committees, giving Directors insight into local execution. To build industry knowledge and help ensure a holistic
business perspective, boardroom discussions of strategy and results are enhanced with “hands-on” experiences, such
as market and plant visits, which provide Directors an opportunity to see execution of the business strategy firsthand. For example,
in 2022, the Board participated in market visits in certain locations in the United Kingdom and western Europe and visited various
production facilities, including those of Costa Limited and innocent. While the Board’s oversight and management’s
execution of business strategy are viewed with a long-term mindset, the Board and management promote agility by regularly monitoring
progress and results against the Company’s business strategy. The Board is committed to oversight of the Company’s business strategy and strategic planning, including work embedded in regular Board and committee meetings, as well as a dedicated Board meeting each year to focus on strategy. This ongoing effort enables the Board to focus on Company performance over the short, intermediate and long term. In addition to financial and operational performance, non-financial measures, including sustainability goals, are discussed regularly by the Board and Board committees. Table of Contents 30 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Oversight of Risk The
                                         Board has designed a risk governance framework to: understand critical risks in
        the Company’s business and strategy; allocate responsibilities for
        risk oversight among the full Board and its committees; evaluate the Company’s
        risk management processes and whether they are functioning adequately; facilitate open communication
        between management and Directors; leverage the expertise of internal
        subject matter experts and external advisors, as needed; and foster an appropriate culture
        of integrity and risk awareness. One of the Board’s key responsibilities is understanding
                           and overseeing management of the various risks facing the Company over the short, medium and long term.
                           The Board draws on the experience and judgment of all Directors to consider these risks. However, the
                           Board recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Rather, the Board believes
                           that purposeful and appropriate risk taking is essential for the Company to compete successfully around
                           the world and to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives. The Board recognizes that the risks facing the Company vary in likelihood,
        magnitude and immediacy. At the same time, the Board also recognizes that many risks are related to opportunities or strategic
        initiatives designed to grow the Company’s business. In administering its risk oversight function, the Board considers
        the potential impacts of risks, both positive and negative, over various time horizons, informed by the Company’s
        enterprise risk management (“ERM”) program. Board of Directors The Company believes that its Board leadership structure supports the Board’s oversight function. The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through delegation to Board committees, which meet regularly and report back to the Board. Outside Advisors Management and our Board and its committees also engage outside advisors where
        appropriate to assist in the identification, oversight, evaluation and management of the risks facing our business. Advisors
        may be engaged either on a regular basis to inform the Board or management of ongoing risks, or occasionally to advise
        on specific topics. Such advisors include auditors, law firms, financial firms, compensation consultants, cybersecurity
        experts and other consultants. For example, the Audit Committee has for many years retained independent counsel, who attends
        and participates in all meetings of the Committee and regularly consults with the Chair of the Committee. Audit Oversees the Company’s financial statements and the financial reporting process. Oversees accounting and legal matters, the internal audit function, ethics programs (including the Codes of Business Conduct), quality and food safety programs, workplace and distribution safety programs, and information technology security programs, including cybersecurity. Corporate Governance and Sustainability Oversees the Company’s governance practices, Board composition and refreshment, Board committee leadership, the Board’s performance review and succession planning across the most senior positions. Administers the Company’s related person transaction policy. Also oversees the Company’s risks, policies, programs and goals with respect to sustainability, legislative, regulatory and public policy matters. Finance Oversees the Company’s capital structure, pension plan investments, currency risk and hedging programs, taxes, mergers and acquisitions, and capital projects. Talent and Compensation Oversees the Company’s policies and strategies relating to talent, leadership and culture, including DEI, as well as the Company’s compensation philosophy and programs, including incorporating features that mitigate risk without diminishing the incentive nature of compensation. Management While the Board and its committees oversee risk management, Company management is charged with managing risk. The Company has robust internal processes and an effective internal control environment that facilitate the identification and management of risks and regular communication with the Board. Management communicates routinely with the Board, Board committees and individual Directors on the significant risks identified and how they are being managed. Directors are free to, and indeed often do, communicate directly with senior management. Enterprise-Wide Teams and Risk Mitigation Efforts Cross-functional committees and councils including the Disclosure Committee,
        Sustainability Steering Committee, Data Trust Executive Advisory Council and Cybersecurity Oversight Council meet regularly
        to promote strategic leadership and provide management with important perspectives, as well as advise on risk mitigation
        strategies from their areas of specialization. Management also administers other risk mitigation features such as Codes
        of Business Conduct, robust product quality standards and processes, a strong Legal Department and Ethics and Compliance
        Office, and a comprehensive internal and external audit process. ERM Program and Risk Steering Committee The ERM program was created to proactively identify and address risks and related
        opportunities and help achieve business objectives through risk-informed decision making. Responsibilities include identification
        and prioritization of the top risks through a comprehensive risk assessment process, designation of clear risk ownership,
        and facilitation of a collaborative environment that promotes risk dialogue internally and with various bottling partners.
        The Risk Steering Committee is a cross-functional team that meets regularly to provide strategic direction and oversight
        to ERM by assessing mitigation plans of top risks and effectively embedding the plans across the Company. Table of Contents 31 SELECTED AREAS OF OVERSIGHT SPOTLIGHT ON: INTERNAL CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES SPOTLIGHT ON: PRIVACY The Board’s risk governance framework supports the Audit Committee’s oversight of the Company’s internal controls and procedures. Our internal control system is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by the Company’s Disclosure Committee and management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Code of Business Conduct adopted by the Board, applicable to all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries. The Company maintains a multi-disciplinary privacy management program sponsored by the Senior Vice President and General Counsel. The efforts are managed by the Data Trust Executive Advisory Council (the “Council”) that meets regularly to set the direction of the privacy program and act as an escalation point for prioritizing the Company’s response to identified risks and emerging technologies. The Council is chaired by the Chief Privacy Officer and is made up of key functions that enable privacy compliance such as Public Affairs, Communications & Sustainability, Digital and Marketing Innovation, Global Security & Asset Protection, Cyber and others. The Council is a part of the privacy governance framework and receives reports that include analysis of emerging privacy risks, as well as the Company’s plans and strategies to address them, which are regularly presented to the Council and the Audit Committee. SPOTLIGHT ON: CYBERSECURITY SPOTLIGHT ON: SUSTAINABILITY The Board recognizes the importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our consumers, customers and employees, and the Audit Committee is charged with oversight of cybersecurity matters. To more effectively prevent, detect and respond to information security threats, the Company maintains a cyber risk management program, which is supervised by a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer whose team is responsible for leading enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, architecture and processes. The Audit Committee receives regular reports from the Chief Information Security Officer and the Chief Information Officer on, among other things, the Company’s cyber risks and threats, the status of projects to strengthen the Company’s information security systems, assessments of the Company’s security program and the emerging threat landscape. Additionally, the Chief Information Security Officer chairs the Cybersecurity Risk Oversight Council, which drives awareness, ownership and alignment across broad governance and risk stakeholder groups for effective cybersecurity risk management and reporting. In accordance with our Cyber Incident Response Plan, the Audit Committee is promptly informed of cybersecurity incidents with the potential to materially adversely affect the Company or its information systems and is regularly updated about incidents with lesser impact potential. The Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these matters. Our sustainability goals are global, ambitious and broad-reaching, covering areas including water stewardship, reducing added sugar, packaging, climate and DEI. We pursue our sustainability goals through a concerted effort across the entire Coca-Cola system. In partnership with our bottling partners, we operate in more than 200 countries and territories, which gives our sustainability goals global impact. We aim to achieve our ambitious goals to drive system-wide change. The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the Company’s sustainability strategies and initiatives, including the Company’s short-, intermediate- and long-term goals, and receives regular updates on priority sustainability issues, including information on actions and progress toward goals. In addition, while the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee has primary responsibility in overseeing most aspects of the Company’s sustainability programs, the Board works closely with the Audit Committee and the Talent and Compensation Committee on certain related matters that befit the role of those committees. For example, the Audit Committee oversees certain processes related to external sustainability reporting and disclosures, while the Talent and Compensation Committee has purview over the Company’s people and culture strategy, including DEI. The Board and its committees also receive regular reports from the Chief Sustainability Officer, and others as required, related to progress toward achieving the Company’s sustainability goals. SPOTLIGHT ON: HUMAN CAPITAL AND CULTURE The Board is actively engaged in overseeing the Company’s people and culture strategy. The Talent and Compensation Committee reviews and reports back to the Board on a broad range of human capital management topics, including talent management; leadership development; retention; culture; employee engagement; employee education and training; DEI; and equality and fairness. See page 36 for more information on the Talent and Compensation Committee. Table of Contents 32 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Management Development and Succession Planning The Board believes that one of its primary responsibilities
is to oversee the development and retention of senior talent and to ensure that an appropriate succession plan is in place for
our CEO and other members of senior management. The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee,
together with the CEO, regularly reviews senior management talent, including readiness to take on additional leadership roles
and developmental opportunities needed to prepare senior leaders for greater responsibilities. In addition, the Corporate Governance
and Sustainability Committee regularly discusses recommendations and evaluations from the CEO as to potential successors to fill
senior positions. The CEO also provides a regular review to the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee assessing the
members of the executive leadership team and his or her potential to succeed him. This review includes a discussion about development
plans for senior leaders to help prepare them for future succession and contingency plans in the event the CEO is unable to serve
for any reason (including death or disability). To reinforce its succession planning responsibilities, the Board also invites
leaders to present at Board and committee meetings on their respective areas. While the Corporate Governance and Sustainability
Committee has the primary responsibility to develop succession plans for the CEO position, it regularly reports back to the full
Board and decisions are made at the Board level. Table of Contents 33 BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE The Company’s governance framework provides the Board with the flexibility
        to select the appropriate leadership structure for the Company. In making determinations about the leadership structure,
        the Board considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business, what is in the best interests of the Company’s
        shareowners and feedback from our shareowner engagement efforts. The current leadership structure is comprised of a combined Chairman of the
        Board and CEO, a Lead Independent Director, Board committees led primarily by independent Directors and active engagement
        by all Directors. The Board believes that this structure provides an effective balance between strong Company leadership
        and appropriate safeguards and oversight by independent Directors. The Board believes that having one person serve as Chairman and CEO can provide
        certain synergies and efficiencies that enhance the functioning of the Board and, importantly, allow it to most effectively
        execute its role in overseeing business strategy. The Company’s business is complex, and its products are sold in
        more than 200 countries and territories around the world. Most of the Company’s products are manufactured and sold
        by independent bottling partners throughout the world. The CEO maintains strong, hands-on relationships with the leaders
        of bottlers and remains close to the many facets of the business existing in so many places in the world. Because the
        CEO is the Board member closest to this vast and complex business, he or she is best able to identify many of the business
        issues that require Board attention and, as Chairman, can best focus Directors’ attention on the most critical business
        matters. Further, in the Board’s experience, the combined role of Chairman and CEO allows for timely and unfiltered
        communication with the Board on these critical business issues. The Board also believes that there are benefits when the
        same person represents both the Company and the Board throughout the world with bottlers, customers, consumers and other
        stakeholders. To balance the authority and influence inherent in the combined role of Chairman
        and CEO, the Board has been thoughtful in structuring the Lead Independent Director’s role with robust and clearly
        defined responsibilities. Importantly, the Board has considered feedback from shareowner engagement efforts and best practices
        in corporate governance. As an indicator of the Lead Independent Director’s authority, the Board
        has designated the role as the key point of contact at the Board level for shareowner and other stakeholder communications.
        Other duties of the Lead Independent Director include leading the performance evaluation of the Chairman and CEO; leading
        the annual Board evaluation process; collaborating on the structure and responsibilities of Board committees; presiding
        at executive sessions and at each meeting where the Chairman and CEO is not present; approving all Board agendas and information
        sent to the Board; and playing a key role in Board and management succession. In addition, Maria Elena Lagomasino, our
        Lead Independent Director, has strategic and financial experience, international perspective and extensive experience
        managing risk in various commercial settings that give her valuable insight into the Company’s risk profile. The
        Board believes that her unique skillset amplifies her Lead Independent Director role in the boardroom. Having the flexibility to select the appropriate structure based on the specific
        needs of the business is critical. Consistent with the Board’s commitment to good corporate governance practices,
        at least one executive session of the non-employee Directors each year includes a review of the Board’s leadership
        structure and consideration of whether the position of Chairman of the Board should be held by the CEO. All Directors play an active role in overseeing the Company’s business
        both at the Board and committee levels. As part of each regularly scheduled Board meeting, the non-employee Directors
        meet in executive sessions without the CEO present, which are chaired by the Lead Independent Director. These meetings
        allow non-employee Directors to discuss issues of importance to the Company, including the business and affairs of the
        Company as well as matters concerning management, without any members of management present. CURRENT LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE Table of Contents 34 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Duties and Responsibilities The duties and responsibilities of the Chairman of the

evaluation process is an essential component of good corporate governance and Board effectiveness. Under the leadership of the
Lead Independent Director, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee oversees the Board’s annual evaluation
process. The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee periodically reviews the format of the evaluation process, including
whether to utilize a third-party facilitator, to ensure that actionable feedback is solicited on the operation and effectiveness
of the Board, Board committees and Director performance. 3 INCORPORATION OF FEEDBACK Our multi-step evaluation process generates robust
comments and discussion at all levels of the Board, including with respect to Board composition and processes. These evaluation results have led to changes designed to increase
    Board effectiveness and efficiency. For example, over the past few years, enhancements have been made regarding meeting materials
    and discussion topics, the structure of the Board, responsibilities of committees, committee and executive session discussions,
    committee reports to the Board, the Board evaluation process, the Director on-boarding process and providing Directors with
    more opportunities for continuing education and to have hands-on experiences with our business, senior leaders and emerging
    talent around the world. Table of Contents 36 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT BOARD COMMITTEES In 2022, the Board had six standing committees:
the Audit Committee, the Talent and Compensation Committee, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance, the Finance Committee,
the ESG and Public Policy Committee and the Executive Committee. Our Board conducts a portion of our work through
the committee structure, which helps ensure a deeper review and understanding of specific areas or issues and takes advantage
of the various skills and expertise of our Directors. To ensure our committee structure remains effectively designed to help us
meet our objectives, we have made changes to our committee structure to streamline some oversight responsibilities. Effective
February 2023, the work of the ESG and Public Policy Committee and the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance was merged
into one committee, which was renamed the “Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee.” Information about each
committee is provided below. Information about each committee, including membership information, is as of December 31, 2022, and
is provided below. The Board has adopted a written charter for each
of these committees, which is available on the Company’s website www.coca-colacompany.com , by clicking on “Investors”,
then “Corporate Governance” and then “Documents.” Audit

part of our Company’s success. The Board and management believe they best execute their duties when they proactively listen
to, seek to understand, and consider the opinions of our shareowners. We engage with our shareowners and the broader corporate
governance community through a year-round engagement program, which is management-led and overseen by the Board. Our engagement
program is designed to address questions and concerns, provide perspective on Company policies and practices, seek shareowner
input and incorporate feedback, as appropriate. In 2022, in addition to our regular shareowner engagement
efforts, the Talent and Compensation Committee, including our Lead Independent Director, conducted dedicated shareowner outreach
efforts in light of the results of our 2022 “say-on-pay” advisory vote. See the Message from the Talent and Compensation
Committee on page 51 for a discussion of the feedback from our shareowners with respect to our 2022 “say-on-pay”

heard on policy issues that impact our business, employees, consumers, and shareowners. The Company’s participation
in the public policy and political process is conducted in accordance with the principles of the Codes of Business Conduct and
in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In 2022, the Company strengthened its governance framework with respect
to its public policy activities and introduced a new U.S. Political Engagement Policy. Consistent with our commitment to transparency,
we increased the disclosure of our U.S.-based trade associations and organizations of which the Company is a member and the associated
lobbying expenditures. In addition, the Company files international lobbying disclosures according to applicable laws and regulations. The Company was again recognized as a Trendsetter
in the 2022 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability. The Company received its highest score to
date of 95.7%. Issued annually, the Index is produced by the Center for Political Accountability in conjunction with the Zicklin
Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Additional information about our public policy engagement
is available on the Company’s website at www.coca-colacompany.com by clicking on “Investors,” then “Corporate
Governance” and then “Political Engagement Policy.” SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREOWNERS Our By-Laws provide that a special meeting of shareowners
may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the CEO, a majority of our Board or the Secretary, if appropriately requested by a
person (or group of persons) beneficially owning at least a 25% “net long position” of the Company’s Common
Stock. A shareowner’s “net long position” is generally defined as the amount of Common Stock in which the shareowner
holds a positive (also known as “long”) economic interest, reduced by the amount of Common Stock in which the shareowner
holds a negative (also known as “short”) economic interest. ANTI-HEDGING, ANTI-SHORT SALE AND ANTI-PLEDGING
POLICIES The Company’s insider trading policy prohibits
our Directors, executive officers and those employees, independent contractors and consultants who are from time to time added
to the Company’s restricted trading list (collectively, the “Insiders”) from (i) purchasing any financial instrument
that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Company securities (including prepaid variable forward
contracts, equity swaps, zero-cost collars and exchange funds), that were either granted as part of the individual’s compensation
or that the individual holds directly or indirectly, or (ii) engaging in any short sales of Company securities. These prohibitions
also extend to any family member of our Insiders who share the same household with them and any other individual or entity whose
securities trading decisions are influenced or controlled by any of our Insiders (collectively, the “Related Insiders”).
Our policy also prohibits our Directors and executive officers and their Related Insiders from pledging Company Common Stock as
collateral for a loan, holding Company Common Stock on margin or borrowing against Company Common Stock held in a margin account.
Employees of the Company who are not Insiders or Related Insiders are permitted, but discouraged, from entering into hedging transactions
or engaging in short sales involving Company securities or pledging Company Common Stock. CODES OF BUSINESS CONDUCT The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct
for Non-Employee Directors, as well as a Code of Business Conduct that is applicable to the Company’s employees, including
the Named Executive Officers. Our associates, bottling partners, suppliers, customers and consumers can ask questions about our
Codes and other ethics and compliance issues, or report potential violations, through EthicsLine, a global internet and telephone
information and reporting service. The Codes of Business Conduct and information about EthicsLine are available on the Company’s
website at www.coca-colacompany.com , by clicking on “Investors,” then “Corporate Governance” and
then “Code of Conduct.” In the event the Company amends or waives any of the provisions of the Code of Business Conduct
applicable to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller that relates
to any element of the definition of “code of ethics” enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act,
the Company intends to disclose these actions on the Company’s website. Our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer is principally
responsible for administering compliance with our Codes of Business Conduct, with the support of a team of global professionals.
The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer reports directly to the Company’s Senior Vice President and General Counsel. In
addition, the Audit Committee meets with the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer at least annually to discuss the effectiveness
of the Company’s compliance programs and receives status updates of compliance issues at each committee meeting. Table of Contents 41 VIEW THE COMPANY’S GOVERNANCE MATERIALS You can view the Company’s governance materials,

care of the Office of the Secretary, The Coca-Cola Company, P.O. Box 1734, Atlanta, Georgia 30301 or by email to asktheboard@coca-cola.com . Communications may be distributed to all Directors,
or to any individual Director, as appropriate. At the direction of the Board, all mail received may be opened and screened for
security purposes. In addition, items that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board will not be distributed.
Such items include, but are not limited to: ● spam ● junk mail and mass mailings ● product complaints or inquiries ● new product suggestions ● resumes and other forms of job inquiries ● surveys ● business solicitations or advertisements In addition, material that is trivial, obscene,
unduly hostile, threatening or illegal or similarly unsuitable items will be excluded; however, any communication that is excluded
will be made available to any independent, non-employee Director upon request. To help answer many of the questions we receive
about our Company and our products, we offer detailed information about common areas of interest on the “FAQs” page
of our website, www.coca-colacompany.com/faqs . Table of Contents 42 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Director Compensation The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee is responsible for
reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding all matters pertaining to compensation paid to Directors for Board,
Lead Independent Director, committee and committee chair service. Director compensation is provided under The Coca-Cola Company
Directors’ Plan (the “Directors’ Plan”). Directors who also serve as employees of the Company do not receive
payment for service as Directors. In making non-employee Director compensation recommendations, the Corporate
Governance and Sustainability Committee takes various factors into consideration, including, but not limited to, the responsibilities
of Directors generally, as well as committee chairs, and the form and amount of compensation paid to directors by comparable companies.
The charter of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee also authorizes the Committee to engage consultant or advisors
in connection with its review and analysis of Director compensation, if and when it deems appropriate. The Board reviews the recommendations
of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and determines the form and amount of Director compensation. The Committee did not recommend, and the Board did not make, any adjustments
to the Director compensation program in 2022. 2022 ANNUAL DIRECTOR COMPENSATION ANNUAL
    CASH RETAINER $90,000 Cash retainers are paid on a quarterly basis. Under the Directors’
        Plan, non-employee Directors have the option of deferring all or a portion of their cash compensation into share units
        that are paid out in cash after leaving the Board. The $200,000 annual equity retainer is credited in deferred
        share units. The number of share units awarded is equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that could be purchased
        on the open market for $200,000 on April 1. Share units do not have voting rights but are credited with hypothetical dividends
        that are reinvested in additional units to the extent dividends on Common Stock are received by shareowners. Share units
        are paid out in cash on the later of (i) January 15 of the year following the year in which the Director leaves the Board
        and (ii) six months after the Director leaves the Board. Directors may elect to take their payout in a lump sum or in
        up to five annual installments. Directors do not receive fees for attending Board or committee
        meetings. Directors who serve on committees (other than as chair) do not receive additional compensation for committee
        service. Non-employee Directors are reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with Board-related activities. ANNUAL EQUITY RETAINER $200,000 ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION Lead Independent Director $30,000 Chair of Audit Committee $30,000 Chair of Talent and Compensation Committee $25,000 Chairs of all other Committees $20,000 HIGHLIGHTS OF DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM ● Emphasis on Equity: Aligns
    the majority of Directors’ compensation with shareowner interests because the value of share units fluctuates up or
    down depending on the price of our Common Stock. ● Long-Term Focus: Focuses on the long
    term, because share units are not paid until after the Director leaves the Board. ● Market Competitive: In line with
    peers and equitable based on the work required of Directors serving at an entity of the Company’s size and scope. ● No Fees: No fees are paid for Board
    or committee meeting attendance. ● Stock Ownership
    Requirements: Since share units are not paid out until after the Director leaves the Board, all Directors hold their annual
    equity retainers until after retirement from Board service. As a result, after only 3 years of service, all Directors maintain
    an equity ownership level of at least five times the annual cash retainer. Table of Contents 43 The following table details the total compensation of the Company’s

    on the Board following such appointment. (3) Mr. Kotick did not stand for reelection at the 2022 Annual Meeting. Therefore, the information
    reflects his service on the Board through the 2022 Annual Meeting. Fees Earned or Paid in Cash (Column (b)) The amounts reported in the Fees Earned or Paid in Cash column reflect
the cash fees earned by each non-employee Director in 2022, whether or not such fees were deferred. In addition to the $90,000
annual cash fees (or a prorated portion thereof): (i) Mr. Weinberg received an additional $30,000 for service as Audit Committee
Chair; (ii) Ms. Gayle received an additional $25,000 for service as Talent and Compensation Committee Chair; and (iii) each of
Mses. Herman and Lagomasino and Mr. Diller received an additional $20,000 for service as a chair of other committees. Ms. Lagomasino
also received an additional $30,000 for service as Lead Independent Director. The table below shows the non-employee Directors who deferred any portion
of their 2022 cash compensation into share units. The number of share units is equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that
could be purchased for the deferred amount based on the average of the high and low prices of a share of Common Stock on April
1, 2022. Director Elective Deferral in Share Units Ms. Botín 1,079 Mr. Davis 1,439 Mr. Diller 1,759 Mr. Kotick (1) 719 Ms. Lagomasino 2,239 Mr. Weinberg 1,919 (1) The number of share units reported for Mr. Kotick represents a prorated number of share units due to

fair value associated with each non-employee Director’s share units that are required to be deferred under the Directors’
Plan, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification
718, Compensation–Stock Compensation (“ASC Topic 718”). The table below shows the number of outstanding share units held by each
non-employee Director who served during 2022. Director Outstanding Share Units as of 12/31/2022 Mr. Allen 3,291 Mr. Bolland 40,115 Ms. Botín 61,508 Mr. Davis 28,358 Mr. Diller 178,443 Ms. Everson 1,947 Ms. Gayle 52,404 Ms. Herman 79,403 Mr. Kotick 71,133 Ms. Lagomasino 98,363 Ms. Tsay 22,080 Mr. Weinberg 52,707 All Other Compensation (Column (g)) The amounts reported in the All Other Compensation column reflect, where
applicable, Company matching gifts to nonprofit organizations and other charitable contributions, premiums for life insurance
(including accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident coverage), the costs of Company products provided to
Directors without charge, and gifts provided to Directors by the Company. In addition, infrequently, spouses and guests of Directors
may travel on Company aircraft for personal reasons when the aircraft is already going to a specific destination for a business
reason, which has minimal incremental cost to the Company. When this occurs, a nominal amount is included in the All Other Compensation
column. In addition, income is imputed to the Director for income tax purposes, and the Director is not provided a tax reimbursement. Further described below are the amounts reflected in the All Other Compensation
column that are required by SEC rules to be separately identified for 2022. None of the non-employee Directors received an aggregate
of $10,000 or more of perquisites or other personal benefits from the Company in 2022. The total cost incurred by the Company
in 2022 for products provided to non-employee Directors was approximately $15,850. CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS The Directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s matching
gifts program, which is the same program available to all U.S.-based employees and retirees. In 2022, this program matched up
to $10,000 of charitable contributions on a two-for-one basis to tax-exempt arts, cultural, environmental and educational organizations.
The total cost of matching contributions on behalf of the non-employee Directors for 2022 under the Company’s matching gifts
program was $20,000, to match certain charitable contributions made by Ms. Herman. INSURANCE PREMIUMS For Mr. Diller, who elected coverage prior to 2006, the Company provides
life insurance coverage, which includes $30,000 term life insurance and $100,000 group accidental death and dismemberment insurance.
This coverage was discontinued in 2006 for all other Directors. The Company cost for this insurance in 2022 was $735. Business travel accident insurance coverage of $200,000 is provided to
all non-employee Directors while traveling on Company business, at a Company cost of $3.45 per Director per year. Table of Contents 45 Director Independence and Related Person Transactions INDEPENDENCE STANDARDS Under the NYSE listing standards and the Company’s Corporate Governance
Guidelines, the Board must consist of a majority of independent Directors. In making independence determinations, the Board observes
NYSE and SEC criteria and considers all relevant facts and circumstances. To be considered independent for these purposes, the
Director must (i) meet the bright-line independence standards under the NYSE listing standards, and (ii) the Board must affirmatively
determine that the Director otherwise has no material relationship with the Company directly, or as an officer, shareowner or
partner of an organization that has a relationship with the Company. To aid in the Director independence assessment process, the Board has
adopted categorical standards that identify categories of relationships that the Board has determined would not affect a Director’s
independence. These categorical standards, which are part of the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, specify that
the following will not be considered material relationships that would impair a Director’s independence: Immaterial
    Sales/Purchases The Director is an executive officer
    or employee or any member of his or her immediate family is an executive officer of any other organization that does business
    with the Company and the annual sales to, or purchases from, the Company are less than $1 million or 1% of the consolidated
    gross revenues of such organization, whichever is more. Immaterial
    Indebtedness The
    Director or any member of his or her immediate family is an executive officer of any other organization which is indebted
    to the Company, or to which the Company is indebted, and the total amount of either company’s indebtedness to the other
    is less than $1 million or 1% of the total consolidated assets of the organization on which the Director or any member of
    his or her immediate family serves as an executive officer, whichever is more. Immaterial
    Position The
    Director is a director or trustee, but not an executive officer, or any member of his or her immediate family is a director,
    trustee or employee, but not an executive officer, of any other organization (other than the Company’s outside auditing
    firm) that does business with, or receives donations from, the Company. Immaterial
    Ownership The
    Director or any member of his or her immediate family holds a less than a 10% interest in any other organization that has
    a relationship with the Company. Immaterial
    Nonprofit Relationship The
    Director or any member of his or her immediate family serves as an executive officer of a charitable or educational organization
    which receives contributions from the Company in a single fiscal year of less than $1 million or 2% of that organization’s
    consolidated gross revenues, whichever is more. INDEPENDENCE ASSESSMENT The Board, through its Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee,
annually reviews all relevant business relationships any Director nominee and any person who served as a Director during 2022
may have with the Company. As a result of its annual review, the Board has determined that none of the following Director nominees
has a material relationship with the Company and, as a result, such Director nominees are independent: Herb Allen, Marc Bolland,
Ana Botín, Christopher C. Davis, Barry Diller, Carolyn Everson, Helene D. Gayle, Alexis M. Herman, Maria Elena Lagomasino,
Amity Millhiser, Caroline J. Tsay and David B. Weinberg. None of the Directors who were determined to be independent had any relationships
that were outside the categorical standards identified above. In addition, the Board determined that Robert A. Kotick, who served
as a Director for a portion of 2022, was independent. James Quincey has served as the Company’s CEO since May 1, 2017,
and therefore is not an independent Director. All of the Directors who serve as members of the Audit Committee, Talent
and Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee are independent under our independence standards,
the applicable rules of the SEC and the NYSE listing standards. All members of the Audit Committee and the Talent and Compensation
Committee are also compliant with the enhanced independence requirements for audit committee members and compensation committee
members, respectively. The table below summarizes the relationships that were considered in connection
with the independence determinations. None of the transactions described below were considered material relationships that impacted
the applicable Director’s independence. Table of Contents 46 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Director Categorical Standard Description
    of Relationship Ana Botín Immaterial Sales/Purchases The Board examined the Company’s relationship with Banco Santander, S.A. (“Banco
    Santander”) where Ana Botín, one of our Directors, is Executive Chair. The Board determined that the relationship
    was not material since (i) the amounts involved were less than 1% of the consolidated gross revenues of Banco Santander; (ii)
    the Company’s investment of excess cash with Banco Santander, primarily in time deposits which provided market rate
    returns, is part of the Company’s overall cash management and investment strategy which includes banks other than Banco
    Santander; (iii) the Company’s payments to Banco Santander relate to banking fees, all in the ordinary course of business;
    and (iv) the Company has had a relationship with Banco Santander and its banking subsidiaries for many years prior to Ms.
    Botín’s service as a Director of the Company. Amity Millhiser Immaterial Sales/Purchases The Board examined the Company’s relationship with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”),
    where Amity Millhiser, a Director nominee, is Vice Chair and a partner. The Board determined that the relationship was not
    material since (i) Ms. Millhiser will have retired from PwC prior to the beginning of her term as a Director of the Company;
    (ii) Ms. Millhiser does not have and has not had a direct or indirect material interest in any of the services provided by
    PwC to the Company; (iii) the Company has had a relationship with PwC for many years; and (iv) PwC does not serve as the Company’s
    internal or external auditor. RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS The Board has adopted a written policy for the review of certain related
person transactions between any Director, Director nominee, executive officer, any beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company’s
Common Stock and any immediate family member of any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Related Persons”) and the
Company. For purposes of this policy, a “related person transaction” includes, subject to certain exceptions, any
transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which (i) the
Company or any subsidiary is a participant; (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000 in any fiscal year; and (iii) any Related
Person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The policy is administered by the Corporate Governance and Sustainability
Committee, which will approve only those transactions that are, in its judgment, appropriate or desirable under the circumstances.
In approving a transaction, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee may impose conditions it deems appropriate in
its discretion. In determining whether or not to approve a related person transaction, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability
Committee considers among other factors it deems appropriate: ● The business purpose of and the potential benefits to the Company
    of the transaction; ● The nature and extent of the Related Person’s interest in the transaction; ● The approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the transaction; ● Whether the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of the Company’s
    business; ● Whether the terms of the transaction are fair to the Company and on terms
    no less favorable to the Company than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated third party; ● The availability of other sources for comparable products or services; ● Whether the transaction would impair the independence of a non-employee
    Director; and ● Whether the transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for
    any Director, Director nominee or executive officer, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial
    position of the applicable Related Person, the direct or indirect nature of the applicable Related Person, the ongoing nature
    of any proposed relationship and any other relevant factors. No Director may participate in the discussion or approval of a transaction
in which that Director, or an immediate family member, has a direct or indirect interest. Many transactions that constitute related person transactions are ongoing,
and some of those transactions predate the Related Person’s relationship with the Company. When such transactions are ongoing,
the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee will annually review the transactions and determine if it is in the best
interests of the Company and its shareowners to continue, modify or terminate any related person transaction. Since January 1, 2022, there has not been, nor is there currently proposed,
any related person transaction in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries was a participant, the amount involved exceeded
or will exceed $120,000 and in which any Related Person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Table of Contents 47 6 Share Ownership Directors and Executive Officers The following table sets forth information regarding beneficial ownership

regarding their initial stock ownership and subsequent changes to their ownership with the SEC. Based solely on a review of the reports filed for fiscal year 2022 and
related written representations, we believe that all Section 16(a) reports were filed on a timely basis, except for (i) an amended
Form 3 filed on July 26, 2022 for Carolyn Everson to report her ownership of 517 shares that were inadvertently omitted from her
Form 3; and (ii) a Form 5 filed on February 23, 2023 for Kathy Loveless to report the disposition on December 15, 2022 of restricted

        Vote to Approve Executive Compensation 2 WHAT AM I VOTING ON? Shareowners are being asked to
approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as described in the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis beginning on page 53 and the Compensation Tables beginning on page 70 . The Board
                                     of Directors recommends a vote FOR the advisory
                                     vote to approve executive compensation. In deciding how to vote on this
proposal, the Board encourages you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the Compensation Tables. The Talent and
Compensation Committee has made several key enhancements in recent years to our compensation programs in order to continue to
improve the alignment between compensation designs and outcomes and the Company’s business and talent strategies, as well
as the long-term interests of our shareowners. The Board recommends that shareowners
vote FOR the following resolution: “RESOLVED, that the
shareowners approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this
Proxy Statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Compensation Tables and the related narrative disclosure.” The Talent and Compensation Committee
takes very seriously its role in the governance of the Company’s compensation programs and values thoughtful input from
shareowners. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. However, the Board values shareowners’
opinions, and the Talent and Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the advisory vote when considering future executive
compensation decisions. The Board has adopted a policy of providing for annual advisory votes from shareowners on executive compensation.
The next such vote will occur at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareowners, subject to the outcome of the advisory vote on the frequency
of future advisory votes to approve executive compensation (see page 91 ). Table of Contents 51 Message from the Talent and Compensation
Committee 2022
    was a strong year for the Company as it executed its strategy for growth in a dynamic operating and macroeconomic environment.
    The Company also focused on delivering against its talent strategy through certain key leadership transitions that will help
    continue to drive the business forward. As a Committee, we are committed to working with Company management to design talent
    and compensation programs that align executives’ interests with those of our shareowners. We take seriously the annual
    “say-on-pay” advisory vote, and following an outcome that was significantly lower than what we’ve typically
    received in the past, we oversaw important investor outreach throughout 2022 to ensure we are understanding and responding
    to your feedback. 2022 “Say-on-Pay”
Results and Response The annual advisory vote to approve
executive compensation, also known as “say-on-pay,” is one tool we as a Committee use to gauge shareowner sentiment
regarding the Company’s executive compensation programs. Last year, the Company’s say-on-pay vote received support
from approximately 51% of votes cast. As we have received an average say-on-pay vote of 92% in the five preceding years, the Committee
fully understands and appreciates the seriousness of this message from our shareowners and the need to be responsive. In response to last year’s
say-on-pay result, the Committee, including the Company’s Lead Independent Director, conducted outreach efforts to discuss
our talent and compensation programs with shareowners and to listen to shareowner feedback. In addition to a robust engagement
process conducted during proxy season, we engaged with shareowners representing approximately 35% of our Common Stock on this
issue after the vote, including 13 of our top 15 investors. Notably, these engagements confirmed
that shareowners generally approve of our pay-for-performance philosophy, as well as the design of our executive compensation
programs. Shareowners also expressed support for our recent compensation initiatives, and in particular, supported the incorporation
of sustainability measures into our annual and long-term incentive programs. The general sentiment we heard from these engagements
was that our programs are working to attract and retain talent and are well designed from a pay-for-performance perspective, and
that our governance practices are strong. However, the reason cited by those
who voted against the say-on-pay proposal in 2022 was the use of a consulting agreement entered into with the Company’s
former General Counsel, both in terms of quantum and transparency around the rationale for the agreement. The Committee and full Board have
taken this investor feedback seriously, assessing key themes from shareowners’ input. While the Company has historically
used consulting agreements in limited circumstances to address specific needs such as receiving unique advice and counsel or to
aid in successful transitions, often with full approval from the Board, we understand from our investor feedback that we must
remain committed to continue to monitor and limit the use of consulting agreements, and to provide transparency and rationale
to help shareowners understand decisions made by the Committee. We believe this is an appropriate action based on the feedback
from our investors. We remain proud of the many best
practices we have incorporated into our compensation programs over the years, which are summarized in “Checklist of Compensation
Practices” on page 56 of this Proxy Statement. Table of Contents 52 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Key Leadership Transitions Assessing the leadership team and
overseeing succession planning for senior roles are critical responsibilities of the Board. In 2022, the Company announced several
key leadership changes. John Murphy expanded his responsibilities effective October 1, 2022, taking on the role of President in
addition to his role as Chief Financial Officer. He now oversees Global Ventures; Platform Services; Online-to-Offline Digital
Transformation; Customer and Commercial Leadership; and the Company’s Bottling Investments Group. Brian J. Smith stepped
down from his role as President and Chief Operating Officer effective September 30, 2022, and supported the organization as senior
executive, ensuring a smooth transition across our broad and complex global Coca-Cola system, until he retired from the Company
on February 28, 2023. Alfredo Rivera transitioned from his role as President, North America Operating Unit on December 31, 2022,
and will separate from the organization on March 31, 2023. Jennifer Mann, a 25-year veteran of the Company with deep operational
experience, succeeded Mr. Rivera, becoming our first female executive to oversee the North America Operating Unit. Additionally,
the Company continued to build the next generation of leaders with select appointments in the Platform Services function, operating
unit leadership and marketing category roles. We believe these leadership changes will help support the Company’s continued
growth and enable smooth transitions of the important responsibilities of these leaders. Continuing Our Commitment to
Environmental Sustainability and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Our Compensation Programs In 2022, the Committee approved
changes to our compensation programs to tie certain sustainability goals to compensation for the Company’s executive officers.
These changes set an important precedent and reinforce our belief that the Company’s environmental sustainability and DEI
goals are among the key drivers of future growth. The Committee was encouraged by our executive officers’ efforts in 2022
to promote progress toward the Company’s sustainability goals, and we determined to continue to include the same DEI components
in the annual incentive awards for 2023, as well as the same environmental sustainability components in the performance share
unit awards for the 2023-2025 performance cycle. We believe that these components in our compensation programs will continue to
drive positive change for the Company as we strive to refresh the world and make a difference. HELENE

Compensation Committee (referred to as the “Committee” in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis) has made under
those programs, and the factors considered in making those decisions. This Compensation Discussion and Analysis focuses on the
compensation of our Named Executive Officers for 2022. The titles below for our Named Executive Officers represent positions as
of December 31, 2022. JAMES QUINCEY JOHN MURPHY MANUEL ARROYO ALFREDO RIVERA BRIAN J. SMITH Chairman of the Board
    and Chief Executive Officer President and Chief Financial Officer 1 Chief Marketing Officer President, North America Operating Unit 2 Senior Executive; Former President and Chief Operating Officer 3 1 Mr. Murphy served as
    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer through September 30, 2022, when he was appointed to his current role
    of President and Chief Financial Officer. 2 Mr. Rivera transitioned
    to the role of senior advisor on January 1, 2023 and will separate from the Company on March 31, 2023. 3 Mr. Smith served as
    President and Chief Operating Officer through September 30, 2022, when he transitioned to the role of senior executive. He
    retired from the Company on February 28, 2023. 2022 PERFORMANCE IN REVIEW In 2022, the Company delivered strong results, executing amidst a challenging
external environment that remained dynamic as inflation, geopolitical tensions and pandemic-related mobility restrictions persisted.
The vast majority of pay for executives is at-risk and performance-based. The key financial measures in our incentive plans are
reflective of our growth strategy, are widely used to evaluate the success of our business, are prevalent amongst our peers, and
are highly correlated with long-term value creation. We set incentive targets in line with our externally communicated long-term
growth plan, which aligns our compensation programs with investors’ growth and value creation expectations. NET OPERATING REVENUE GROWTH ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH (NON-GAAP)* OPERATING INCOME GROWTH COMPARABLE CURRENCY NEUTRAL OPERATING INCOME GROWTH (NON-GAAP)* * Organic revenues is a non-GAAP
    financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural
    changes, as applicable, and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Comparable currency neutral operating
    income is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability and
    the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See Annex C on page 127 for reconciliations of
    non-GAAP financial measures to our results as reported under GAAP. Table of Contents 54 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Compensation Results In 2022, the financial performance targets for the annual incentive award
were set at 5% for net operating revenue growth and 7% for operating income growth, each of which is within our long-term growth
plan for those measures of 4% to 6% and 6% to 8%, respectively. Accordingly, our strong financial performance certified under
our incentive plans of 16% net operating revenue growth and 19.5% operating income growth resulted in a payout that was above
target, consistent with our philosophy of tying executive pay to performance. For more information on the 2022 incentive payouts
for our Named Executive Officers, see the discussion beginning on page 58 . ANNUAL INCENTIVE PAYOUT LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PSU PAYOUT % of Target % of Target *   Discretionary incentive payment * Reflects decrease of award as a result of application of the relative

    stronger PSU program were both certified at 200% Returns to Shareowners The Company’s strong financial performance in recent years has allowed
us to increase returns to shareowners on an accelerated basis. Despite currency headwinds and macroeconomic volatility, we have
grown U.S. dollar earnings per share and cash flow from operations, which has allowed the Company to continue to grow the dividend.
In February 2023, we announced a 4.5% increase in our dividend per share of Common Stock, which is the 61 st consecutive
annual increase. DIVIDENDS PER SHARE TOTAL SHAREOWNER RETURN (“TSR”)* CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS EARNINGS PER SHARE * The Total Shareowner Return graph shows how a $100 investment in the Company’s Common Stock on December 31, 2017 would have grown to $163 on December 31, 2022, with dividends reinvested on the day of issuance, outperforming both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Food & Beverage Total Return Index over the five-year period. Table of Contents 55 2022 COMPENSATION OUTCOMES The Committee is accountable for making decisions about executive compensation
that are in the best long-term interests of our shareowners. We strive to achieve this through adherence to the Company’s
compensation philosophy and core principles and by carefully considering feedback received from shareowners to continually enhance
our compensation programs. The following table illustrates the total direct compensation (in millions)
for each of our Named Executive Officers in 2022. James Quincey John Murphy Manuel Arroyo Alfredo Rivera Brian J. Smith LONG-TERM INCENTIVE $14.1 $4.7 $4.1 $2.3 $5.1 ANNUAL INCENTIVE $6.1 $2.6 $1.6 $1.3 $3.1 BASE SALARY $1.6 $1.0 $0.7 $0.7 $0.9 TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION* $21.8 $8.2 $6.4 $4.2 $9.2 *     Total Direct Compensation comprises base salary, actual annual incentive
and the grant date fair value of the long-term incentive awards for 2022. Certain columns may not add due to rounding. OUR COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND CORE PRINCIPLES While we consider many factors in our pay decisions, we are guided by
the following core philosophies and principles: PAY FOR PERFORMANCE The vast majority of pay for executive officers is at-risk and
        performance-based with measures aligned to the Company’s long-term growth plan. Performance is assessed in the following ways: ● The Company’s financial performance, including results against long-term growth targets ● The Company’s sustainability performance, including results against predefined measures ● Return to shareowners over time, both on an absolute basis and relative to our peers ALIGNMENT WITH SHAREOWNERS Our compensation programs are designed to align executives’
    interests with those of our shareowners. A majority of pay for our Named Executive Officers is tied to Company performance.
    We also maintain stock ownership guidelines for executive officers and remain committed to our Equity Stewardship Guidelines.
    Our robust governance practices enable us to be good stewards of equity incentives. PROVIDE
PROGRAMS THAT DRIVE LONG-TERM PROFITABLE GROWTH We invest in and reward talent with the greatest potential to drive
    the long-term profitable growth of our Company, while holding employees accountable to the Company’s strategy and values. SIMPLICITY AND TRANSPARENCY Our compensation programs include clear performance measures and
    line of sight for employees. RECOGNITION OF INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE Our compensation programs reward individual performance in a number
        of areas that contribute to our growth and success. For example, the Company’s executives are responsible for achievement
        of non-financial goals, which are critical to the long-term success of our business, reflect our external responsibility
        as global leaders, and add value for our shareowners and other stakeholders. In addition, individual performance against our cultural values
        and leadership behaviors is also taken into consideration in our compensation programs. Executives are thus motivated
        to deliver results that align with Company values and shareowner interests. CONSIDER THE COCA-COLA SYSTEM Our employees are required to operate and have influence in the context
    of our broad and complex global Coca-Cola system, which includes our approximately 200 bottling partners around the world.
    While the Company had $43.0 billion in 2022 reported net operating revenues and employed approximately 82,500 people as of
    December 31, 2022, the Coca-Cola system generates more than $100 billion in annual revenues, operates in more than 200 countries
    and territories, and employs more than 700,000 people. Our executives and employees must not only manage our business but
    also support our bottling partners and other partners. This alignment and a shared vision of success are critical to drive
    long-term growth. ALIGNMENT OF APPROACH ACROSS THE WORKFORCE Our people, at every level, are our most important asset. The Committee
    takes seriously the Company’s goal to structure pay programs, from the CEO down through the entire workforce, in a manner
    that reinforces the Company’s growth agenda. The Committee also understands that CEO pay should be perceived as reasonable
    relative to overall employee pay. The compensation approach used to set CEO and Named Executive Officer pay is the same approach
    used in determining compensation for the broader workforce, including pay competitiveness and the use of performance-based
    measures that reward exceptional financial performance. In its discretion in determining CEO and Named Executive Officer pay,
    the Committee may also consider other factors that it regularly reviews, including shareowner and employee feedback, the shareowner
    advisory vote on compensation, CEO pay ratio, global pay fairness, and progress against sustainability goals. Table of Contents 56 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Talent and Compensation Committee Oversight is a Year-Round Process We have a robust engagement, planning, review and approval process
        to oversee the Company’s strategies relating to executive compensation, talent, leadership and culture, including
        DEI. When evaluating pay reported in the 2022 Summary Compensation
        Table against Company performance, it is important to consider the timing of compensation decisions and which performance
        period informs each of the annual and long-term incentive awards. For instance: ● Annual
        incentive awards reported for 2022 were decided in February 2023 and reflect performance against targets and goals set
        in February 2022; and ● Long-term
        incentive awards reported for 2022 were granted in February 2022 and reflect the individual’s potential to drive
        future growth. Highlights from our 2022 agenda are set forth in the adjacent
        table. JANUARY-MARCH ● Reviewed

    base salary, annual incentives and long-term incentives, which are described below. In addition, we provide limited perquisites
    (see page 64 ) and standard retirement and benefit plans (see pages 68 and 124 ). BASE SALARY ANNUAL INCENTIVE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE Fixed cash compensation based on the market-competitive value of
    the skills and knowledge required for each role. Base salary is reviewed and adjusted when appropriate to maintain market
    competitiveness. Increases in base salary are not automatic or guaranteed. Variable cash compensation designed to reward results in the prior
        year. Annual cash incentives are based on: ● Company and operating unit financial measures (net operating revenue growth and operating income growth) ● Non-financial measures (progress toward DEI aspirations) ● Individual performance Equity awards designed to motivate executives and reward potential
        to drive long-term growth, as well as to align the interests of employees with those of shareowners. Grants are awarded
        in the form of stock options and PSUs. Performance measures for the PSUs granted in 2022 were as follows: ● Net operating revenue growth ● Earnings per share growth ● Free cash flow ● Certain environmental sustainability measures ● Relative TSR modifier IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT OUR INCENTIVE TARGETS Rigor
    of Incentive Targets Choice
    of Incentive Measures The Committee recognizes the importance of achieving an appropriate balance
                                         between rewarding executives for strong performance over both the short term and long
                                         term and establishing realistic but rigorous targets that continue to attract, motivate
                                         and retain executives. In 2022, the Committee continued to dedicate time to assess the robustness and rigor of our incentive targets, considering
        the following: ● Performance levels in line with our long-term growth plan ● The likelihood of achieving various levels of performance, including consideration of macroeconomic
factors ● Measures, program designs and results at companies in our
        comparator group The key financial measures in our incentive plans align with our growth
                                         strategy, are widely used measures to evaluate the success of our business by investors,
                                         are prevalent amongst our compensation comparator group, and are highly correlated with
                                         long-term value creation. Our non-financial sustainability measures in our incentive
                                         plans align with the Company’s priority issues and reinforce our executives’
                                         accountability for both our short- and long-term sustainability goals. To evaluate performance
                                         in a manner consistent with how management evaluates our operating results and trends,
                                         the key financial measures in our annual and long-term incentive plans are measured on
                                         a non-GAAP basis. We make certain adjustments when calculating these results, such as
                                         for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, items impacting comparability,
                                         changes in financial accounting reporting regulations, and costs and other financial
                                         implications associated with certain corporate transactions. Our incentive targets are currency neutral because the Committee believes these targets should measure the underlying
        results of the business and that business leaders should be encouraged to make decisions that help drive long-term sustainable
        growth rather than which address short-term currency fluctuations. This philosophy has been in place for several years,
        and we review this issue regularly, as it is an important concern for global companies like ours with significant exposure
        to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Table of Contents 58 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Base Salary Base salary is fixed cash compensation delivered in return for day-to-day
job responsibilities, leadership skills and experience. Market-competitive base salaries help attract and retain executive talent.
Base salary is not intended to reward past performance. The Committee annually reviews the base salaries of our Named Executive
Officers and makes adjustments when appropriate based on market competitiveness. The Committee may also make periodic adjustments
in connection with promotions or changes in responsibility. In April 2022, adjustments were made to the base salaries of each of the
Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Quincey to align with market competitiveness. Mr. Murphy also received an additional increase
to his base salary in October 2022, in connection with his appointment to President and Chief Financial Officer. Name Base Salary (12/31/2021) ($) Base Salary (12/31/2022) ($) Mr. Quincey $ 1,600,000 $ 1,600,000 Mr. Murphy 895,000 1,025,000 Mr. Arroyo 650,000 669,500 Mr. Rivera 650,000 663,000 Mr. Smith 910,000 937,300 Annual Incentive Compensation Annual cash incentives are determined under the Annual Incentive Plan
and are designed to reward annual performance and individual contributions that support business results and strategy. Awards
for our Named Executive Officers are determined based on a formula with predefined financial and non-financial measures (“Business
Performance Factor”) aligned with the Company’s long-term growth strategy as well as the executive’s individual
performance (“Individual Performance Amount”). BASE SALARY × TARGET PERCENTAGE × BUSINESS PERFORMANCE FACTOR + INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE AMOUNT (+/- 30%) = ANNUAL INCENTIVE AMOUNT (0-200%) BUSINESS PERFORMANCE FACTOR Actual awards under the Annual Incentive Plan for the Named Executive
Officers are primarily driven by the Business Performance Factor, which follows a formulaic calculation utilizing financial performance
targets and non-financial goals determined at the outset of the performance period. The Committee selects measures and targets
that it believes are consistent with the Company’s strategic goals and which are designed to be challenging but achievable. For 2022, the Committee selected net operating revenue growth and operating
income growth as the financial performance measures for the Business Performance Factor. The Committee also determined to include
certain non-financial goals in the Business Performance Factor to reinforce accountability for our executives with respect to
the Company’s DEI goals. These non-financial goals accounted for 10% of the Business Performance Factor, and were based
on predefined quantitative and qualitative components (the “DEI Components”). These DEI Components were designed to
promote progress toward the Company’s 2030 aspirations to be 50% led by women globally, and to align race and ethnicity
representation to census data in the U.S., as well as to encourage the design and implementation of sustainable DEI strategies. For Messrs. Quincey, Murphy, Arroyo and Smith, the Committee approved
a Business Performance Factor design that was weighted 45% for overall Company net operating revenue growth, 45% for overall Company
operating income growth (“Overall Company Financial Performance”) and 10% for the DEI Components. For Mr. Rivera,
who had responsibility in 2022 for the Company’s North America Operating Unit (“NAOU”), the Committee approved
a Business Performance Factor design that was weighted 60% for Overall Company Financial Performance, as described above, 30%
for the performance of the NAOU, measured by its net operating revenue growth and operating income growth, each weighted equally,
and 10% for the DEI Components. Actual net operating revenue and operating income growth results were
rounded to the nearest half percent, and the Committee determined whether each of the DEI components was either achieved or not
achieved. The payout for each performance measure was then weighted to determine the final Business Performance Factor. For 2022, the Business Performance Factor could range
from 0% to 190% of the target incentive and a minimum threshold must be achieved in order to receive a payout. For 2022, the maximum
was set to be difficult to achieve and our payout results reflect our extraordinary business performance for the year. Table of Contents 59 The overall financial targets and non-financial goals and results
for the Company for 2022 were as follows: Financial
    Measures Performance
    Measure Target* Actual Performance Result Weighting Weighted Result Net Operating Revenue Growth** 16.0% 200% 45% 90% Operating Income Growth** 19.5% 200% 45% 90% Non-Financial
    Measures Performance Measure Goal Actual Performance Result Weighting Weighted Result DEI Components*** Progress All
    Achieved 100% 10% 10% Company Performance Factor 190% * The specific targets for the NAOU are not disclosed because they relate to business
    operations in a specific geography and disclosure could result in competitive harm. ** Net operating revenue growth is organic, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or
    has otherwise been adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes, as applicable, and the impact
    of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income growth is comparable currency neutral (adjusted for structural
    changes), which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability,
    the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the impact of structural changes, as applicable. Items impacting
    comparability include asset impairments, transaction gains/losses, restructuring and other items. Structural changes generally
    refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations, including the impact of intercompany transactions among our
    operating segments. Using these adjusted measures of net operating revenue growth and operating income growth is appropriate
    because they provide a more consistent comparison against the prior year. *** 40% of the overall weighting of the DEI Components was determined by quantitatively demonstrating
    progress as of December 31, 2022 against the prior year period in terms of representation of women in leadership globally
    and People of color in leadership in the U.S. As the Company demonstrated progress in both of these categories, the Committee
    determined that this quantitative component was achieved for 2022. 60% of the overall weighting of the DEI Components was based on our executive officers demonstrating
    efforts to design and implement DEI strategies with a focus on creating a culture of inclusion and building sustainable programs
    to foster recruitment, development and retention of diverse talent. The Committee determined this qualitative component was
    achieved for 2022 based on the Committee’s review of a comprehensive summary of actions completed by the executive officers
    during 2022. Examples included: expanding external strategic partnerships with a focus on developing, retaining and attracting
    diverse talent; expanding employee-led Inclusion Networks globally to enhance cultural sensitivity and awareness, in addition
    to supporting business-related diversity initiatives; successfully leveraging “reverse mentor” programs to drive
    inspirational leadership; and activating monthly in-person connection and skill-up experiences to drive collaboration, connection
    to the team and business, and build capabilities. To learn more about our Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategy,
    see page 7 . The base salary, target annual incentive and 2022 Business Performance
Factor for each of our Named Executive Officers were as follows: Name Base Salary (12/31/2022) ($) Target (%) Target Annual Incentive ($) Business Performance Factor (%) Mr. Quincey $ 1,600,000 200% $ 3,200,000 190% Mr. Murphy* 1,025,000 131% 1,345,313 190% Mr. Arroyo 669,500 125% 836,875 190% Mr. Rivera** 663,000 100% 663,000 190% Mr. Smith 937,300 175% 1,640,275 190% * Mr. Murphy’s target is prorated based on his time spent in 2022 as Executive Vice President
    and Chief Financial Officer with a target of 125% and as President and Chief Financial Officer with a target of 150%, resulting
    in a 2022 target of 131.25%. ** For Mr. Rivera, the Business Performance Factor was weighted 60% for Overall Company Performance
    (at 200%), 30% for NAOU net operating revenue and operating income performance (at 200%) and 10% for DEI Components, as discussed
    above (at 100%). Table of Contents 60 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE AMOUNTS For the Individual Performance Amount, the Committee considers each Named
Executive Officer’s individual contributions to overall Company results and operational goals, achievement of key strategic
objectives and contributions toward evolving the Company’s organization and culture. An Individual Performance Amount may
be awarded based on an assessment of an executive’s individual performance throughout the year as guided by the individual’s
scorecard. The scorecard provides a framework to clearly define specific action items in support of the Company’s key objectives:
win more consumers; gain market share; strong system economics; strengthen stakeholder impact; and equip the organization to win.
The maximum percentage of an individual’s target award that could have been awarded for individual performance in 2022 was
30%. In 2022, the Committee decided not to adjust the payouts based on individual performance for any of the Named Executive Officers. Long-Term Incentive Compensation The Company’s long-term incentive compensation programs are designed
to reward performance over the longer term and align the interests of employees with those of shareowners. The vast majority of
these awards are performance-based. In 2022, all annual long-term incentive awards were equity-based for our Named Executive Officers.
All equity awards are subject to our Equity Stewardship Guidelines. An update regarding our 2022 progress against these guidelines
is included on page 64 under Equity Stewardship Guidelines and Scorecard. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS: AMOUNTS AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Committee sets award ranges for long-term incentive compensation at
the executive officer levels. In 2022, the ranges were informed by surveys of our comparator group’s and similar companies’
pay practices. The Committee does not target a specific percentile ranking against our comparator group and may grant long-term
incentive awards at the higher end of the range for a variety of factors, including individual performance and to reflect support
of the larger Coca-Cola system. Consideration is also given to the individual’s skills, impact, experience and future potential. Once the value of the 2022 long-term incentive award was determined, the
Committee granted the long-term incentive award as a combination of stock options and PSUs with a three-year performance period.
Due to the rules for how the grant date fair value of long-term incentive awards must be calculated for GAAP purposes, the 2022
Summary Compensation Table may not reflect the same stock option and PSU values described below. In addition, the values for GAAP
purposes can increase or decrease each year, causing volatility in the long-term incentive awards reported. HOW STOCK OPTION AWARD AMOUNTS WERE DETERMINED ● When determining the number of stock options awarded, a Black-Scholes value is calculated,
    and a floor and ceiling are then applied based on a 30-day average stock price. This “guardrail” helps manage
    our burn rate commitment and mitigate against excessively high and low Black-Scholes values. ● For stock option grants in 2022, our guardrail was used, which valued options at 20% of the 30-day
    average stock price. This resulted in significantly fewer stock options being granted than what would have been granted using
    a pure Black-Scholes model. HOW PSU AMOUNTS AND TARGETS WERE DETERMINED ● The number of PSUs awarded was calculated using a 30-day average stock price. ● For PSU awards granted in 2022, performance measures were weighted 30% for net operating revenues,
    30% for earnings per share, 30% for free cash flow and 10% for achievement of certain environmental sustainability measures. ● The financial performance targets were derived from our long-term growth plan and were set by the
    Committee after a detailed review, which included benchmarking performance and evaluating the practices of comparator companies. ● The environmental sustainability component of the 2022 PSU awards was equally weighted based upon
    the achievement of predefined goals related to the Company’s World Without Waste packaging strategy (global recycled
    polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) usage rate) and its 2030 Water Security Strategy (watershed leadership locations replenishment
    rate). ● For PSU awards granted in 2022, participants would receive 50% of the award at the threshold level
    of performance per measure, 100% of the award at the target level of performance per measure and 200% of the award at the
    maximum level of performance per measure, prior to application of the relative TSR modifier. Table of Contents 61 PSU RELATIVE TSR MODIFIER ● The number of shares earned from PSU awards will be reduced or increased for Named
    Executive Officers if TSR over the performance period relative to a predefined TSR comparator group falls outside of a predefined
    range. Specifically, after the performance results are certified, the award will be modified up or down as shown in the table
    below, if applicable. If
    total shareowner return over the performance period is: Then: At or above the 75 th percentile
    of the TSR comparator group The award will be increased 25% At or above the 25 th and below
    the 75 th percentile of the TSR comparator group No change will be made to the award Below the 25 th percentile of
    the TSR comparator group The award will be decreased 25% ● For awards granted prior to 2023, this TSR comparator group was aligned with our compensation
    comparator group (see page 66 ). In 2022, the Committee determined to adjust the TSR comparator group for awards granted
    in 2023 and thereafter. The new TSR comparator group will be those companies listed in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index.
    The Committee determined this was appropriate as it better aligns the TSR modifier to a peer group more commonly used by the
    Company’s investors. ● If there is no change to the PSU payout because the relative TSR modifier is not applicable, PSU
    payouts can range from 0% to 200%. If the threshold level or greater is achieved for each of the performance measures, and
    if the relative TSR modifier is applicable, PSU payouts can range from 38% to 250%. 2022 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS The Committee approved the following long-term incentive awards for the
Named Executive Officers in February 2022. Messrs. Quincey, Murphy and Smith received a long-term incentive grant split into 1/2
performance share units and 1/2 stock options. Messrs. Arroyo and Rivera received a long-term incentive grant split into 2/3 performance
share units and 1/3 stock options.

        on Company performance. 2021-2023 (1)(2)(3)(4) ● As
        of December 31, 2022, payout was projected at the maximum level. Company performance over the remaining year of the performance
        period will determine the number of shares earned, if any. ● Results

        of December 31, 2022, payout was projected above the target level. Company performance over the remaining two years of the performance
        period will determine the number of shares earned, if any. ● Results
        will be certified in February 2025, including applying the relative TSR modifier, if applicable. Table of Contents 63 (1) Participants receive 50% of the award
    at the threshold level of performance per measure, 100% of the award at the target level of performance per measure and 200%
    of the award at the maximum level of performance per measure. Results are rounded and the number of shares is extrapolated
    on a linear basis between performance levels for the net operating revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow performance
    measures. For the environmental sustainability performance measures, results are rounded and the number of shares is not extrapolated
    between performance levels. (2) The PSU program provides for comparable currency
    neutral net operating revenue growth to be based on a three-year compound annual growth target tied to Company performance.
    This measure differs from net operating revenue growth reported under GAAP, primarily due to the impact of currency and items
    impacting comparability. The calculation of comparable currency neutral net operating revenue growth for the 2020-2022 period
    was adjusted, and the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods will be adjusted, to exclude acquisitions, divestitures and structural
    changes that are significant to the Company as a whole, if applicable. The 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods will also be adjusted
    to exclude the impact of accounting changes, if applicable. Beginning with the 2021-2023 period, the calculation will be adjusted
    for any unusual items that are significant to the Company as a whole, and these items are approved by the Committee. (3) The PSU program provides for comparable currency
    neutral earnings per share growth to be based on a three-year compound annual growth target tied to Company performance. This
    measure differs from earnings per share reported under GAAP, primarily due to the impact of currency and items impacting comparability.
    The calculation of comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth for the 2020-2022 period was adjusted, and the 2021-2023
    and 2022-2024 periods will be adjusted, to exclude acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes that are significant
    to the Company as a whole, if applicable. The 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods will also be adjusted to exclude the impact
    of accounting changes, if applicable. Beginning with the 2021-2023 period, earnings per share growth will be adjusted for
    tax impacts resulting from the application of the tax court rulings and/or settlements arising from the Statutory Notice of
    Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service received on September 17, 2015 (the “2015 Notice of Deficiency”)
    and will also be adjusted for any unusual items that are significant to the Company as a whole, and these items are approved
    by the Committee. (4) The PSU program provides for free cash flow to
    be based on a cumulative three-year absolute target amount tied to Company performance. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial
    measure that represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. The net
    income component of net cash provided by operating activities for the 2020-2022 period was adjusted, and the 2021-2023 and
    2022-2024 periods will be adjusted, for the impact of currency. Free cash flow for the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods will
    be adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes that are significant to the Company as a whole, the impact
    of accounting changes and certain cash payments for pension plan contributions, if applicable. Beginning with the 2021-2023
    period, free cash flow will be adjusted for tax impacts resulting from the application of the tax court rulings and/or settlements
    arising from the 2015 Notice of Deficiency and will also be adjusted for any unusual items that are significant to the Company
    as a whole, and these items are approved by the Committee. (5) The PSU program for the 2021-2022 period provides
    for comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth to be based on a two-year compound annual growth target tied to
    Company performance. This measure differs from earnings per share reported under GAAP, primarily due to the impact of currency
    and items impacting comparability. The calculation of comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth for the 2021-2022
    period was adjusted to exclude acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes that are significant to the Company as a
    whole, if applicable. (6) The PSU program for the 2022-2024 period provides
    for the environmental sustainability performance measure to be equally weighted based on the achievement of predefined goals
    related to the Company’s World Without Waste packaging strategy (global rPET usage rate) and its 2030 Water Security
    Strategy (watershed leadership locations replenishment rate). “Global rPET usage rate” is defined as the percent
    of rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate) procured for use in our global primary consumer PET packaging (non-refillable
    PET bottles and refillable PET bottles). “Watershed leadership locations replenishment
    rate” is the ratio of replenish project volumetric benefits (located within “leadership locations” minors
    basins and/or their water supply watersheds) divided by the replenishment required in the “leadership locations”
    (its total water use less its beneficial wastewater discharge). “Leadership locations” is a Company designation
    for locations of Company manufacturing facilities that satisfy the criteria of a water risk assessment. The environmental
    sustainability calculation for the 2022-2024 period will be adjusted to exclude acquisitions, divestitures and structural
    changes that are significant to the Company as a whole, if applicable. In addition, the calculation will be adjusted for any
    unusual items that are significant to the Company as a whole, and these items are approved by the Committee. OTHER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS The vast majority of equity awards are made as part of the long-term incentive
awards in February of each year; however, the Committee may during the course of the year determine to grant additional equity
awards, which typically have been limited and in the form of time-based restricted stock units or performance-based awards. From time to time, we establish additional performance-based
programs related to specific performance goals to motivate and reward for specific initiatives. No Named Executive Officer received
such an award in 2022. Table of Contents 64 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT EQUITY STEWARDSHIP GUIDELINES AND SCORECARD We have adopted Equity Stewardship Guidelines, which specify how we will
use long-term equity compensation with respect to the global employee population. The Equity Stewardship Guidelines can be viewed
on the Company’s website at www.coca-colacompany.com , by clicking on “Investors,” then “Corporate
Governance” and then “Documents.” Under the Equity Stewardship Guidelines, we have committed to an annual
burn rate of 0.4% or less, which makes availability of shares used for equity awards more certain. With respect to dilution, it
is our intention to use the proceeds from stock option exercises by employees to repurchase shares over time, minimizing dilution,
but such proceeds may at times be used for other corporate purposes. Actual dilution is expected to continue to be less than 1%
per year. This approach provides us the flexibility to consider share repurchases in the context of our overall capital allocation
strategy. For transparency, we also provide an Equity Scorecard. ● The annual equity awards represent
    the vast majority of equity awards granted during the year. ● Total overhang includes outstanding awards granted
    under plans (“Prior Plans”) in place prior to adoption of The Coca-Cola Company 2014 Equity Plan, as amended (the
    “2014 Equity Plan”). Awards from Prior Plans that expire or are forfeited will not be issued or available for
    future issuance. Total overhang will decline each year as equity awards are exercised, and as awards from Prior Plans expire
    or are forfeited. ● In the Equity Scorecard, actual dilution is how
    much the equity issued to employees reduces the value of existing shares. 2022 EQUITY SCORECARD Description 2022 Burn Rate Commitment Maximum average burn rate of 0.4% for the 2014 Equity Plan. 0.40% Actual Burn Rate The total number of shares underlying equity awards granted in the year, as a percentage of Common Stock outstanding. 0.23% Overhang The total number of shares underlying equity awards already granted plus those available for future grants, as a percentage of Common Stock outstanding. Prior Plans 2014 Equity Plan Total With Equity Stewardship Guidelines (1) 0.47% 4.62% 5.09% Actual Dilution A measure of how much the equity issued to employees reduces the value of existing shares. (2) 0.06% (1) With the burn rate commitment, over the 2014 Equity Plan’s ten-year term, the maximum number
    of shares estimated to be used is 200 million (based on Common Stock outstanding decreasing by 1% each year). (2) Calculated by dividing the number of net shares issued to employees during the year by the average number of shares of
    Common Stock outstanding. The number of net shares issued represents the difference between the total number of shares issued
    and the number of shares repurchased solely using proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Does not include additional
    share repurchases which further mitigate dilution. PERQUISITES AND OTHER PERSONAL BENEFITS We provide a limited number of perquisites and other personal benefits
to our Named Executive Officers. The table below summarizes and provides the business rationale for each of the perquisites and
other personal benefits provided to the Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2022. The Committee reviews and carefully considers
the reasonableness of and rationale for providing these perquisites and believes these perquisites are consistent with market
practice. For more information about these perquisites and other personal benefits,
and their values, see the discussion beginning on page 72 . Category Business Rationale Aircraft Usage To allow travel time of our Chairman and CEO and our President and Chief Financial Officer, as
    well as our former President and Chief Operating Officer, to be used productively for the Company; for security purposes due
    to the high profile and global nature of our business and well-recognized brands; and to ensure availability to respond to
    business priorities from any location around the world. International Service Program To promote global mobility and development opportunities for individuals working outside their
    home country. Financial and Tax Planning To address the complex tax and financial situations and assist in compliance with local country
    laws for a significant percentage of our executive officers with dual nationalities or work histories in a number of countries. Other Executive physicals are made available to set an example for active, healthy living. Club membership
    privileges are provided to Mr. Murphy, primarily for business purposes. Table of Contents 65 HOW WE MAKE COMPENSATION DECISIONS Shareowner Engagement and Results of 2022 Advisory Vote on Executive
Compensation The Company has a long-standing shareowner outreach program and routinely
interacts with shareowners on a number of matters, including executive compensation (see page 39 ). At the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareowners, approximately 51% of the votes
cast were in favor of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. As we have received an average say-on-pay vote of 92%
in the five preceding years, the Committee fully understands and appreciates the seriousness of this message from our shareowners
and the need to be responsive. In response to last year’s say-on-pay result, the Committee, including
the Company’s Lead Independent Director, conducted outreach efforts to discuss our talent and compensation programs with
shareowners and to listen to shareowner feedback. In addition to a robust engagement process conducted during proxy season, we
engaged with shareowners representing approximately 35% of our Common Stock on this issue after the vote, including 13 of our
top 15 investors. Notably, these engagements confirmed that shareowners generally approve of our pay-for-performance philosophy,
as well as the design of our executive compensation programs. Shareowners also expressed support for our recent compensation initiatives,
and in particular, supported the incorporation of sustainability measures into our annual and long-term incentive programs. The
general sentiment we heard from these engagements was that our programs are working to attract and retain talent and are well
designed from a pay-for-performance perspective, and that our governance practices are strong. However, the reason cited by those
who voted against the say-on-pay proposal in 2022 was the use of a consulting agreement entered into with the Company’s
former General Counsel, both in terms of quantum and transparency around the rationale for the agreement. The Committee and full Board have taken this investor feedback seriously,
assessing key themes from shareowners’ input. While the Company has historically used consulting agreements in limited circumstances
to address specific needs such as receiving unique advice and counsel or to aid in successful transitions, often with full approval
from the Board, we understand from our investor feedback that we must remain committed to continue to monitor and limit the use
of consulting agreements, and to provide transparency and rationale to help shareowners understand decisions made by the Committee.
We believe this is an appropriate action based on the feedback from our investors. At the 2023 Annual Meeting, we are again holding an advisory vote to approve
executive compensation and will continue to consider the results of the advisory vote when making future compensation decisions.
As required, we are also holding a vote on the frequency of future advisory votes, which we are recommending to continue holding
annually (see page 91 ). Decision-Making Process ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE The Committee reviews and discusses the Board’s evaluation of the
Chairman and CEO and makes preliminary determinations about his base salary, annual incentive, long-term incentive compensation,
and other awards as appropriate. The Committee then discusses the compensation recommendations with the full Board, and the Committee
approves final compensation decisions after this discussion. ROLE OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER For other Named Executive Officers, the CEO considers performance and
makes individual recommendations to the Committee on base salary, annual incentive, long-term incentive compensation, and other
awards as appropriate. The Committee reviews, discusses, modifies and approves, as appropriate, these compensation recommendations. TALENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE RESOURCES AND TOOLS The Committee uses several resources and tools, including data about market
competitiveness, to make compensation decisions in line with our compensation philosophy. Table of Contents 66 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Compensation Comparator Group We use a comparator group of companies when making certain compensation
decisions. The comparator group is used as a reference point, but compensation paid at other companies is only one factor in the
decision-making process. As noted above, our employees operate in the much larger Coca-Cola system, but when comparing size with
comparator companies, we utilize only the net operating revenues and market capitalization of The Coca-Cola Company. We routinely
review the selection criteria and companies in our comparator group. There were no changes to our comparator group effective for
2022 compensation decisions. In 2022, based on input from our Compensation Consultant, the Committee approved updates to the comparator
group to be effective in 2023, which resulted in the addition of four companies (Abbott Laboratories, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company,
Intel Corporation, and The Kraft Heinz Company), and the removal of four companies (AT&T Inc., General Mills, Inc., International
Business Machines Corporation, and Walmart Inc.). The table below shows our criteria on how the comparator group was chosen
and how it is used. How
    the Comparator Group Was Chosen How We Use the Comparator Group* 2022 Comparator Group ● Comparable

    used for some of these purposes when data is not publicly available for the non U.S.-based companies. Role of the Compensation Consultant COMPENSATION CONSULTANT INDEPENDENCE The Committee is authorized by its charter to employ independent compensation
consultants and other advisors. In 2022, the Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (“Meridian”) to
serve as its independent consultant. Meridian reports directly to the Committee. In accordance with the Committee’s Independent Compensation Consultant
Policy, prior to the retention of a compensation consultant (or any other external advisor), and annually thereafter, the Committee
assesses the independence of the compensation consultant. Under the Independent Compensation Consultant Policy, a consultant is
considered independent if: ● The individual consultant and any consulting firm or organization that employs the consultant is independent
    of the Company; ● The individual consultant does not provide services or products of any kind to the Company or its affiliates or to their
    management, other than in its capacity as the Committee’s advisor; and ● The consulting firm may not provide any other services to the Company without the prior written consent of the Committee
    Chair. The Committee assessed Meridian’s independence under the Independent
Compensation Consultant Policy, including considering the following factors specified in the NYSE listing standards: (i) the provision
of other services by the consulting firm to the Company; (ii) the amount of fees paid as a percentage of the total revenue of
the consulting firm; (iii) the policies and procedures of the consulting firm that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest;
(iv) any business or personal relationship of the consultant with a member of the Committee; (v) any stock of the Company owned
by the consultant; and (vi) any business or personal relationship of the consultant or consulting firm with an executive officer
of the Company. Meridian provided the Committee with confirmation of its independent status under the Independent Compensation
Consultant Policy. Based on this evaluation, the Committee has determined that Meridian met the criteria for independence. Table of Contents 67 COMPENSATION CONSULTANT DUTIES ● Reports directly to the Committee with regular interface with the Committee Chair ● Attends all meetings of the Committee, including executive sessions without management present ● Reviews the Company’s executive compensation strategy and programs to ensure appropriateness and market competitiveness ● Provides research, data analyses, survey information and design expertise in developing compensation programs for executives and incentive programs for eligible employees ● Regularly updates the Committee on market trends, changing practices, and legislation pertaining to executive compensation and benefits ● Advises the Committee on the appropriate comparator group for compensation and benefit programs Risk Considerations ● The Committee reviews the risks and rewards associated with the Company’s compensation programs.
    The programs are designed with features that the Committee believes mitigate risk without diminishing the incentive nature
    of the compensation. Our compensation programs encourage and reward prudent business judgment and appropriate risk taking
    over both the short term and the long term. ● The Company’s incentive compensation programs contain appropriate risk mitigation features, including award caps,
    multiple performance measures, clawback features and ranges of awards. In addition, the share ownership and retention guidelines
    mitigate risk. ● In 2022, the Company conducted, and both the Compensation Consultant and the Committee reviewed, a global risk assessment
    of our compensation programs. The risk assessment included conducting a global inventory of incentive plans and programs and
    considered factors such as the plan measures, number of participants, maximum payments and risk mitigation factors. Management
    and the Committee do not believe that any of the Company’s compensation programs create risks that are reasonably likely
    to have a material adverse impact on the Company. As such, the Company did not make any material adjustments to its compensation
    policies and practices as a result of the global risk assessment in 2022. ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION INFORMATION Share Ownership Guidelines ● Share ownership guidelines align the executives’ long-term
financial interests with those of shareowners. ● All Named Executive Officers are in compliance with the share ownership guidelines. ● The ownership guidelines are as follows: Role Value of Common Stock to be Owned* Chief Executive Officer 8 times
    base salary President and Chief Financial Officer 5 times
    base salary Executive Vice Presidents; Operating Unit Presidents
    of North America, Latin America, and Europe;  President of International Development; and Chief Marketing Officer 4 times
    base salary Other senior executives** 2 times base salary * Shares are valued based on the average closing price of Common Stock for the prior one-year period. ** Includes all Company officers subject to Section 16 of the 1934 Act but not otherwise covered by the ownership guidelines. ● Stock options do not count toward the ownership guidelines, and PSUs count only after the performance
    criteria have been met. ● To ensure compliance with the ownership guidelines, the Committee may direct that up to 50% of the annual cash incentive
    be withheld if an executive is not compliant. In addition, the Committee may mandate the retention of 100% of net shares,
    after settlement of taxes and transaction fees. Table of Contents 68 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Share Retention Policy ● To ensure that our executives exhibit a strong commitment to Company stock, we have adopted a share
    retention policy. Our share retention policy applies in addition to the share ownership guidelines described above. ● Executives who have not yet met their share ownership objective must retain 50% of the shares (after paying taxes) obtained
    from option exercises or from the release of performance shares or restricted stock awards until the earlier of the date on
    which the share ownership objective is met or separation from the Company. ● Limited exceptions apply for donations of stock to charities, educational institutions or family foundations and for sales
    or divisions of property in the case of divorce, disability or death. The Committee is authorized to grant waivers in exceptional
    circumstances. Clawbacks ● The Company’s annual and long-term performance compensation, including equity compensation, is
    subject to recoupment, or “clawback,” in certain circumstances. These clawback provisions apply while an individual
    is employed and, if an employee separates from employment, until the later of one year from separation and payment of the
    applicable compensation. ● In addition to any clawbacks required by law, regulation or applicable listing standards, the clawback provisions allow
    the Company to recoup payments if an employee or former employee engages in certain prohibited activities, which include violation
    of any Company policy (including the Company’s Code of Business Conduct), disclosing confidential information or trade
    secrets, accepting employment with competitors or soliciting Company employees. Retirement and Benefit Plans ● Named Executive Officers participate in the same retirement and benefit plans as the broader population
    of non-union employees, as applicable. These plans provide for basic retirement needs and serve as a safety net to protect
    against the financial catastrophes that can result from illness, disability or death. ● Retirement plans generally include pension plans, retirement savings plans and deferred compensation plans. There are
    no special or enhanced pension formulas for the Named Executive Officers. See the 2022 Pension Benefits table on page 78 for the value of accumulated pension benefits for the Named Executive Officers. ● Benefit plans generally include medical, dental and disability plans. Change in Control ● The Company has change in control provisions in its Annual Incentive Plan, its equity plans and some
    of its retirement plans in which the Named Executive Officers participate. Equity plans include “double-trigger”
    change in control provisions. ● Change in control provisions apply equally to all plan participants. There are no special change in control agreements
    or arrangements with any of the Named Executive Officers, and we do not provide a tax gross-up for any change in control situation. ● The change in control provisions are intended to address the concern that, in the event the Company is considering a change
    in control transaction, the employees involved in considering the transaction might otherwise be motivated to act in their
    own interests rather than the interests of the shareowners. ● For a more detailed discussion of change in control provisions, see the Payments on Termination or Change in Control section
    beginning on page 80 . Tax and Accounting Implications of Compensation ● We are generally entitled to a U.S. federal income tax deduction with respect to compensation income
    paid to our service providers, subject to limitation under Section 162(m) of the Tax Code with respect to certain compensation
    in excess of $1 million paid in any one year to each of certain of our current and former executive officers. Generally, under
    GAAP, compensation is expensed as earned. Equity compensation is expensed in accordance with ASC Topic 718, which is generally
    over the vesting period. While the Committee considers tax and accounting implications as factors when considering executive
    compensation, they are not the only factors considered. Other important considerations may outweigh tax or accounting considerations.
    In addition, the Committee reserves the right to establish compensation arrangements that may not be fully tax deductible
    under applicable tax laws. Table of Contents 69 Compensation Committee Report The Talent and Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Talent
and Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in
this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into the Form 10-K. HELENE D. GAYLE CHAIR CAROLYN EVERSON ALEXIS M. HERMAN MARIA ELENA LAGOMASINO Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The Committee is composed entirely of the four independent Directors listed
above. No member of the Committee is a current, or during 2022 was a former, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. During 2022, no member of the Committee had a relationship that must be described under the SEC rules relating to
disclosure of Related Person Transactions. In 2022, none of our executive officers served on the board of directors or compensation
committee of any entity that had one or more of its executive officers serving on the Board or the Talent and Compensation Committee. Table of Contents 70 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Compensation Tables The

(Column (c)) The
amounts reported in the Salary column represent the base salary earned by each of the Named Executive Officers in the applicable
year. Bonus (Column (d)) The amounts reported in the Bonus
column represent any cash-based guaranteed or discretionary bonuses, retention bonuses, hiring bonuses, or relocation bonuses
not based on any predefined performance targets. No such bonuses were awarded to any of the Named Executive Officers in 2021 or
2022. Stock Awards (Column (e)) The
amounts reported in the Stock Awards column represent the grant date fair value of stock awards determined pursuant to ASC Topic
718. For 2022, all of the stock awards reported in the Stock Awards column are PSUs granted under the 2014 Equity Plan, which
pay in stock if predefined performance targets are met over the applicable performance period. If
a PSU award’s threshold level is not achieved, no shares are earned. For PSU awards granted in 2022, if the threshold level
or greater is achieved for each of the performance measures, the number of shares earned ranges from 50% to 200% of the target
number of shares. In addition, the PSUs are subject to a relative TSR modifier. The relative TSR modifier will decrease or increase
the number of shares earned by 25% if TSR over the performance period relative to our compensation comparator group falls outside
of a predefined range. See page 61 for more information about the relative TSR modifier. Table of Contents 71 The
amounts for 2022 in the Summary Compensation Table above reflect the value of the PSU awards at the target (or 100%) level. The

Option Exercises and Stock Vested table on page 77 . Additional information on all outstanding option awards is reflected
in the 2022 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table beginning on page 76 . Non-Equity Incentive Plan
Compensation (Column (g)) The amounts reported in the Non-Equity
Incentive Plan Compensation column reflect the amounts earned by each Named Executive Officer under the Company’s Annual
Incentive Plan. The Annual Incentive Compensation section of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which begins on page
58 , describes how the 2022 Annual Incentive Plan awards to the Named Executive Officers were determined. Change in Pension Value and
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings (Column (h)) The amounts reported for each
year in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column are comprised of changes in the actuarial
present value of the accumulated pension benefits of each of the Named Executive Officers under the applicable pension plan during
such year. Pension values may fluctuate significantly
from year to year depending on a number of factors, including age, years of service, average annual earnings and the assumptions
used to determine the present value, such as the discount rate. The assumptions used by the Company in calculating the change
in pension value are described on page 79 . For 2021, $0 is reported for Mr. Smith because there was a decrease of $5,973
in the actuarial present value of his accumulated pension benefit. The Company cautions that the
values reported in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column are theoretical as those
amounts are calculated pursuant to SEC requirements and are based on assumptions used in preparing the Company’s audited
financial statements for the applicable fiscal years. The Company’s retirement plans utilize a different method of calculating
actuarial present value for the purpose of determining a lump sum payment, if any. The change in pension value from year to year
as reported in the table is subject to market volatility and may not represent the value that a Named Executive Officer will actually
accrue or receive under the Company’s retirement plans during any given year. Table of Contents 72 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT None of the Named Executive Officers
received above-market or preferential earnings (as these terms are defined by the SEC) on their nonqualified deferred compensation
accounts. The material provisions of the
Company’s retirement plans and deferred compensation plans in which the Named Executive Officers participate are described
in the Summary of Plans in Annex B beginning on page 124 . All Other Compensation (Column
(i)) The amounts reported in the All
Other Compensation column reflect, for each Named Executive Officer, the sum of (i) the incremental cost to the Company of all
perquisites and other personal benefits; (ii) the amount of any tax reimbursements; (iii) the amount contributed by the Company
to applicable Company 401(k) and savings plans; and (iv) the dollar value of life insurance premiums paid by the Company. The
material provisions of the Company 401(k) and savings plans in which the Named Executive Officers participate are described in
the Summary of Plans in Annex B beginning on page 124 . The following table outlines those
perquisites and other personal benefits and additional all other compensation required by SEC rules to be separately quantified
for 2022. A dash indicates that the Named Executive Officer received the perquisite or personal benefit, but the amount was not
required to be disclosed under SEC rules. The narrative following the table describes all categories of perquisites and other
personal benefits provided by the Company in 2022. Perquisites and Other

USAGE The
Company operates leased aircraft to allow employees to safely and efficiently travel for business purposes around the world. Given
the Company’s significant global presence, we believe it is a business imperative for senior leaders to be on the ground
at our global operations. The Company aircraft allow employees to be far more productive than if commercial flights were utilized,
as the aircraft provide a confidential and highly productive environment in which to conduct business without the schedule constraints
imposed by commercial airline service. The
Company aircraft are made available to the Named Executive Officers for their personal use in the following situations: ● Use of the Company aircraft is the
        Board’s strongly preferred method for all travel by Mr. Quincey for both business and personal travel. Mr. Smith
        was afforded access to the Company aircraft for business and personal travel due to his role during 2022. Upon becoming President of the Company,
        Mr. Murphy was afforded access to the Company aircraft for business and personal travel. This is for security purposes
        due to the high profile and global nature of our business and well-recognized brands, as well as to ensure that they can
        be immediately available to respond to business priorities from any location around the world. This arrangement also allows
        travel time to be used productively for the Company. Messrs. Quincey, Murphy and Smith, and their immediate family members
        traveling with them, used the Company aircraft for a reasonable number of personal trips. Personal use of the Company
        aircraft results in imputed taxable income. Neither Messrs. Quincey, Murphy nor Smith is provided a tax reimbursement
        for personal use of aircraft. ● No other Named Executive Officers use the Company aircraft for personal purposes except in extraordinary
    circumstances. No other Named Executive Officer used the Company aircraft solely for personal purposes in 2022, other than
    Messrs. Quincey, Murphy and Smith. ● Infrequently, spouses and guests of Named Executive Officers travel on the Company aircraft when
    the aircraft is already going to a specific destination for a business purpose. This use has minimal cost to the Company and,
    where applicable, a nominal amount is included in the All Other Compensation table above. Income is imputed to the Named Executive
    Officer for income tax purposes, but no tax reimbursement is provided since such persons are not traveling for a business
    purpose. Table of Contents 73 ● In determining the incremental cost to the Company of personal use of the Company aircraft, the Company calculates the average direct variable operating costs on an hourly basis, including all costs that may vary by the hours flown. Items included in calculating this cost are as follows: ● aircraft fuel and oil; ● travel, lodging and other expenses for crew; ● prorated amount for routine repairs and maintenance; ● prorated amount for rental fee on airplane hangar (when away from home base); ● catering; ● logistics (landing fees, permits, etc.); and ● the amount, if any, of disallowed tax deductions associated with such use. When an aircraft is already flying
to a destination for business purposes, only the direct variable costs associated with the additional passenger (for example,
catering) are included in determining the aggregate incremental cost to the Company. While it happens very rarely,
if an aircraft travels empty before picking up or after dropping off a passenger flying for personal reasons, this “deadhead”
segment would be included in the incremental cost attributable to overall travel. INTERNATIONAL SERVICE PROGRAM
BENEFITS The Company provides benefits
to globally mobile employees under various international service programs, the material provisions of which are described on page
126 . These programs are designed to relocate and support employees who are sent on an assignment outside of their home country.
The purpose of the programs is to make sure that when the Company requests that an employee move outside his or her home country,
economic considerations do not play a role. This helps the Company quickly meet its business needs around the world and develop
its employees. Mr. Quincey participated in an
international service program through April 30, 2017 because he was a citizen of the United Kingdom who relocated to the United
States. Certain benefits related to his participation in the program were paid in 2022 and may be paid in future years. Mr. Murphy participated in an
international service program through December 31, 2020 because he was a citizen of Ireland who relocated to the United States
in January 2019. Certain benefits related to his participation in the program were paid in 2022 and may be paid in future years. Mr. Arroyo participated in an
international service program for all of 2022 because he was a citizen of Spain based in Singapore. Certain benefits related to
his participation in the program were paid in 2022 and will continue to be paid in future years. Mr. Rivera participated in an
international service program through September 30, 2021 because he was a citizen of Honduras who relocated to the United States.
Benefits related to his participation in the program were paid in 2022 and may be paid in future years. The costs to the Company in 2022
were as follows: Name Home Leave Housing Allowance Cost of Living Allowance Tax Equalization (1) Other Program Allowances Mr. Quincey $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $19,685 $ 0 Mr. Murphy 0 0 0 15,149 0 Mr. Arroyo 65,657 400,787 53,152 0 188,982 Mr. Rivera 0 0 0 25,437 0 (1) The tax equalization amount, which includes tax preparation services, may differ
    significantly from year to year due to differences in timing of payments and tax reporting years in various countries. For
    Mr. Arroyo, these payments did not result in a net reportable benefit for 2022. FINANCIAL
AND TAX PLANNING The
Company provides a taxable reimbursement to the Named Executive Officers for financial planning services, which may include tax
preparation and estate planning services. No tax gross-ups are provided to the Named Executive Officers for this benefit. OTHER
PERQUISITES The
Company makes available executive physicals to executives, including the Named Executive Officers. In 2022, for Mr. Murphy, the
Company paid for club membership privileges, which are used primarily for business purposes but also for occasional personal purposes.
The Company does not incur any additional cost for Mr. Murphy’s use of this membership for personal purposes. Table of Contents 74 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT ADDITIONAL ALL OTHER COMPENSATION TAX REIMBURSEMENT The amounts reported in the table
on page 72 represent tax reimbursements for certain Named Executive Officers. For Messrs. Quincey, Murphy and Smith,
all amounts for 2022 are related to business use of the Company aircraft. No Named Executive Officer is provided a tax reimbursement
for personal use of aircraft, but Named Executive Officers are provided a tax reimbursement for taxes incurred when a spouse or
significant other travels for business purposes. These taxes are incurred because of the Internal Revenue Service’s extremely
limited rules concerning business travel by non-employees. It is sometimes necessary for spouses or significant others to accompany
Named Executive Officers to business functions. In contrast to personal use, the Company does not believe an employee should pay
personally when spousal or significant other travel is required or important for business purposes. To calculate taxable income, the
Standard Industry Fare Level rates set by the Internal Revenue Service are used. Where a tax reimbursement is authorized, it is
calculated using the highest marginal federal tax rate, the applicable state rate and Medicare rates. The rate used to calculate
taxable income has no relationship to the incremental cost to the Company associated with the use of the Company aircraft. COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO COMPANY
401(K) AND SAVINGS PLANS The Company makes matching contributions
to Named Executive Officers who participate in applicable Company 401(k) or savings plans on the same terms and using the same
formulas as other participating employees. In 2022, all of the Named Executive Officers except for Mr. Arroyo participated in
the Company 401(k) Plan and Supplemental 401(k) Plan. The amounts reported in the table
on page 72 represent the following contributions in 2022: ● Mr. Quincey – $10,675 to the 401(k) Plan and $269,325 to the Supplemental 401(k) Plan ● Mr. Murphy – $10,675 to the 401(k) Plan and $101,287 to the Supplemental 401(k) Plan ● Mr. Rivera – $10,675 to the 401(k) Plan and $57,913 to the Supplemental 401(k) Plan ● Mr. Smith – $10,675 to the 401(k) Plan and $133,367 to the Supplemental 401(k) Plan In 2022, Mr. Arroyo participated
in the Mobile Employees Retirement Plan (the “Mobile Plan”), which is included in the 2022 Pension Benefits table
on page 78 . LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUMS The Company provides life insurance
to U.S.-based employees, including the Named Executive Officers. In 2022, this coverage was equal to the lesser of 1.5 times base
pay or $2 million. The amounts reported in the table on page 72 represent the premiums paid for this insurance by the Company. Table of Contents 75 2022 GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED

        participating in an international service program and localized to the United States. As a result, he began participating
        again in the TCCC Pension Plan and the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan and stopped accruing benefits in the Mobile Plan. Mr. Quincey’s total years of
        service with the Company is 26.3 years. He participated in the Coca-Cola UK Stakeholder Pension Plan (the “UK Savings
        Plan”) for a portion of this time. (2) The same years of service apply to both the TCCC Pension Plan and the TCCC Supplemental Pension
    Plan, as these plans work in tandem. (3) In January 2021, Mr. Murphy stopped participating in an international service program and localized
    to the United States. As a result, he began participating in the TCCC Pension Plan and the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan
    and stopped accruing benefits in the Mobile Plan. (4) Mr. Arroyo had a prior period of employment with the Company for which his benefits in the Mobile
    Plan were fully distributed. The service shown reflects service from 2017 when he rejoined the Company and began participating
    again in the Mobile Plan. Mr. Arroyo’s total years of service with the Company is 24.9 years. He participated in a savings
    plan in Spain (the “Spanish Savings Plan”) for a portion of this time. (5) In October 2021, Mr. Rivera stopped participating in an international service program and localized
    to the United States. As a result, he began participating in the TCCC Pension Plan and the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan
    and stopped accruing benefits in the Mobile Plan. The
Company provides retirement benefits from various plans to its employees, including the Named Executive Officers. Due to the Company’s
global operations, it maintains different plans to address different market conditions, various legal and tax requirements, and
different groups of employees. In
2022, all of the Named Executive Officers except for Mr. Arroyo participated in or had a benefit under The Coca-Cola Company Pension
Plan (the “TCCC Pension Plan”) and The Coca-Cola Company Supplemental Pension Plan (the “TCCC Supplemental Pension
Plan”). In 2022, Mr. Arroyo participated in the Mobile Plan. Messrs. Quincey, Murphy and Rivera have a benefit under the
Mobile Plan for the period they were covered under an international service program. Additional details of these plans are described
in the Summary of Plans in Annex B beginning on page 124 . The table above reflects the present value of accumulated
benefits for each of the Named Executive Officers under the applicable plans. Table of Contents 79 Compensation
used for determining pension benefits under the TCCC Pension Plan, the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan and the Mobile Plan generally
includes only base salary and annual cash incentives. The amounts reflected for each plan represent the present value of the maximum
benefit payable under the applicable plans. In some cases, the payments may be reduced for early retirement or by benefits paid
by other Company-sponsored retirement plans, statutory payments or Social Security. The
Company generally does not grant additional years of benefit service, and no Named Executive Officer has been credited with additional
years of benefit service. The
discount rate assumption used by the Company in calculating the present value of accumulated benefits was 5.49% for the TCCC Pension
Plan and 5.48% for the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan. For information on additional assumptions used by the Company in calculating
the present value of accumulated benefits, see Note 13 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in the Form 10-K.
The calculations assume that the Named Executive Officer continues to live at least until the earliest age at which an unreduced
benefit is payable. The
Company’s retirement plans utilize a different method of calculating actuarial present value for the purpose of determining
a lump sum payment, if any. The traditional pension benefit under the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan is paid in the form of an
annuity if the employee has reached at least age 55 with 10 years of service at the time of his or her separation from the Company.
Therefore, Messrs. Quincey and Smith are required to take the traditional pension benefit portion of their TCCC Supplemental Pension
Plan benefit in the form of an annuity. 2022 NONQUALIFIED
DEFERRED COMPENSATION The
following table provides information on the Named Executive Officers’ participation in The Coca-Cola Company Deferred Compensation
Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”) and the Supplemental 401(k) Plan, as applicable. These plans either allow
eligible employees to defer part of their base salary and annual incentive on a voluntary basis or make employees whole when the
Company matching contribution is limited under the tax-qualified plan. The Company matching contribution under the Supplemental
401(k) Plan is provided at the same rate as the Company matching contribution under the 401(k) Plan. The Company does not match
any additional voluntary deferrals. Additional details of the
Deferred Compensation Plan and the Supplemental 401(k) Plan are described in the Summary of Plans in Annex B beginning

(d)) The earnings reflected in column (d) represent deemed
investment earnings or losses from voluntary deferrals and Company contributions, as applicable. The Deferred Compensation Plan
and the Supplemental 401(k) Plan do not guarantee a return on deferred amounts. For these plans, no amounts included in column
(d) are reported in the 2022 Summary Compensation Table because the plans do not provide for above-market or preferential earnings. Aggregate Balance at Last Fiscal Year-End (Column
(f)) The amounts reflected in column (f) for Messrs.
Quincey, Murphy, Rivera and Smith, with the exception of amounts reflected in columns (b), (c) and (d), if any, have been reported
in prior proxy statements of the Company. Payments on Termination or Change in Control GENERAL Most of the Company’s plans and programs contain
specific provisions detailing how payments are treated upon termination or change in control. The specific termination and change
in control provisions under these plans, which are described below, apply to all participants in each plan. The termination scenarios described in this section
include voluntary separation, involuntary separation, disability and death. For more information on the plans described below,
see Summary of Plans in Annex B beginning on page 124 . NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER DEPARTURES As noted above, two of the Named Executive Officers
departed or will be departing the Company in 2023. On February 28, 2023, Mr. Smith retired from the
Company. Upon retirement, Mr. Smith received only the retirement and other benefits he was entitled to under the standard terms
of the applicable Company programs. He did not receive any severance benefits. On March 31, 2023, Mr. Rivera will separate from
the Company. The terms of his separation are governed by a letter, dated August 20, 2022. Pursuant to his letter, among other
things, Mr. Rivera will receive severance benefits under the terms of The Coca-Cola Company Severance Pay Plan (the “TCCC
Severance Plan”) upon his separation. Pursuant to the terms of the Annual Incentive Plan for participants who have met certain
age and service requirements, if Mr. Rivera remains employed through March 31, 2023, he will receive an annual incentive award
for 2023, prorated for three months and payable in March 2024. Mr. Rivera will not receive any further equity grants. All of Mr.
Rivera’s outstanding equity incentive awards will be treated in accordance with the related equity plans and related agreements
(see the 2022 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table beginning on page 76 ). Mr. Rivera’s other benefits
will consist of those benefits accrued and vested under the standard terms and conditions of the plans in which he participates. In accordance with SEC rules, the remainder of this
section assumes that employment for each of Messrs. Smith and Rivera was terminated or a change in control of the Company occurred
as of December 31, 2022 and does not take into account Mr. Smith’s retirement or the terms of Mr. Rivera’s letter
described above. CHANGE IN CONTROL The change in control provisions in the various
Company plans were adopted to mitigate the concern that, in the event the Company is considering a change in control transaction,
the employees involved in considering the transaction might otherwise be motivated to act in their own interests rather than the
interests of the shareowners. Thus, the change in control provisions are designed with the intention of ensuring that employees
are neither harmed nor given a windfall in the event of a change in control. The Company’s plans generally provide that
a change in control may occur upon (i) a greater than 20% change in ownership of the Company; (ii) a change of the majority of
the Board within a two-year period; or (iii) certain merger and consolidation transactions. As described below, Company equity
plans include “double-trigger” change in control provisions. The Company does not have individual change in control
agreements and no tax gross-up is provided for any taxes incurred as a result of a change in control payment. The Board can determine
prior to the potential change in control that no change in control will be deemed to have occurred. Table of Contents 81 SEVERANCE PLAN All of the Named Executive Officers are covered
by the TCCC Severance Plan. Termination, Death, Disability Generally, benefits are payable under the TCCC Severance
Plan when an employee is terminated involuntarily due to certain circumstances, such as an internal reorganization or position
elimination. The maximum cash severance benefit under this plan is two years of base pay, payable as a lump sum. Change in Control There are no separate change in control provisions
included in the TCCC Severance Plan. ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN All of the Named Executive Officers were eligible
to participate in the Annual Incentive Plan in 2022. Termination, Death, Disability Generally, participants employed on December 31
are eligible to receive a cash incentive for the year, regardless of whether employment continues through the payment date. Employees
who (i) terminate employment prior to December 31, 2022 and were employed before January 1, 2012 and are at least 55 years of
age, or are at least 65 years of age regardless of hire date; (ii) die; or (iii) move to an affiliate generally receive a prorated
incentive based on actual Company performance and the portion of the year actually worked. Change in Control Upon a change in control, participants receive the
target amount of the annual incentive after the end of the performance year. This amount is prorated if the participant leaves
during the year. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS All of the Named Executive Officers except for Mr.
Arroyo were eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan in 2022; however, none of them chose to contribute. Termination, Death, Disability Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, employees
who terminate employment after age 50 with five years of service receive payments based on elections made at the time they elected
to defer compensation. Other employees receive a lump sum after termination. Individuals who are designated as “specified
employees” under Section 409A of the Tax Code may not receive payments for at least six months following termination of
employment to the extent the amounts were deferred after January 1, 2005. There are no enhanced benefits payable under the Deferred
Compensation Plan upon a participant’s death or disability. Change in Control Upon a change in control, any Company discretionary
contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan vest. No Named Executive Officer received a Company discretionary contribution
in 2022. EQUITY PLANS All of the Named Executive Officers participated
in the Company’s equity plans in 2022. Termination The treatment of equity upon termination of employment
depends on the reason for the termination, the employee’s age and length of service at termination and the year in which
the award was granted. In 2022, certain age and service provisions were amended, effective for new awards granted in 2022. The
tables below detail the termination provisions of the various equity award types. Table of Contents 82 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2022: Award

    Prior to Meeting Age/ Service Requirement Separation
    After Meeting Age/Service Requirement of 60 Years/10 Years of Service Involuntary
    Separation After Meeting Age/Service Requirement of 50 Years/10 Years of Service (1) Stock Options Employees have six months to exercise vested options. Unvested options are forfeited. All options held at least 12 months vest. Employees have the full remaining term to exercise the options. All options held at least 12 months continue to vest for up to four years. Restricted Stock/ Restricted Stock Units Unvested awards are forfeited. Unvested awards are forfeited. Some grants held at least 12 months vest upon meeting age and service requirements. Unvested awards are forfeited. Some grants held at least 12 months vest upon meeting age and service requirements and will be prorated. PSUs All PSUs are forfeited if separation occurs prior to certification of results and release of PSUs. For grants held at least 12 months, the employee receives the same number of earned shares as active employees after the results are certified. Outstanding PSUs held at least 12 months will not be forfeited and a prorated amount will be released after the results are certified. (1) Applicable for involuntary separations due to specific circumstances, such
    as an internal reorganization or position elimination. AWARDS GRANTED IN 2022: Award Type Separation Prior to Meeting Age Requirement Separation After Meeting Age Requirement of 60 Years Stock Options Employees have six months to exercise vested options. Unvested options are forfeited. All options held at least 12 months vest. Employees have the full remaining term to exercise the options. Restricted Stock/ Restricted Stock Units Unvested awards are forfeited. Unvested awards are forfeited. Some grants held at least 12 months vest upon meeting age requirement. PSUs All PSUs are forfeited if separation occurs prior to certification of results and release of PSUs. For grants held at least 12 months, the employee receives the same number of earned shares as active employees after the
    results are certified. Death If an employee dies, all options vest if the options
have been accepted. The employee’s estate has five years from the date of death to exercise the options, but for options
granted in 2022, the employee’s estate has one year to exercise the options. Provided they have been accepted, restricted
stock and restricted stock units vest and are released to the employee’s estate. Provided the PSUs have been accepted, if
death occurs during the performance period, the employee’s estate receives a cash payment equal to the value of the target
number of shares. For PSUs where performance has been certified, the employee’s estate receives a cash payment based on
the certified results. Disability If an employee terminates employment because of
disability, all options vest, and the employee has the full remaining term to exercise the options. Restricted stock and restricted
stock units vest and are released to the employee. For PSUs in the performance period, the employee receives shares equal to the
number of shares that the employee would have earned based on actual performance after the end of the performance period. Table of Contents 83 Change in Control The treatment of equity awards upon a change in
control is governed by the 2014 Equity Plan. The table below details the “double-trigger” change in control provisions
of the various equity award types if awards are assumed by the successor company. If awards are not assumed by the successor company,
accelerated vesting generally occurs upon a change in control. Award Type Treatment Stock Options Options vest if an employee is terminated without cause within one year following the change in control. Restricted Stock/ Restricted Stock Units Shares vest if an employee is terminated without cause within one year following
    the change in control. PSUs PSUs vest if an employee is terminated without cause within two years following
    the change in control (i) at the target level if the change in control occurs during the first half of the performance period
    and (ii) based on actual performance if the change in control occurs during the second half of the performance period. In
    each case, the final payout is prorated based on time worked during the performance period. RETIREMENT AND 401(K) PLANS All of the Named Executive Officers except for Mr.
Arroyo were eligible to participate in the TCCC Pension Plan, the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan, the 401(k) Plan and the Supplemental
401(k) Plan in 2022. Mr. Arroyo participated in the Mobile Plan in 2022. Mr. Quincey has a benefit under the UK Savings Plan related
to a prior period of employment. Mr. Arroyo has a benefit under the Spanish Savings Plan related to a prior period of employment. Termination, Death, Disability No payments may be made under the TCCC Pension Plan
or the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan until an employee has separated from service and met eligibility requirements. Generally,
no payments may be made under the 401(k) Plan, the Supplemental 401(k) Plan or the Mobile Plan until separation from service,
except distributions may be taken from the 401(k) Plan after age 59½ and distributions related to mandatory tax payments
may be made under the Mobile Plan, whether or not the employee has terminated employment. Individuals who are designated as “specified
employees” under Section 409A of the Tax Code may not receive payments from the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan, the Supplemental
401(k) Plan or the Mobile Plan for at least six months following termination of employment. There are no enhanced benefits payable under the
TCCC Pension Plan, the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan, the 401(k) Plan, the Supplemental 401(k) Plan, the Mobile Plan, the UK
Savings Plan or the Spanish Savings Plan upon a participant’s death or disability. Change in Control The TCCC Pension Plan and the TCCC Supplemental
Pension Plan contain change in control provisions that affect all participants equally, including the participating Named Executive
Officers. These provisions provide an enhanced benefit to vested participants for benefits accrued under the defined benefit formula
if certain conditions are met, including that the employee must actually leave the Company within two years of a change in control.
A change in control has no effect on the cash balance portion of the TCCC Pension Plan and there are no additional credited years
of service. Upon a change in control under the TCCC Pension Plan and the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan, the earliest retirement
age is reduced resulting in an enhanced benefit for participants who have not reached the earliest retirement age. None of the
Named Executive Officers would receive an enhanced benefit. The 401(k) Plan, the Supplemental 401(k) Plan, the
Mobile Plan, the UK Savings Plan and the Spanish Savings Plan do not have special provisions for change in control. Table of Contents 84 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT QUANTIFICATION OF PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR
CHANGE IN CONTROL The following table and footnotes describe the potential
payments to the Named Executive Officers upon termination of employment or a change in control of the Company as of December 31,
2022. While Mr. Smith retired on February 28, 2023 and Mr. Rivera will separate from the Company on March 31, 2023, this section
assumes the applicable triggering event occurred on December 31, 2022. The table does not include: ● compensation or benefits previously earned by the Named Executive Officers or equity awards that are
    fully vested; ● the value of pension benefits that are disclosed in the 2022 Pension Benefits table beginning on page 78 , except
    for any pension enhancement triggered by the event, if applicable; ● the amounts payable under deferred compensation plans that are disclosed in the 2022 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
    table on page 79 ; or ● the value of any benefits (such as retiree health coverage, life insurance and disability coverage) provided on the same
    basis to substantially all other employees in the country in which the Named Executive Officer works.

    Plan because the Named Executive Officers would be entitled to the same payment regardless of whether the event occurred.
    Upon a change in control, the target annual incentive amount is guaranteed (subject to proration if the participant leaves
    before the end of the year). (2) Represents the intrinsic value of the acceleration of vesting of any stock options that
    vest upon the event. Intrinsic value is the difference between the exercise price of the stock option and the closing price
    of Common Stock, which was $63.61 on December 30, 2022, the last trading day of the year. (3) No amounts are included for the 2020-2022, 2021-2023 or 2022-2024 PSU programs or the 2021-2022
    emerging stronger PSU program for Voluntary Separation, Involuntary Termination and Disability because the PSUs remain subject
    to performance requirements even after the event. See page 62 for the status of these PSU programs. Voluntary Separation (Column (a)) Amounts are included under “Stock Options”
for Messrs. Murphy, Rivera and Smith because they have satisfied the age and service requirement for acceleration of vesting of
certain equity awards held for at least 12 months. Messrs. Quincey and Arroyo have not satisfied the age and service requirement
for acceleration of any equity awards, and therefore, no additional payments would be triggered upon voluntary separation. Involuntary Termination (Column (b)) Amounts are included under “Stock Options”
for Messrs. Murphy, Rivera and Smith because they have satisfied the age and service requirement for acceleration of vesting of
certain equity awards held for at least 12 months. Amounts are included under “Stock Options” for Messrs. Quincey
and Arroyo because involuntary termination triggers continued vesting of certain equity awards after the age and service requirement
has been met. Death (Column (c)) Amounts are included under “Stock Options”
and “PSUs and Restricted Stock Units” because death triggers acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards. The
amounts for “PSUs and Restricted Stock Units” reflect the value of the target number of shares granted under the 2020-2022,
2021-2023 and 2022-2024 PSU programs and the 2021-2022 emerging stronger PSU program. Disability (Column (d)) Amounts are included under “Stock Options”
because termination of employment caused by disability triggers acceleration of vesting or continued vesting of certain equity
awards. Change in Control (Column (e)) Amounts are included under “Stock Options”
and “PSUs and Restricted Stock Units” because a change in control triggers acceleration of vesting of certain equity
awards. Since equity awards have “double-trigger” change in control provisions, the table above assumes that both
a change in control and a subsequent termination of employment have occurred. The amounts for “PSUs and Restricted Stock
Units” reflect (i) the value of the number of shares granted under the 2020-2022 PSU program at the maximum award level;
(ii) the value of the number of shares granted under the 2021-2023 PSU program at the maximum award level, prorated for two years
of the performance period; (iii) the value of the number of shares granted under the 2022-2024 PSU program at the target award
level, prorated for one year of the performance period; and (iv) the value of the number of shares granted under the 2021-2022
emerging stronger PSU program at the maximum award level. Table of Contents 86 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Equity Compensation Plan Information All numbers in the following table are as of December
31, 2022. Plan Category Number of Securities to be Issued Upon Exercise of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights (a) Weighted-Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights (b) Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected in Column (a)) (c) Equity Compensation Plans Approved by Security Holders 67,390,640 (1) $45.93 (2) 311,021,286 (3) Equity Compensation Plans Not Approved by Security Holders 0 N/A 0 TOTAL 67,390,640 311,021,286 (1) Includes 58,555,800 shares issuable pursuant to outstanding options under the
    2014 Equity Plan, The Coca-Cola Company 1999 Stock Option Plan and The Coca-Cola Company 2008 Stock Option Plan. The weighted-average
    exercise price of such options is $45.93. Also includes 8,834,840 full-value awards of shares outstanding under the 2014 Equity
    Plan and the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan, including shares that may be issued pursuant to outstanding PSUs, based on
    certified financial results, where applicable, and otherwise assuming the target award is met. (2) The weighted-average remaining contractual life of the outstanding options is 3.6 years. (3) Includes 308,052,031 shares that may be issued pursuant to future awards under the 2014
    Equity Plan, including shares that may be issued pursuant to outstanding PSUs, based on certified financial results, where
    applicable, and otherwise assuming the target award is met. The 2014 Equity Plan uses a fungible share pool under which each
    share issued pursuant to an option reduces the number of shares available by one share, and each share issued pursuant to
    awards other than options reduces the number of shares available by five shares. See Long-Term Incentive Compensation beginning
    on page 60 for more information, including the Equity Stewardship Guidelines, which include a burn rate commitment.
    With this burn rate commitment, over the 2014 Equity Plan’s ten-year term, the maximum number of shares estimated to
    be used is 200,000,000 (based on Common Stock outstanding decreasing by 1% each year). Also includes 2,732,413 options which
    may be issued pursuant to future awards under The Coca-Cola Company 1999 Stock Option Plan and The Coca-Cola Company 2008
    Stock Option Plan and 236,842 shares that may be issued pursuant to the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan. The maximum term
    of the options is ten years. Share units credited under the Supplemental 401(k)
Plan and the Directors’ Plan are not included in the table above since payouts under those plans are in cash. The Company or its applicable subsidiary provides
a matching contribution in Common Stock under various plans throughout the world. No shares are issued by the Company under any
of these plans, and therefore these plans are not included in the table above. Shares are purchased on the open market by a third-party
trustee. These plans are exempt from the shareowner approval requirements of the NYSE. The Company also sponsors employee share purchase
plans in several jurisdictions outside the United States. The Company does not grant or issue Common Stock pursuant to these plans,
but does facilitate the acquisition of Common Stock by employees in a cost-efficient manner. These plans are not equity compensation
plans. Pay Ratio Disclosure As required by SEC rules, we are providing the information
below to explain the relationship between the annual total compensation of Mr. Quincey, who served as the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer in 2022, and the annual total compensation of the median employee of the Company, excluding our CEO. We identified
the median employee using our employee population as of October 1, 2022. We applied an exchange rate as of October 1, 2022, to
convert all foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. There have been no changes in our employee population or employee compensation
arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure for 2022. However, because
the median employee identified for 2021 left the Company before October 1, 2022, we are using a comparable new median employee
with substantially similar compensation as the median employee identified for purposes of our pay ratio disclosure in 2022. The median annual total compensation disclosed below
is based on the Company’s global workforce and is not designed to capture the median compensation of the Company’s
U.S. employees. In addition, employees in flexible, part-time roles, such as certain employees at retail stores operated by Costa
Limited, our coffee business, lower the annual total compensation for our median employee. Our compensation philosophy is to pay
competitively to market and provide fair compensation regardless of the locale. The compensation approach used to determine compensation
for our broader workforce is the same approach we use when setting CEO pay, including consideration of pay competitiveness and
the use of performance-based incentives that reward exceptional business performance in each jurisdiction consistent with market
practice. For more information regarding our compensation philosophy, see page 55 . Table of Contents 87 For 2022, the annual total compensation of our median
employee, a part-time, hourly barista employed in the United Kingdom by Costa Limited, was $12,122. This includes base pay and
an employer retirement contribution. Mr. Quincey’s annual total compensation for 2022, as reported under the “Total”
column (column (j)) in the 2022 Summary Compensation Table, was $22,822,519. Based on this information, for 2022, the ratio of
the compensation of the CEO to the median annual total compensation of all other employees was estimated to be 1,883 to 1. We believe our pay ratio presented above is a reasonable
estimate. The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies,
exemptions, estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, our pay
ratio may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. Pay Versus Performance Disclosure This disclosure has been prepared in accordance
with the SEC’s pay versus performance rules in Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act (“Item 402(v)”)
and does not necessarily reflect value actually realized by the Named Executive Officers or how the Talent and Compensation Committee
evaluates compensation decisions in light of Company or individual performance. For discussion of how the Talent and Compensation
Committee seeks to align pay with performance when making compensation decisions, please review the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis beginning on page 53 . The following tables and related disclosures provide
information about (i) the total compensation (“SCT Total”) of our principal executive officer (“PEO”)
and our non-PEO Named Executive Officers (collectively, the “Other NEOs”) as presented in the Summary Compensation
Table on page 70 , (ii) the “compensation actually paid” (“CAP”) to our PEO and our Other NEOs,
as calculated pursuant to Item 402(v), (iii) certain financial performance measures, and (iv) the relationship of the CAP

    year. ** To determine the value of stock options included in CAP, the lattice valuation model was
    used, which differs from the Black-Scholes valuation model that was used at grant date. The lattice valuation model was deemed
    most appropriate because it is better able to value stock options at varying levels of stock price relative to the option
    exercise price and is consistent with valuation methodologies permitted under GAAP. Total Shareholder Return (Column (f); Column
(g)) Total shareholder return assumes that dividends
were reinvested on the day of issuance. Table of Contents 89 Peer Group Total Shareholder Return (Column (g)) The peer group used in this disclosure is the Dow
Jones Food & Beverage Total Return Index, which is the same peer group used in Part II, Item 5 of our Form 10-K. Net Income (Column (h)) Net Income as reported in the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Income included in our Form 10-K. Organic Revenue Growth (non-GAAP) (Column (i)) Organic revenue growth is referred to as “net
operating revenue growth” in our Named Executive Officers’ incentive programs (see page 58 in the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis). Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted
for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes, as applicable, and the impact of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. Organic revenue growth was determined to be the most important financial performance measure linking CAP to Company
performance for 2022 and therefore was selected as the 2022 “Company-Selected Measure” as defined in Item 402(v). Comparable Currency Neutral Operating Income
Growth (non-GAAP) (Supplemental Measure) (Column (j)) Comparable currency neutral operating income growth is referred to as “operating income growth” in our Named Executive Officers’ incentive programs (see page
58 in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis). Comparable currency neutral operating income growth (adjusted for structural
changes) is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability, the impact
of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the impact of structural changes, as applicable. Items impacting comparability
include asset impairments, transaction gains/losses, restructuring and other items. Structural changes generally refer to acquisitions
and divestitures of bottling operations, including the impact of intercompany transactions among our operating segments. The Company
has elected to present comparable currency neutral operating income growth, a supplemental measure, to assist in understanding
the changes in CAP over the fiscal years presented. Financial Performance Measures The following table lists the four financial performance
measures that, in the Company’s assessment, represent the most important performance measures used to link CAP for our Named
Executive Officers to Company performance for 2022. Organic Revenue Growth (non-GAAP) (Company-Selected Measure) Comparable Currency Neutral Operating Income Growth (non-GAAP) Comparable Currency Neutral Earnings Per Share Growth (non-GAAP) Cumulative Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) Table of Contents 90 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPENSATION ACTUALLY PAID
AND PERFORMANCE The graphs below show the relationship of “compensation
actually paid” to our PEO and Other NEOs to (i) the Company’s organic revenue growth (non-GAAP), (ii) the Company’s
comparable currency neutral operating income growth (non-GAAP), (iii) the Company’s net income and (iv) TSR of both the
Company and the Dow Jones Food & Beverage Total Return Index. CAP, as calculated in accordance with Item 402(v),
reflects, among others, adjustments to the fair value of equity awards during the years presented. Factors impacting the fair
value of equity awards include the price of our Common Stock at year end, as well as the projected and actual achievement of performance
goals. These adjustments contributed significantly to the change in CAP reported for 2020 to 2021. CAP VS. ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AND COMPARABLE CURRENCY NEUTRAL OPERATING INCOME GROWTH CAP VS. NET INCOME CAP VS. COMPANY TSR AND PEER GROUP TSR Table of Contents 91 Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Future Advisory Votes to Approve Executive Compensation 3 WHAT AM I VOTING ON? Shareowners are being provided the opportunity to vote on how often they believe we should hold an advisory vote to approve executive compensation in the future. The frequency options are to hold the advisory vote to approve executive compensation each year, every two years or every three years. The
                                         Board of Directors recommends ONE YEAR for
                                         the frequency of future advisory votes to approve executive compensation. In addition to the advisory vote
to approve executive compensation, we are also seeking a non-binding determination from our shareowners as to how often they believe
the advisory vote to approve executive compensation should be held in the future. When this advisory vote was last held in 2017,
shareowners indicated a preference to hold the advisory vote to approve executive compensation annually and the Board implemented
this standard. The Board continues to believe
that an annual advisory vote to approve executive compensation is the most appropriate policy for our shareowners and the Company
at this time. Although we recognize the potential benefits of having less frequent advisory votes to approve executive compensation,
we understand that an annual advisory vote is currently the standard desired by many shareowners. Regardless of the frequency of
the advisory vote to approve executive compensation, the Talent and Compensation Committee will remain committed to considering
feedback from shareowners as it continues to refine and evaluate the Company’s compensation programs. While the Board recommends an
annual advisory vote to approve executive compensation, the voting options are to hold the advisory vote to approve executive
compensation each year, every two years or every three years. Table of Contents 92 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 8 Audit Matters Report of the Audit Committee The Audit Committee operates under
a written charter adopted by the Board that outlines its responsibilities and the practices it follows. You can view the charter
on the Company’s website, www.coca-colacompany.com , by clicking on “Investors,” then “Corporate
Governance,” and then “Documents.” The Audit Committee reviews and assesses the adequacy of its charter at least
annually and, when appropriate, recommends to the Board changes to the charter to reflect the evolving role of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is composed
entirely of non-employee Directors who meet the independence and financial literacy requirements of the NYSE and additional, heightened
independence criteria applicable to members of the Audit Committee under SEC and NYSE rules. For 2022, the Board designated each
of David B. Weinberg and Christopher C. Davis as an “Audit Committee financial expert” under the SEC rules. PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES AND
2022 ACTIONS The Audit Committee represents
and assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to the integrity of the Company’s financial statements
and the financial reporting process, the systems of internal accounting and financial controls, the internal audit function and
the annual independent audit of the Company’s financial statements. The Audit Committee oversees the Company’s compliance
with legal and regulatory requirements; the Independent Auditors’ qualifications and independence; the performance of the
Company’s internal audit function and the Independent Auditors; the Company’s ethical compliance programs, including
the Company’s Codes of Business Conduct; the Company’s quality and food safety programs; workplace and distribution
safety programs; and information technology security programs. The Audit Committee also generally oversees the Company’s
overall ERM program and has direct oversight over financial reporting and controls and the Company’s product integrity assurance
and information technology security programs within the ERM framework. In addition, effective February 2023, the Audit Committee
has oversight over certain processes related to the Company’s external sustainability disclosures. At the request of the Audit Committee,
during some of its meetings, the Audit Committee participates in educational sessions on accounting and financial control matters,
cybersecurity and on areas of the Company’s operations, including some of the areas of risk it oversees. In 2022, the Audit Committee held
ten meetings, including one joint meeting with the former ESG and Public Policy Committee on the Company’s sustainability
reporting and the emerging regulatory environment. Meeting agendas are established by the Audit Committee Chair and the Chief
of Internal Audit. During 2022, among other things, the Audit Committee: ● met
                                         with the senior members of the Company’s financial management team at each regularly

                                         about topics requested by the Audit Committee, including one joint committee meeting
                                         with the former ESG and Public Policy Committee on the Company’s sustainability
                                         reporting and the emerging regulatory environment. OVERSIGHT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Audit Committee engaged Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s Independent Auditors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. In its meetings with
representatives of the Independent Auditors, the Audit Committee asks them to address, and discuss their responses to, several
questions that the Audit Committee believes are particularly relevant to its oversight. These questions include: ● Are
                                         there any significant accounting judgments or estimates made by management in preparing
                                         the financial statements that would have been made differently had the Independent Auditors
                                         prepared and been responsible for the financial statements? ● Based
                                         on the Independent Auditors’ experience and their knowledge of the Company, do
                                         the Company’s financial statements fairly present to investors, with clarity and
                                         completeness, the Company’s financial position and performance for the reporting
                                         period in accordance with GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements? ● Based
                                         on the Independent Auditors’ experience and their knowledge of the Company, has
                                         the Company implemented internal controls and internal audit procedures that are appropriate
                                         for the Company? The Audit Committee believes that
using these questions to help focus its discussions with the Independent Auditors promotes a more meaningful dialogue that provides
a basis for its oversight judgment. The Audit Committee also discussed
with the Independent Auditors those matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) and the SEC. The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from
the Independent Auditors required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the Independent Auditors’ communication
with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the Independent Auditors their independence. The Audit
Committee considered with the Independent Auditors whether the provision of non-audit services provided by them to the Company
during 2022 was compatible with their independence. Table of Contents 94 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 2022 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In its oversight role, the Audit
Committee relies on the work and assurances of the Company’s management, which has the responsibility for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for preparing the financial statements and other reports, and
of the Independent Auditors, who are engaged to audit and report on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has reviewed
and discussed with management and the Independent Auditors the audited financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of
the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant accounting judgments and estimates, and the clarity of disclosures
in the financial statements. In addressing the quality of management’s accounting judgments, members of the Audit Committee
asked for management’s representations and reviewed certifications prepared by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer that the unaudited quarterly and audited consolidated financial statements of the Company fairly present, in
all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, and have expressed to both
management and the auditors their general preference for conservative policies when a range of accounting options is available. In reliance on these reviews and
discussions, and the reports of the Independent Auditors, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board, and the Board has
approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2022 for filing with the SEC. DAVID

    are being asked to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, to serve as the Company’s
    Independent Auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. Although the Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint
    the Independent Auditors, as a matter of good corporate governance, the Board submits its selection of the Independent Auditors to
    our shareowners for ratification. If the shareowners should not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit Committee
    will reconsider the appointment. The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Independent Auditors. The Audit Committee has the sole authority
and responsibility to hire, evaluate and, when appropriate, replace the Company’s Independent Auditors and, in its capacity as
a committee of the Board, is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and general oversight of the work of the Independent
Auditors. The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) to serve as Independent Auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. EY (including its predecessors)
has served as the Company’s Independent Auditors since 1921. Table of Contents 96 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT ANNUAL EVALUATION AND SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS The Audit Committee annually evaluates the
performance of the Company’s Independent Auditors, including the senior audit engagement team, and determines whether to reengage
the current Independent Auditors or consider other audit firms. Factors considered by the Audit Committee in deciding whether to retain
the current Independent Auditors include: ● EY’s
    global capabilities; ● EY’s technical expertise
    and knowledge of the Company’s global operations and industry; ● the quality and candor
    of EY’s communications with the Audit Committee and management; ● EY’s independence; ● the quality and efficiency
    of the services provided by EY, including input from management on EY’s performance and how effectively EY demonstrated its
    independent judgment, objectivity and professional skepticism; ● external data on audit
    quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on EY and its peer firms; and ● the appropriateness of
    EY’s fees, EY’s tenure as Independent Auditors, including the benefits of a longer tenure, and the controls and processes
    in place that help ensure EY’s continued independence. Benefits of Longer Tenure Enhanced
    audit quality – EY’s significant institutional knowledge and deep expertise of the Company’s global business,
    accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting enhance audit quality. Competitive fees –
    Because of EY’s familiarity with the Company, audit and other fees are competitive with peer companies. Avoid costs associated
    with a new auditor – Bringing on new Independent Auditors would be costly and require a significant time commitment, which
    could lead to management distractions. Independence Controls Audit Committee
    oversight – Oversight includes regular private sessions with EY, discussion with EY about the scope of audit and business
    imperatives, a comprehensive annual evaluation when determining whether to reengage EY and direct involvement by the Audit Committee
    and its Chair in the selection of the new lead assurance engagement partner and new global coordinating partner in connection with
    the mandated rotation of these positions. Limits on non-audit
    services – The Audit Committee pre-approves audit and permissible non-audit services provided by EY in accordance with
    its pre-approval policy. EY’s internal
    independence process – EY conducts periodic internal reviews of its audit and other work, assesses the adequacy of partners
    and other personnel working on the Company’s account and rotates the lead assurance engagement partner, the global coordinating
    partner and other partners on the engagement consistent with independence requirements. A new lead assurance engagement partner was
    appointed in 2022, and a new global coordinating partner will be appointed in 2024. Strong regulatory framework – EY, as an independent registered public accounting firm, is subject to PCAOB inspections, “Big 4” peer reviews
    and PCAOB and SEC oversight. Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee
and the Board believe that retaining EY to serve as Independent Auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 is in the best
interests of the Company and its shareowners. Table of Contents 97 AUDIT FEES AND ALL OTHER FEES The Audit Committee is responsible for approving
the audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Independent Auditors and the associated fees. The following table shows the fees for audit
and other services provided by EY for fiscal years 2022 and 2021. 2022 Fees (In thousands) 2021 Fees (In thousands) Description Audit Fees $31,292 $29,316 Includes fees associated with the annual audit and the
    audit of internal control over financial reporting, registration statements in 2022 and 2021, the reviews of the Company’s
    Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and statutory audits required internationally. Audit-Related Fees 2,878 2,861 Fees for services that are reasonably related to the
    performance of the audit or review of financial statements and are not included in “Audit Fees.” These services principally
    include due diligence in connection with acquisitions, carve-out audits, consultation on accounting and internal control matters,
    information systems audits and other attest services. Tax Fees 7,686 7,756 Fees for tax services,
    including tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. All Other Fees 757 695 Fees for services that are not included in the above
    categories and primarily include benchmarking services. TOTAL $42,613 $40,628 AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT
AND PERMISSIBLE NON-AUDIT SERVICES OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit
and permissible non-audit services provided by the Independent Auditors. These services may include audit services, audit-related services,
tax services and other services. The Audit Committee has adopted a policy for the pre-approval of services provided by the Independent
Auditors. Under the policy, pre-approval is generally
provided for work associated with the following: ● registration statements under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended (for example, comfort letters or consents); ● statutory or other financial audit work for non-U.S.
    subsidiaries that is not required for the 1934 Act audits; ● due diligence work for potential acquisitions or dispositions; ● attest services not required by statute or regulation; ● adoption of new accounting pronouncements or auditing
    and disclosure requirements for financial or non-financial data and accounting or regulatory consultations; ● internal control reviews and assistance with internal
    control reporting requirements; ● review of information systems security and controls; ● tax compliance, tax planning and related tax services,
    excluding any tax service prohibited by regulatory or other oversight authorities, expatriate and other individual tax services;
    and ● assistance and consultation on questions raised by regulatory
    agencies. For each proposed service, the Independent
Auditors provide the Audit Committee with a description of the service and sufficient information to confirm the Independent Auditors’
determination that the provision of such service will not impair the Independent Auditors’ independence. The Audit Committee has approved in advance
certain permitted services whose scope is routine across operating units, including statutory or other financial audit work for non-U.S.
subsidiaries that is not required for the 1934 Act audits. OTHER INFORMATION The Company has been advised by EY that
neither the firm, nor any covered person of the firm, has any financial interest, direct or indirect, in any capacity in the Company
or its subsidiaries. One or more representatives of EY will be
present at the 2023 Annual Meeting. The representatives will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will
be available to respond to appropriate questions. Ratification of the appointment of EY as
Independent Auditors requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the shares of Common Stock voting
in person or by proxy at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Table of Contents 98 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 9 Shareowner Proposals Shareowner Proposals 5-9 WHAT
 AM I VOTING ON? The following proposals were submitted by shareowners. If the shareowner proponent of each proposal, or a representative who is qualified under state law, is present and submits the proposal for a vote, then the proposal will be voted on at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Each shareowner proponent was offered the opportunity to pre-record the presentation of their proposal. In the event not all shareowner proponents elect to pre-record their presentation, in the discretion of the Chairman, the shareowner proposals may be presented out of order at the 2023 Annual Meeting to seek to avoid any technical issues with switching between live and pre-recorded presentations. In accordance with federal securities regulations, we included the shareowner proposal plus any supporting statements exactly as submitted by the proponent. The proposals may contain assertions about the Company or other matters that we believe are incorrect, but we have not attempted to refute all of those assertions. To make sure readers can easily distinguish between materials provided by the proponent and materials provided by the Company, we have placed a black box around the materials provided by the proponent and a red box around materials provided by the Company. Information contained on or accessible through any website links included in the proposals, supporting statements, and the responses from our Board is not incorporated in, and does not constitute a part of, this Proxy Statement. If proposals are submitted by more than one shareowner, we will list only the primary filer’s name, address and stock ownership. We will furnish the name, address and stock ownership of all co-filing proponents upon written request to the Corporate Secretary. The
                                         Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST each
                                         of the shareowner proposals. Table of Contents 99 Shareowner
Proposal Requesting an Audit of the Company’s Impact on Nonwhite Stakeholders 5 Service Employees International Union Pension Plans Master Trust, 1800 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Suite 301, Washington, DC 20036, the beneficial owner for at least three years of Company Common Stock having a market value of at least $2,000, submitted the following proposal. RESOLVED, shareholders request
    that The Coca-Cola Company (“Coca-Cola”) conduct and publish a third-party audit (within a reasonable time, at a reasonable
    cost, and excluding confidential/proprietary information) to review its corporate policies, practices, products, and services, above
    and beyond legal and regulatory matters, and assess their impact on nonwhite stakeholders. Input from stakeholders, including civil
    rights organizations, employees, and customers, should be considered in determining the specific matters to be assessed, and the
    audit should include recommendations for preventing and mitigating adverse impacts. Pay equity analysis by race, which Coca-Cola
    will analyze in a separate study, need not be included in the audit. A report on the audit, prepared at reasonable cost and omitting
    confidential/proprietary information, should be published on the Company’s website. SUPPORTING STATEMENT The racial justice movement, coupled with the disproportionate
    impacts of COVID-19 on communities of color, have amplified calls for institutions to advance racial equity. Racial inequity, including
    racist and discriminatory policies and practices, may present significant legal, financial, and reputational business risks. In response
    to George Floyd’s murder, Coca-Cola’s CEO said: “as a company that believes diversity and inclusion are among our
    greatest strengths, we must put our resources and energy toward helping end the cycle of systemic racism.” 1 Research has found that the most racially diverse and
    inclusive companies are more likely to outperform less diverse peers in terms of profitability. 2 While Coca-Cola has recently
    announced a Racial Equity Action Plan, 3 there are concerns around workforce commitments to racial equity that have reversed
    previously positive trends. Between 2010 and 2020, the proportion of Coca-Cola’s executives that were Black was nearly halved,
    from 15% to 8%, and the Company’s Black salaried staff also slipped by 5%. 4 Additionally, Coca-Cola’s Racial Equity Action
    Plan does not address potential racial equity issues in its products, and some of Coca-Cola’s advertising and marketing practices
    have faced backlash from stakeholders. The Company’s most recent make-your-own label promotion prevented users from creating
    “Black Lives Matter” labels, while allowing the printing of “White Lives Matter” labels. 5 A 2018 study from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and
    Obesity found that Coca-Cola has increased its sugary drink advertising spending by 81% since 2013, disproportionately targeting
    Hispanic and Black communities. 6 It found that Black children and teens were exposed to twice as many advertisements than
    white youth. 7 Increasing rates of diet-related diseases, disproportionately impacting Black and Hispanic teens, have intensified
    calls for healthier products and more robust responsible marketing practices. 8 Table of Contents 100 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT A racial equity audit is an important step
in establishing a transparent system of accountability. An audit conducted by a third party has the additional advantage of providing
objectivity, assurance and specialized expertise beyond what would be possible with an internal analysis. 1 https://www.coca-colacompany.com/news/where-we-stand-on-social-justice 2 https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters 3 https://www.coca-colacompany.com/social-impact/diversity-and-inclusion/racial-equity/our-plan 4 https://www.wsj.com/articles/coke-resets-goal-of-boosting-black-employees-after-20-year-effort-loses-ground-11608139999 5 https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/23/business/coke-label-fail/index.html 6 https://media.ruddcenter.uconn.edu/PDFs/Sugary_Drink_FACTS_Full%20Report.pdf 7 https://www.fastcompany.com/90520068/obesity-researchers-say-coke-and-pepsi-should-stop-targeting-communities-of-color-with-ads 8 https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/01/01/briefs-obesity010121 THE BOARD’S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION
TO ITEM 5 The Board of Directors has carefully considered
this shareowner proposal and recommends that shareowners vote AGAINST it. While we respect the intentions of the proponents,
we are recommending a vote against the proposal because The Coca-Cola Company is already taking meaningful action in addressing the overarching
issues raised in the proposal, and the Board and management continually review and publicly report on the Company’s policies and
practices as would be the purpose of the proposed audit. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)
is integral to the Company’s long-term success and to our efforts to support and strengthen our workplace and the communities we
serve. Cultivating a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace is a strategic business priority. We push ourselves to think boldly about
the actions we take inside our Company as well as in the communities we call home. To cultivate diversity, equity and inclusion
in our workplace and communities, we are taking a number of steps: Starting at the top . Our commitment
to DEI starts with our Board of Directors. The Board is committed to advancing racial equity and establishes expectations for achievement.
Our Board fully appreciates the importance of effectively identifying and managing potential DEI risks, and we understand that DEI risks
have the potential to extend beyond the Company’s workforce. The Board, through its Talent and Compensation Committee, reviews
our DEI plans and progress at least twice a year. The full Board receives reports on the Committee’s work. Empowering a system-wide networked team .
Our CEO, executive officers and a networked team of leaders across the Coca-Cola system work closely with our DEI team, led by our Chief
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, to lead the Company’s global DEI strategy. Incentivizing DEI . In February 2022,
the Board approved plans to embed predefined quantitative and qualitative DEI components into our compensation programs for our executive
officers to further align our executive officers with our priority issues and reinforce accountability. Disclosing our progress and committing
to increasing transparency and disclosure . Our DEI efforts are detailed in our most recent Business & ESG Report, which can be
found on our website. We publicly disclose gender globally and U.S. race/ ethnicity by level, a practice that we will continue annually.
In addition, the Company also publicly discloses data submitted annually to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEO-1
Report”). To provide further external validation for
the race/ethnicity data, we engaged Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, for the first time in 2021-22
to provide limited level assurance on select DEI metrics. Table of Contents 101 Aspiring to mirror the markets
that we serve . In 2021, we announced two 2030 representation aspirations: to be 50% led by women globally and, in the U.S., to mirror
the census for race/ethnicity at all job grade levels. ● To meet these aspirations, we have
    developed multi-year strategies that include refreshed recruitment approaches, expanding our diversity sourcing efforts, and requiring
    diverse interview panels and candidate slates before making a hiring decision. ● We are focused on refreshing our early career and professional
    recruiting strategy in a way that will allow us to expand our candidate reach to include more underrepresented talent. ● We continue to expand our talent and development efforts
    by investing in targeted programs and strategic partnerships to advance and retain underrepresented associates. We recently launched
    the Next Generation sponsorship program, which focuses on women employees in our mid-level job roles. Identifying breakthrough initiatives .
We recently launched three new Equity Accountability Councils (“EACs”) in North America. The EACs will help identify breakthrough
initiatives that can be catalysts for sustainable progress in under-resourced communities – with emphasis on economic equity across
Asian Pacific, Black and Hispanic communities. Each EAC includes a cross-section of thought leaders across non-profit, industry and private
sectors along with leadership from our Coca-Cola system. EAC members were carefully selected based on their expertise in their respective
fields and ability to push the Coca-Cola system toward meaningful changes. Building equitable practices .
We routinely conduct pay equity analyses to ensure associates in similarly positioned jobs are paid fairly for their work, without regard
to gender (globally) or race/ethnicity (in the United States). This ongoing process gives us confidence that our pay structures are equitable
and provides the data to support adjustments if issues arise. We are focused on plans to evolve our pay equity analysis beyond the U.S.
and to look beyond levels of base pay to broader aspects of Total Rewards. Focusing on Inclusion . We
created an Inclusion Index by embedding inclusion-related questions throughout our 2022 Culture & Engagement Survey to gather insights
on employee sentiments of belonging, fairness, respect, and psychological safety. We continue to focus on building inclusive leadership
skills as a core capability and are embedding inclusive leadership into all parts of our development curricula. Advancing Racial Equity and Social
Justice in Communities . Over the past few years, The Coca-Cola Company and The Coca-Cola Foundation collectively gave more than $6
million in grants, donations, and employee matching gifts to support organizations focused on social justice. Supplier Diversity Supplier diversity is an integral component
of The Coca-Cola Company’s diversity management strategy, and we believe that promoting inclusion in our procurement strategy helps
develop stronger local communities and creates long-term growth and a competitive advantage for the Coca-Cola system. Within our organization,
“supplier diversity” is defined as businesses that are 51% owned, operated and/or controlled by one or more women, ethnic
minorities, LGBTQ person(s) or veterans. Our ambitions . The Company
spent approximately $675 million with diverse suppliers in 2018 and spent approximately $800 million in both 2020 and 2021. 2022 supplier
diversity spend was approximately $900 million, and we have an ambitious goal to increase this metric to $1 billion in annual spending
through our supplier diversity program. This program continues to focus on existing as well as new partners — from warehousing
and construction engineering to transportation and facilities management, from information technology to marketing and media. Focus on media . Recognizing
that minority-owned businesses faced some of the most significant economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2021, we announced plans
to nearly double our spending with minority-owned media companies over the next three years in North America. This means that Black,
Hispanic and Asian American and Pacific Islander owned and led media companies and partners will increase to account for 8% of our total
annual media budget in North America by 2024. Value chain impact . Leveraging
our impact on the worldwide supply chain in the industry, the Company also encourages suppliers to adopt diversity programs and goes
beyond the beverage industry to increase overall corporate supplier diversity. Our efforts have been recognized externally due to our
program’s innovative approach to promoting minority supplier development across our value chain. Table of Contents 102 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Women’s Economic Empowerment In 2010, The Coca-Cola Company publicly announced a global
initiative to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women by 2020 through the Company’s 5by20 ® program. The
Company was one of the first private sector entities to announce a goal of this magnitude. By the end of 2020, the Company, working together
with its partners, including The Coca-Cola Foundation, enabled the economic empowerment of over 6 million women in diverse businesses,
across 100 countries, delivered through over 300 programs. Beneficiaries of the program were largely women in startup or growing small
business operations, with an emphasis on women operating in vulnerable communities around the world. In the United States alone, we enabled
the economic empowerment of over 1 million women, largely drawn from minority populations by working with various external implementing
partners to build business and financial literacy skills and to support access to finance and mentorship networks. We remain committed
to the economic empowerment of women and minority populations across our value chain, and we continue to run programs in several of our
markets around the world. Driving Growth of Our Zero-Calorie
Portfolio Across All Consumer Segments, including Communities of Color The Coca-Cola Company is responding to consumers’
growing desire for more choices with less sugar and more drinks with nutrition benefits. For example, we are optimizing our mix of products;
offering more small packaging choices; promoting our zero-calorie beverages; providing consumers with clear nutrition information; and
abiding by responsible marketing practices. Over the past four years, we have reformulated more than 1,100 beverages to reduce added
sugars through recipe changes and package size changes, resulting in the removal of approximately 900,000 tons of added sugar. In 2021,
our mini cans in North America grew by 10%, offering portion control to consumers. We also launched the new 13.2 oz “sip”
bottle to provide consumers with a smaller portion size in a resealable container. This proposal fails to recognize that The
Coca-Cola Company is transforming its portfolio and making meaningful changes in its business to provide consumers with more beverage
choices, including more beverages with less added sugar. As part of our overall strategy, the Company is seeking to grow its sales of
low and no-calorie beverages through specific marketing communications targeted to all consumers, including communities of color. In
2022, the Company used several of its key U.S. sponsorships to grow sales of low and no-calorie beverages, including: ● NCAA Final Four Tournament: As the
    lead brand, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar was featured in stores, billboards, and on-site (both men’s and women’s tournament activations in
    New Orleans and Minneapolis), as well as in two television ads featuring legendary basketball players Julius Erving (“Dr. J”),
    former Philadelphia Sixer and NBA legend, and Lisa Leslie, WNBA legend, along with current players Joel Embiid and Breanna Stewart. ● In the third quarter of 2022, Sprite Zero Sugar announced
    its first major cinematic collaboration, partnering with “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” to engage the next generation
    of consumers and champion underrepresented creators of color. ● Since water is one of the Company’s key beverage categories,
    we began working with Zendaya, a top fashion influencer globally, to help develop the smartwater brand. In addition, smartwater also
    engaged Alex Toussaint, a popular Black fitness instructor, to help promote the smartwater alkaline brand. ● Finally, in 2022, Lil Nas X began working with the vitaminwater
    brand in television ads featuring Zero Sugar flavors XXX, Ice, Shine and Gutsy. Responsible Marketing and Sugar Reduction As a global company, we understand that
people around the world have an increased interest in managing the food and beverages they consume. Concerns about obesity and health
mean people now want additional drinks with more nutrition and benefits, and often less sugar. The Company is listening to consumers,
and we are one of the few companies to publicly support the recommendation by several leading health authorities that people should limit
their intake of added sugar to no more than 10% of their total daily calorie consumption. This proposal implies that our Company is
somehow not a responsible player in the health and nutrition space. We disagree strongly with this and do not think the implication is
supported by the facts as presented in this response. Our Company fully understands that people should not eat or drink too much sugar.
We have responded by taking meaningful action to embrace evolving preferences and give our consumers more of the drinks they want. Part
of our approach is to engage with and listen to public health stakeholders to inform our policies and business actions. Our public disclosures
on these and other initiatives can be found on our website and our annual Business & ESG Report. Table of Contents 103 Responsible Marketing We are committed to the responsible marketing
of our products, and we have a history of aligning our commercial practices with our sustainability and business goals. Our Responsible
Marketing Policy clearly states that we will respect the role of parents and caregivers by not marketing directly to children under 13.
Our policy applies to all of our products, regardless of nutritional profile, as we honor the rights of parents and caregivers to make
choices for themselves and their children. Our approach to marketing is consistent with the International Chamber of Commerce Marketing & Advertising Code and its Framework for Responsible Food and Beverage Marketing Communication. We support these guiding principles
across all of our marketing communications. Our Responsible Marketing Policy is non-discriminatory and does not target consumers based
on race or ethnicity. Sugar Reduction Efforts Following are some of the actions we have
been taking: ● We are one of the only companies to
    support the recommendation of leading health authorities that people should limit their intake of added sugar to no more than 10%
    of their total calorie intake per day. ● Over the past four years, we have reformulated more than
    1,100 beverages to reduce added sugars through recipe changes and package size changes, resulting in the removal of approximately
    900,000 tons of added sugar. 38% of our beverage portfolio is low- or no-sugar and 29% of our global volume is low- or no-calorie. ● We are helping consumers control their added sugar intake
    by reducing portion size and providing smaller packages for our full calorie beverages. 41% of our sparkling brands now come in packages
    8.5 ounces or less, and approximately two-thirds of the products in our portfolio have less than 100 calories per 12-ounce serving. ● To support continued development of low- and no-sugar
    beverage options, we recently reported that The Coca-Cola Company has invested more than $100 million in sweetener innovation and
    sugar reduction research since 2008. We have been joined in such efforts by other members of the food, beverage, and ingredient industries,
    which collectively have invested more than $1 billion during this same period. ● We participate in more than 40 calorie/sugar reduction
    pledges across the globe. One such initiative is the Balance Calories Initiative (“BCI”), which is a commitment by The
    Coca-Cola Company and key industry peers to reduce per-person beverage calories by 20% by 2025 across the United States. In early
    February 2022, Keybridge LLC, an independent evaluator, released its annual report on progress against the BCI, which evaluated five
    select communities against baselines established in 2014-2015. The report found that, through 2020, average calories per 8-ounce
    serving decreased between 10% and 15.5% in all five communities, which is about half-way to our 2025 goal. In addition to industry
    sugar reduction pledges in Europe, Mexico and Turkey, earlier this year in Australia the Coca-Cola system joined industry partners
    in pledging to reduce the sugar content in their nonalcoholic beverage portfolios by 25% by 2025, as part of an updated industry-wide
    pledge announced by the Australian Beverages Council, an increase on the 2018 Sugar Reduction pledge to reduce the sugar content
    by 20% by 2025. Additional auditing and reporting in this
area would be redundant because the Access to Nutrition Foundation (“ATNF”), a respected independent nonprofit organization,
already produces credible reports covering our Company that encompass sugar and public health, and these reports address the essential
objectives sought by the proposal. ATNF is based in the Netherlands and funded by third parties, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the UK Department for International Development, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. ATNF has noted our progress over the years
as one of the few companies that has consistently improved its performance in the ATNF’s well-respected global Access to Nutrition
Index (the “ATNI Global Index”). The ATNI Global Index was first released in 2013 and was updated in 2016, 2018 and 2021,
each time with input from the Company. The ATNI Global Index assesses the Company’s policies and products with regard to nutrition
and sugar. The 2022 ATNI U.S. spotlight report acknowledged that “30% of distinct products analysed met the ‘healthy’
threshold” (3.5 stars or more in the Health Stars Rating). When taking category sales values into account, the Company was estimated
to derive 34% of its 2021 U.S. retail sales from healthier products. A link to the ATNI Global Index can be found at https://accesstonutrition.org/index/global-index-2021/. Table of Contents 104 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT As we have stated, we are already taking meaningful action in addressing the overarching issues raised in the proposal, and we already regularly review the Company’s policies, practices and goals as would be the purpose of the proposed audit. Therefore, we do not think it is in the best interests of the business or our shareowners to divert resources from ongoing DEI actions and commitments and apply them toward an audit that would not yield meaningful enhancements to the Company’s existing practices and robust public disclosures. The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareowner proposal requesting an audit of the Company’s impact on nonwhite stakeholders. Table of Contents 105 Shareowner Proposal Requesting a Global Transparency Report 6 John C. Harrington, President and CEO, Harrington Investments,
Inc., 1001 2nd Street, Suite 325, Napa, California 94559, the beneficial owner for at least three years of 100 shares of Company Common
Stock, submitted the following proposal. Global Transparency Report RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Company annually issue a transparency report on global public policy and political influence,
disclosing company expenditures and activities outside of the United States. Such report should disclose company funding and
in-kind support directed to candidates or electioneering, lobbying, and any charitable donations directed to public policy
research or influence for the preceding year including: ● Recipients and amounts. ● The Company’s membership in or payments
    to nongovernmental organizations including trade and business associations, scientific or academic organizations and charities. ● The rationale for these activities. The Board and
management may, in its discretion, establish a de minimis threshold, such as contributions to an individual or organization totaling
less than $250, below which itemized disclosures would not be required. Supporting
statement: Coke statements
indicate they value transparency: “Public Disclosures:
We strive to be as transparent as possible, in all aspects of our business. This includes our public policy engagement activity.” However, Coke’s spending
to influence and engage on public policy outside the United States is minimal and inconsistently disclosed. A truly global corporation,
Coke is the world’s largest beverage company and operates in approximately 200 countries. 1 As of 2019, Coke products
were sold in all countries but Cuba and North Korea. 2 Despite the
global scope of operations, our company does not currently comprehensively disclose its involvement in politics and advocacy on public
policies outside of the United States. Coke
scores low regarding international disclosures of corporate political activities, according to a recent transparency index. 3 Despite the corporation’s expansive global operations, there is minimal disclosure of and transparency around international
political activity. In most cases, regional and country web pages offer codes of conduct in lieu of disclosures. When there are
limited disclosures, details requested in this resolution, such as amounts paid and for what explicit purpose are absent. Table of Contents 106 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Vanguard
                                         recently cautioned “poor governance of corporate political activity, coupled with
                                         misalignment to a company’s stated strategy or a lack of transparency about the
                                         activity, can manifest into financial, legal, and reputational risks that can affect
                                         long term value”. 4 In the food industry, a
particular arena of abuse is support for scientific advocacy intended to shape policy maker perceptions and influence policy making,
regulations and rule setting. Coke funded the global industry lobby group International Life Sciences Institute to produce research
that has helped slow, or stall altogether, public health policy in India, Mexico, China, and Brazil. 5 And as of 2021,
Coke funded entities like the Calorie Control Council, which has a history of leveraging covert public relations tactics. 6 Food corporations
like Coke rely heavily on consumer trust, brand affinity and public goodwill. These days, public officials, journalists, nongovernmental
organizations, and social media can quickly and publicly reveal corporate activity that seems highly oppositional to a company’s
image, brand or stated values. Vote

STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO ITEM 6 The Board of Directors has carefully considered this shareowner proposal
and recommends that shareowners vote AGAINST it. The Company
already discloses the type of information being requested and additional disclosures beyond the Company’s existing, robust reporting
would be redundant and unnecessary. This proposal
requests that the Company provide additional disclosures on expenditures and activities outside of the United States, including Company
funding and in-kind support directed to candidates or electioneering, lobbying, and any charitable donations directed to public policy
research or influence. The proponent claims in this proposal that our Company “does not currently comprehensively disclose its
involvement in politics and advocacy on public policies outside of the United States.” The facts do
not support this claim. First, it is
important to note that the Company’s political giving outside of the United States is very minimal. In 2022, our international
political contributions totaled less than $20,000, and were limited to costs to attend political party conferences in the United Kingdom
and Australia. Coca-Cola engages
in direct advocacy outside of the United States in order to share information and perspective on our public policy priorities. As is
the case in the United States, the Company discloses our political giving as required by law in the countries where we operate. In the
past two years, the Company has not made a monetary contribution to an individual politician outside of the United States. The limited
contributions we made have been restricted to political parties. The Company
follows all national laws regarding political engagement and, as stated above, discloses political contributions according to each country’s
legal framework and through the relevant national regulatory authorities. For example: ● Outside of the United States, our Company is included in the EU Transparency Register, a publicly accessible database that lists organizations who seek to influence the law-making and policy implementation process of EU institutions. Table of Contents 107 ● In the United Kingdom, there is no legal requirement for businesses to disclose political contributions. The Company paid registration fees to attend Conservative and Labour political conferences, totaling nearly £1,500. ● We also provide similar public disclosures in Australia. Details of donations above a mandated threshold are provided in Australia on the Australian Electoral Commission website. The annual disclosure threshold in Australia is combined donations to a single party of more than $AUD14,000. We did not meet this federal reporting threshold in 2022; however, we contributed the annual fee for membership of the Federal Labor Business Forum and an annual fee for membership of the Tasmanian Liberal Party Leaders Forum. The Labor membership fee can be found on the Federal Labor Business Forum site as Labor voluntarily discloses contributions above $AUD1,000. Even though our Company adheres to the required disclosure
practices as outlined above, we have considered the proponent’s position and have enhanced our disclosure of non-U.S. political
contributions. We now post these contributions in the same place on our website where U.S. political contributions are posted. We believe
this will be more user-friendly for interested stakeholders to access this information. As shareowners are considering the proposal, please also consider that
our Company’s work in this area has been positively recognized by external parties. In 2022, the Company was again recognized
as a “Trendsetter” in the Center for Political Accountability (CPA)-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure
and Accountability. 1 The Company received its highest score to date of 95.7%. The Index is produced by CPA annually
in conjunction with the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. The
Index seeks to encourage responsible corporate political activity, protect shareholders, and strengthen the integrity of the political
process. Based on publicly available information, the Index measures performance in three areas: disclosure, company political
spending decision-making policies, and board oversight and accountability policies. The proposal also mentions scientific and academic
organizations. The Company already issues on a regular basis one of our industry’s leading disclosures in its Transparency
Research Report. 2 1 https://www.politicalaccountability.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-CPA-Zicklin-Index.pdf 2 https://www.coca-colacompany.com/content/dam/journey/us/en/policies/pdf/research-and-studies/transparency-research-report.pdf (as of March 29, 2022). The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareowner proposal requesting a global transparency report. Table of Contents 108 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Shareowner
        Proposal Regarding Political Expenditures Values Alignment 7 Clean Yield Asset Management, PO Box 874, 16 Beaver Meadow Rd., Norwich, VT 05055, as representative of Julie Kalish, the beneficial owner for at least three years of shares of Company Common Stock having a market value of at least $2,000, submitted the following proposal. Whereas: Coca-Cola Company
has stated “[t]here is overwhelming evidence that achieving equality and empowerment for women has broad ripple effects that are
good for society.” Criteria for
political contributions to candidates from the Coca-Cola PAC include the recipient’s “support for workforce equality and
inclusion” and demonstration of “a strong record for environmental sustainability.” However, several
of Coca-Cola’s politically focused expenditures in the U.S. appear to be misaligned with these stated criteria and other organizational
values otherwise conveyed through its activities and statements: ● In 2021, Coca-Cola faced boycotts
    and social media censure when it was perceived as being supportive of legislation in Georgia restricting voting rights. This perception
    was linked to Coca-Cola’s donations to 29 co-sponsors of the legislation (https://bit.ly/3G1prgc). CEO James Quincey later
    stated that Coca-Cola viewed voting as a “foundational right,” yet the Company donated to state officials who voted for
    laws restricting access to voting in the 2022 election cycle (https://bit. ly/3Tog6lQ). ● Coca-Cola committed to recover for recycling all the
    bottles it sells and to use 50% recycled content by 2030. Yet, the company has spent millions of dollars to oppose passage of container
    deposit laws, which have proven to significantly increase recycling rates. ● In the 2020-22 election cycles, the Proponent estimates
    that Coca-Cola has given more than $1.8 million to politicians and political organizations seeking to limit access to reproductive
    health care. ● Following the storming of the U.S. Capitol, Coca-Cola stated, “We
    are all stunned by the unlawful and violent events that unfolded in Washington, D.C.,” and declared a pause in political
    giving of unknown duration. Yet Coke subsequently donated to federal lawmakers who opposed creating a Congressional January
    6 th investigation. The Company
and its investors would benefit by strengthening its policies and reporting systems to avoid future missteps in corporate electioneering
and political spending that contrast with its stated diversity and environmental policies. Such an approach is likely to reduce risk
to Coca-Cola’s brand and reputation. Resolved: Shareholders request that Coca-Cola publish a report, at reasonable expense, analyzing the congruency of its political and electioneering
expenditures in the U.S. during the preceding year against its publicly stated company values and policies, listing and explaining any
instances of incongruent expenditures, and stating whether the Company plans to make changes in contributions or communications to candidates
as a result of the identified incongruencies. Supporting
Statement: The proponents
recommend, at Board discretion, that such report also include management’s analysis of risks to our Company’s brand, reputation, or shareholder
value of expenditures in conflict with the Company’s publicly stated values. “Expenditures for electioneering communications”
means spending directly, or through a third party, at any time during the year, on printed, internet, or broadcast communications, which
are reasonably susceptible to interpretation as being in support of or in opposition to a specific candidate. Table of Contents 109 THE BOARD’S
STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO ITEM 7 The Board of Directors has carefully considered this shareowner proposal
and recommends that shareowners vote AGAINST it. We believe
the existing policies and practices governing the Company’s political spending, including our recently developed contribution criteria
and enhanced disclosure regime, adequately address the issues raised in this proposal. The Board of
Directors believes participation in the political process provides an important means for The Coca-Cola Company to protect the interests
of the Company, our employees, and our shareowners. By sharing our views, constructive arguments, and informed perspectives with policymakers,
we can have a positive impact on the policy decisions that directly impact our business and our employees. Furthermore,
the Board recognizes that in today’s environment, not every shareowner will agree with every decision the Company makes in this
area, as is the case with this proponent. But shareowners have elected the Board to oversee the business of the Company, which includes
setting and overseeing policies on political advocacy to promote the Company’s interests. We have instituted a Political Engagement
Policy with that in mind, which helps ensure our political activities are aligned with our Company’s values and vision for success. One of the
ways our Company engages in the political process is by financially supporting candidates for office. When we make political contributions,
we consider whether the candidate: ● Champions policy issues related to Coca-Cola business interests; ● Represents districts or states with significant Coca-Cola system presence; ● Holds a leadership position or seat in committees key to Coca-Cola business priorities; ● Supports equality and inclusion aligned to our strategic imperatives for a diverse workplace; and ● Demonstrates a strong record for environmental sustainability in areas that align with our priorities. Importantly, we consider all these criteria , not just one or two standards. The intent
behind our engagement with these policy makers is to create an environment in which we can have constructive conversations about the
issues that matter to us. In doing that, we support political candidates based on the criteria listed above, who take reasonable positions
on policies that affect our long-term business objectives. Of course, support does not mean that we agree with their positions on all
issues. Over the years,
we believe transparency and accountability have been hallmarks of our political engagement activities. We have for some time voluntarily
disclosed our political activity on the Company’s external website. And, importantly, a committee of the Board has for years overseen
the Company’s public policy advocacy, including political spending policies and practices. Even so, we
are continually seeking to improve our policies, practices and disclosures. The Board spends considerable time evaluating the Company’s
policies and practices governing political engagement to ensure that they meet the needs of our business and deliver value to shareowners. In 2022, we created a newly
designed external Public Policy and Political Engagement webpage, 1 with updated policies, disclosures, and political
giving criteria. Our key advocacy areas are now more clearly outlined to reflect the connection to our business priorities and
values. On this site, we publish in greater detail our U.S.-based trade associations and social welfare groups, along with lobbying
expenditures. A report of the kind recommended is unnecessary given the transparency the Company already provides to shareowners
and the public. The process the Company
uses and the transparency it provides has been recognized by accountability organizations, as well. In 2022, the Company was again
recognized as a “Trendsetter” in the Center for Political Accountability (CPA)-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political
Disclosure and Accountability, and the Company received its highest score to date of 95.7%. 2 The Index is produced
by CPA annually in conjunction with the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania. The Index seeks to encourage responsible corporate political activity, protect shareholders, and strengthen the
integrity of the political process. Based on publicly available information, the Index measures performance in three areas: disclosure,
company political spending decision-making policies, and board oversight and accountability policies. Table of Contents 110 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT For these reasons, we believe that the production of a report as recommended
in this proposal is unnecessary. 1 https://www.coca-colacompany.com/policies-and-practices/public-policy-and-political-engagement 2 https://www.politicalaccountability.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-CPA-Zicklin-Index.pdf The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareowner proposal regarding political expenditures values alignment. Table of Contents 111 Shareowner
        Proposal Requesting an Independent Board Chair Policy 8 National Legal and Policy
Center, 107 Park Washington Court, Falls Church, Virginia 22046, the beneficial owner for at least three years of 96 shares of Company
Common Stock, submitted the following proposal. Request for
Board of Directors to Adopt Policy for an Independent Chair RESOLVED: Shareholders
request the Board of Directors adopt as policy, and amend the governing documents as necessary, to require hereafter that the two separate
people hold the office of the Chairman and the office of the CEO as follows: Selection of the Chairman of the Board: The Board requires the separation
of the offices of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. Whenever possible,
the Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent Director. The Board may
select a Temporary Chairman of the Board who is not an Independent Director to serve while the Board seeks an Independent Chairman of
the Board. The Chairman
shall not be a former CEO of the company. Selection of
the Chairman of the Board shall be consistent with applicable law and existing contracts. SUPPORTING
STATEMENT: The Chief Executive
Officer of The Coca-Cola Company is also Board Chairman. We believe these roles – each with separate, different responsibilities
that are critical to the health of a successful corporation – are greatly diminished when held by a singular company official,
thus weakening its governance structure. Expert perspectives
substantiate our position: ● According to the Council of Institutional Investors (https://bit.ly/3pKrtJK), “A CEO who also serves as chair can exert excessive influence on the board and its agenda, weakening the board’s oversight of management. Separating the chair and CEO positions reduces this conflict, and an independent chair provides the clearest separation of power between the CEO and the rest of the board.” ● A 2014 report from Deloitte (https://bit.ly/3vQGqe1) concluded, “The chairman should lead the board and there should be a clear division of responsibilities between the chairman and the chief executive officer (CEO).” ● A pair of business law professors wrote
    for Harvard Business Review (https://bit.ly/3xvcIOA) in March 2020 that “letting the CEO chair the board can
    compromise board discussion quality, weakening the corporation’s risk management ability… Splitting the CEO and
    board chair jobs between two people can help strengthen the quality of questions the corporation asks itself. When these questions
    remain weak, the organization is less likely to develop strategies that mitigate risk.” ● Proxy adviser Glass Lewis advised (https://bit.ly/3xwuJwa) in 2021, “the presence of an independent chair fosters the creation of a thoughtful and dynamic board not dominated by the views of senior management. Further, we believe that the separation of these two key roles eliminates the conflict of interest that inevitably occurs when a CEO is responsible for self-oversight.” Table of Contents 112 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT THE BOARD’S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO ITEM 8 The Board of Directors has carefully considered this shareowner proposal
and recommends that shareowners vote AGAINST it. The Board Considers Its Governance Structure Annually This proposal
seeks to permanently separate the roles of Chairman of the Board and CEO and to limit the Board’s flexibility in determining who
should serve as Chairman of the Board. Our Board believes this would be unnecessarily rigid and would not serve the interests of shareowners
over time. Under our Corporate
Governance Guidelines, our Directors elect a Chairman of the Board each year. They discuss what they believe will be the most appropriate
Board leadership structure to best serve the needs of the business and our shareowners, including whether the roles of Chairman of the
Board and CEO should be combined. Our Strong Lead Independent Director Provides an Effective Balance to
a Combined Chairman and CEO and Contributes to a Robust Governance Structure for the Board The Board believes
that leadership of both the Board and the Company by Mr. Quincey is the optimal structure to guide the Company and maintain the focus
required to achieve its business goals. The Board has implemented a robust leadership structure that includes the combined Chairman and
CEO, complemented by a Lead Independent Director, plus Board committees led primarily by independent Directors. With the exception of
the Executive Committee, all of the Board committees are composed entirely of independent Directors, and all of our independent Directors
play an active role in overseeing the Company’s business. Our Lead Independent
Director has significant authority under our Corporate Governance Guidelines to lead our Board and direct topics for discussion. For
example, our Lead Independent Director, among other things, presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present,
including executive sessions; approves Board meeting agendas and adds agenda items at his or her discretion; approves Board meeting materials
for distribution to the Board; may call meetings of the independent Directors; and leads the annual evaluation of the Chairman and CEO.
Finally, the Board has designated the Lead Independent Director as the key point of contact at the Board level for shareowners and other
stakeholders. We believe these powers provide an effective balance between strong Company leadership and appropriate safeguards and oversight
by independent Directors. Mr. Quincey Offers Deep Company and Industry Experience and Simplifies
Business-to-Board Communication We believe
that having Mr. Quincey serve the combined role of Chairman and CEO provides certain synergies and efficiencies that enhance the functioning
of the Board and, importantly, allow the Board to most effectively execute its role in overseeing business strategy. The Company’s
business is complex, and its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the world, mostly by independent bottling
partners. Mr. Quincey maintains strong relationships with leaders of the Company’s bottling partners, which he has developed over
the course of his career with the Company, and he remains close to the many facets of the Company’s international business. As
the Board member most closely involved with the Company’s vast and complex business, Mr. Quincey is best able to identify the most
pressing business issues that require Board attention, and as Chairman can best focus Directors’ attention on the most critical
business matters. Further, in
the Board’s experience, the combined role of Chairman and CEO allows for timely and unfiltered communication with the Board on
critical business issues. We also believe there are benefits when the same person represents both the Company and the Board throughout
the world with bottling partners, customers, consumers and other stakeholders. Table of Contents 113 We Maintain Leading Corporate Governance Practices to Further Accountability In
addition to the independent oversight and leadership provided by our Lead Independent Director, our Board and the Company maintain leading
corporate governance practices, including: ● The full Board and each committee have authority to retain their own independent outside legal, financial, or other advisors, as the members deem necessary. ● The full Board participates in the performance evaluation of both executive leadership and of itself. ● Our shareowners have access to strong shareowner rights, including the right to request a special meeting of shareowners and proxy access (the ability to nominate director candidates and have those nominees included in our Proxy Statement). The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareowner proposal requesting an independent Board chair policy. Table of Contents 114 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Shareowner Proposal Requesting a Report on Risks from State Policies Restricting Reproductive Rights 9 As You Sow, 2020 Milvia Street, Suite 500, Berkeley,
CA 94704, as representative of Brian Patrick Kariger Rev Tr, the beneficial owner of 1,902 shares of Company Common Stock, and other
co-filers, submitted the following proposal. WHEREAS: While the
Coca-Cola Company (“Coke”) has stated “[t]here is overwhelming evidence that achieving equality and empowerment
for women has broad ripple effects that are good for society,” in the 2020-22 election cycles, the Proponent estimates that
Coke has given more than $1.8 million to politicians and political organizations seeking to limit women’s reproductive rights. 1 States have introduced nearly 600 laws restricting abortion access, 2 and 14 states have banned most abortions
at six weeks of pregnancy, including Georgia. Other states have protected abortion access. 3 This patchwork of laws
adds complexity for Coke. Coke and its independent bottling partners operate in states where reproductive rights have been limited.
Employees of Coke and its partners now face challenges accessing reproductive healthcare, including abortion services, for themselves
or family members. Employers, as well as employees,
bear the cost of restricted access to reproductive health care. For example, women who cannot access abortion are three times
more likely to leave the workforce than women who have access to abortion. 4 The Institute for Women’s Policy
Research estimates that state-level abortion restrictions may annually keep more than 500,000 women aged 15 to 44 out of the workforce. 5 Coke may find it more difficult
to recruit employees to Georgia or to the other states that have outlawed abortion. 6 According to a 2022 survey, more
than 50 percent of women under 40, regardless of political affiliation, would prefer to work for a company that supports abortion
access. 7 This may harm Coke’s ability to meet diversity and inclusion goals, with negative consequences to performance,
brand, and reputation. Surveys have consistently
shown that a majority of Americans wanted to keep the Roe v. Wade framework intact. 8 In a 2021 survey of consumers,
64 percent said employers should ensure that employees have access to reproductive health care and 42 percent would be more likely
to buy from a brand that publicly supports reproductive health care. 9 RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Coca-Cola’s
Board of Directors issue a public report prior to December 31, 2023, omitting confidential information and at reasonable expense,
detailing any known and potential risks or costs to the company caused by enacted or proposed state policies severely restricting
reproductive rights, and detailing any strategies beyond litigation and legal compliance that the company may deploy to minimize
or mitigate these risks. SUPPORTING
STATEMENT: Shareholders recommend that the report evaluate any risks and costs to the company associated with new laws and legislation
severely restricting reproductive rights and similar restrictive laws proposed or enacted in other states. In its discretion, the board’s
analysis may include effects on employee hiring, retention, and productivity, and decisions regarding closure or expansion of operations
in states proposing or enacting restrictive laws and strategies, such as any public policy advocacy by the company, related political
contribution policies, and human resources or educational strategies. 1 https://msmagazine.com/2022/07/20/dark-money-abortion-bans-corporations-business-amazon-att/ 2 https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/what-u-s-abortion-access-looks-graphics-n1274859 3 https://reproductiverights.org/maps/abortion-laws-by-state/ 4 https://www.ansirh.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/turnaway_study_brief_web.pdf. 5 https://iwpr.org/costs-of-reproductive-health-restrictions/ 6 https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PerryUndem-TX-Abortion-Law_Survey-Findings_0901.pdf 7 https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2022/08/02/employees-want-to-work-for-companies-that-support-access-to-abortion-according-to-leaninorg-study/ 8 https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/16/post-abc-poll-abortion-supreme-court/ 9 https://greenwaldresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tara-Health-Foundation-2021-Consumer-Survey-on-Brands-Defending-Reproductive-Health.pdf Table of Contents 115 THE BOARD’S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO ITEM 9 The Board of
Directors has carefully considered this shareowner proposal and recommends that shareowners vote AGAINST it. The Board believes
that the Company’s robust risk management processes that are already in place are appropriate and sufficient to address potential
risks raised in this shareowner proposal, without conducting additional analysis or reporting. In addition, the Company already has in
place comprehensive health benefits that provide for our employees’ needs, as opposed to what might be otherwise suggested in this
proposal. Shareowners
have elected the Board to oversee risk. Inherent in the Board’s responsibilities is an understanding of, and oversight over, the
various risks facing the Company. Effective risk oversight is one of the key priorities for the Board, which has implemented a risk governance
framework to minimize exposure to unforeseen events, as well as identified risks and emerging risks that may not be impacting our business
now but have the potential to do so in the future. Shareowners
are encouraged to review more information about the Board’s oversight of risk on page 30 of this Proxy Statement. Risk oversight
includes risks related to our workforce, which is a primary focus of this shareowner proposal. We know that the success of our business
depends on our ability to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Our success also relies
on our ability to nurture a culture that supports our growth and aligns employees around the Company’s purpose and work that matters
most. This proposal
suggests that our employees face challenges accessing certain benefits. The Company has in place comprehensive health benefits that provide
for our employees’ needs. The Company
takes pride in the comprehensive Total Rewards package offered to our employees. This includes benefits essential to the well-being of
women, children and families, such as reproductive and maternal health services, and family planning. The Company
has a medical travel reimbursement policy that covers a range of travel expenses. At a minimum, this travel reimbursement policy would
relate to a broad range of treatments and procedures when they are (i) medically necessary, and (ii) not available in-state. The Company
does not determine which treatments and procedures are medically necessary; rather these are the decisions of our employees’ healthcare
providers and the insurance companies administering the plan. The employee would utilize the regular claims procedures to seek coverage
under our medical travel reimbursement policy. The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareowner proposal requesting a report on risks from state policies restricting reproductive rights.

your ownership of Common Stock as of February 24, 2023. During the 2023 Annual Meeting: After accessing the
2023 Annual Meeting as a shareowner of record or beneficial owner as described in question 2 above, click on the “Q&A”
icon at the top of the screen to type in your question, then click “Send” to submit. Those who attend the 2023 Annual Meeting
as a guest will not have the option to submit questions during the meeting. We intend to answer all questions submitted that are pertinent
to the Company and the items being voted on by shareowners during the 2023 Annual Meeting as time permits and in accordance with our
meeting procedures. Questions regarding personal matters, including those related to employment, product or service issues, or suggestions
for product innovations, are not pertinent to meeting matters and therefore will not be answered. Substantially similar questions will
be answered only once due to time constraints. 4. WHAT IF I EXPERIENCE TECHNICAL
    DIFFICULTIES? The virtual meeting platform is fully supported across most
internet browsers (Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Chrome and Safari) and devices (desktops, laptops, tablets and cell phones) running the most
up-to-date version of applicable software and plug-ins. Participants should ensure that they have a sufficient internet connection wherever
they intend to participate in the meeting. Online access will open at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, 30 minutes
prior to the start of the meeting, to allow time for you to log in and test your system and internet connectivity. We encourage you to
access the meeting prior to the start time. For further assistance, you may call 1-888-724-2416 (toll free) or 1-781-575-2748 (international

    MEETING? Only shareowners of record of our Common Stock as of the close
of business on February 24, 2023, the record date, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting or at any adjournments or postponements
of the meeting. Each shareowner of record on the record date is entitled to
one vote for each share of Common Stock owned. On February 24, 2023, there were 4,326,305,541 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. Table of Contents 118 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 6. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
    OWNING SHARES AS A SHAREOWNER OF RECORD AND AS A BENEFICIAL OWNER? If your shares are registered directly in your name with the
Company’s registrar and transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered the “shareowner of record” with respect to
those shares. If your shares are held in a bank or brokerage account, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of those
shares. 7. WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE PROXY MATERIALS?
    WHAT IS A PROXY STATEMENT AND WHAT IS A PROXY? The proxy materials for our 2023 Annual Meeting include the
Notice, this Proxy Statement and our Form 10-K. If you received a paper copy of these materials, the proxy materials also include a proxy
card or voting instruction form. A proxy statement is a document that SEC regulations require
us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy is your legal designation of another
person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document,
that document also is called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated three of our officers as proxies for the 2023 Annual Meeting.
These three officers are James Quincey, John Murphy and Monica Howard Douglas. The form of proxy and this Proxy Statement have been approved
by the Board of Directors and are being provided to shareowners by the Board’s authority. 8. WHY DID I RECEIVE A “NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS” INSTEAD OF A FULL SET OF PROXY MATERIALS? We are furnishing proxy materials to our shareowners primarily
via “Notice and Access” delivery pursuant to SEC rules. On or about March 10, 2023, we mailed to our shareowners (other than
those who previously requested a printed set) a “Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials” containing instructions
on how to access the proxy materials via the Internet. Utilizing this method of proxy delivery expedites receipt of proxy materials by
our shareowners, reduces the cost of producing and mailing the full set of proxy materials, and helps us contribute to sustainable environmental
practices. If you receive a Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed
copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the Notice instructs you on how to access the proxy materials and vote over the Internet.
If you received a Notice by mail and would like to receive paper copies of our proxy materials in the mail, you may follow the instructions
in the Notice for making this request. The Notice also contains instructions on how you may request to receive an electronic copy of
our proxy materials by email. 9. WHY DID I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE
    NOTICE, PROXY CARD OR VOTING INSTRUCTION FORM? If you received more than one Notice, proxy card or voting
instruction form, you own shares registered in different names or own shares held in more than one account. To ensure that all shares
are voted, please vote each account over the Internet or by telephone, or sign and return by mail all proxy cards and voting instruction
forms. If you are a shareowner of record and would like to consolidate your accounts, please contact Computershare at (888) 265-3747
for assistance. If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should contact them directly and request consolidation. 10. WHAT SHARES ARE INCLUDED ON THE
    PROXY CARD? If you are a shareowner of record, you will receive only one
Notice or proxy card for all of the shares of Common Stock you hold in certificate form, in book-entry form and in any Company benefit
plan. If you are a Company employee and own shares of Common Stock
in The Coca-Cola Company 401(k) Plan, the Caribbean Refrescos, Inc. Thrift Plan, or any other of our U.S. 401(k) plans (collectively,
the “Plans”), it is important that you direct the trustee(s) of the Plans how to vote your shares held in such Plans. If
you do not vote your shares or specify your voting instructions on your proxy card, the trustee of the applicable Plan will vote your
shares in the same proportion as the shares for which they have received voting instructions in accordance with the trustees’ duties. To allow sufficient time for voting by the trustee(s), your voting instructions must be received by April 20, 2023. If you are a beneficial owner (other than as a participant
in a Plan set forth above), you will receive voting instruction information from the bank, broker or other nominee through which you
own your shares of Common Stock. Table of Contents 119 11. WHAT ARE MY VOTING CHOICES FOR EACH OF THE PROPOSALS TO BE VOTED ON AT THE 2023 ANNUAL MEETING AND WHAT ARE THE VOTING STANDARDS?

        each proposal, shareowners may: ● vote in favor of the shareowner proposal; ● vote against the shareowner proposal; or ● abstain from voting on the shareowner proposal. The Board recommends a vote AGAINST each of the shareowner proposals. Majority of votes cast As advisory votes, the proposals to approve executive compensation
and the frequency of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation are not binding on the Company. The Talent and Compensation
Committee will consider the outcome of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation when making future compensation decisions.
With respect to the frequency of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation, the Board will consider the outcome of the vote
when determining how often to hold the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. Although the Audit Committee has the sole authority
to appoint the Independent Auditors, as a matter of good corporate governance, the Board submits its selection of the Independent Auditors
to our shareowners for ratification. If the shareowners do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit Committee will
reconsider the appointment. 12. WHAT DIFFERENT METHODS CAN I USE
    TO VOTE? See page 1 for additional information about how to
vote. By Telephone or Internet Prior to the 2023 Annual Meeting. All shareowners of record can vote through the Internet in advance using the procedures and instructions described on the Notice
or proxy card, or by touchtone telephone within the United States, United States territories and Canada, using the toll-free telephone
number on the Notice or proxy card. Beneficial owners may vote in advance through the Internet or by telephone if their bank, broker
or other nominee makes those methods available, in which case the bank, broker or other nominee will include the instructions with the
proxy materials. The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareowners’ identities, to allow shareowners
to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been recorded properly. Table of Contents 120 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT By Written Proxy . All shareowners of record can vote
by written proxy card. If you are a shareowner of record and receive the Notice, you may request a written proxy card by following the

from your bank, broker or other nominee. Electronically During the 2023 Annual Meeting . After

and beneficial owners may vote electronically during the meeting. 13. WHAT IF I AM A SHAREOWNER OF RECORD
    AND DO NOT SPECIFY A CHOICE FOR A MATTER WHEN RETURNING A PROXY? Shareowners should specify their choice for each matter on
the proxy card. If no specific instructions are given on all matters, proxies which are signed and returned will be voted: ● FOR the election of all Director nominees
    as set forth in this Proxy Statement ● FOR the advisory vote to approve executive compensation ● ONE YEAR for the frequency of the advisory vote to approve
    executive compensation ● FOR the proposal to ratify the appointment of Ernst &
    Young LLP as Independent Auditors ● AGAINST each of the shareowner proposals 14. WHAT IF I AM A BENEFICIAL OWNER
    AND DO NOT GIVE VOTING INSTRUCTIONS TO MY BROKER? As a beneficial owner, in order to ensure your shares are
voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee by the deadline provided
in the materials you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker
or other nominee, whether your shares can be voted by such person depends on the type of item being considered for a vote. Non-Discretionary Items. The election of Directors,
the advisory vote to approve executive compensation, the advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes to approve executive
compensation and the shareowner proposals are non-discretionary items and may not be voted on by brokers, banks or other nominees who
have not received specific voting instructions from beneficial owners. Discretionary Items. The ratification of the appointment
of Ernst & Young LLP as Independent Auditors is a discretionary item. Generally, banks, brokers and other nominees that do not receive
voting instructions from beneficial owners may vote on this proposal in their discretion. 15. HOW ARE ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER
    NON-VOTES COUNTED? Abstentions and broker non-votes are included in determining
whether a quorum is present but will not be included in vote totals and will not affect the outcome of the vote. 16. WHAT CAN I DO IF I CHANGE MY MIND
    AFTER I VOTE MY SHARES? Shareowners can revoke a previously delivered proxy prior
to the completion of voting at the meeting by: ● giving written notice to the Office
    of the Secretary of the Company; ● delivering a later-dated proxy; or ● attending the meeting and voting your shares electronically
    through the online meeting platform (if you are a beneficial owner, you must follow the instructions outlined in question 2). 17. CAN I ACCESS THE PROXY MATERIALS ON THE INTERNET? HOW CAN I SIGN UP FOR THE ELECTRONIC PROXY DELIVERY SERVICE? The Notice, Proxy Statement and Form 10-K are available at www.edocumentview.com/coca-cola . In addition, shareowners are able to access these documents on the 2023 Annual Meeting page of

    THE VOTES? We will continue our long-standing practice of holding the
votes of all shareowners in confidence from Directors, officers and employees except: ● as necessary to meet applicable legal
    requirements and to assert or defend claims for or against the Company; ● in the case of a contested proxy solicitation; ● if a shareowner makes a written comment on the proxy
    card or otherwise communicates his or her vote to management; or ● to allow the independent inspectors of election to certify
    the results of the vote. We also will continue, as we have for many years, to retain
an independent tabulator to receive and tabulate the proxies and independent inspectors of election to certify the results. 19. WHEN WILL THE COMPANY ANNOUNCE
    THE VOTING RESULTS? We will announce the preliminary voting results at the 2023
Annual Meeting. The Company will report the final results on our website and in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within
four business days after the 2023 Annual Meeting. 20. DOES THE COMPANY HAVE A POLICY
    ABOUT DIRECTORS’ ATTENDANCE AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREOWNERS? The Company does not have a policy about Directors’
attendance at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners, but Directors are encouraged to attend. All Directors at the time attended the 2022
Annual Meeting of Shareowners, other than Robert A. Kotick, who did not stand for reelection at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. 21. HOW ARE PROXIES SOLICITED AND WHAT
    IS THE COST? We bear all expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation
of proxies. We have engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist with the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of $30,000
plus expenses. We will reimburse brokers, fiduciaries and custodians for their costs in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners
of Common Stock. Our Directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies
by mail, telephone and personal contact. They will not receive any additional compensation for these activities. 22. WHAT IS HOUSEHOLDING? As permitted by the 1934 Act, only one copy of the Notice
or proxy materials is being delivered to shareowners residing at the same address, unless the shareowners have notified the Company of
their desire to receive multiple copies of the Notice or proxy materials. This is known as “householding.” The Company will promptly deliver, upon oral or written request,
a separate copy of the Notice or proxy materials to any shareowner residing at an address to which only one copy was mailed. Requests
for additional copies should be directed to the Office of the Secretary as described in the response to question 28. Shareowners of record

AT THE 2024 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREOWNERS? Shareowners may present proper proposals for inclusion in

the Company in a timely manner. Proposals should be addressed to the Office of the Secretary as specified in question 28. For a shareowner
proposal other than a Director nomination to be considered for inclusion in our 2024 Proxy Statement for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareowners,
we must receive the written proposal on or before November 11, 2023. In addition, shareowner proposals must otherwise comply with the
requirements of Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the 1934 Act. Under certain circumstances, shareowners may also submit nominations
for Directors for inclusion in our proxy materials by complying with the requirements in our By-Laws. For more information regarding
proxy access, please see question 30. Our By-Laws also establish an advance notice procedure for
shareowners who wish to present a proposal, including the nomination of Directors, before an annual meeting of shareowners, but do not
intend for the proposal to be included in our proxy materials. Pursuant to our By-Laws, in order for business to be properly presented
before an annual meeting by a shareowner, the shareowner must have complied with the notice procedures specified in our By-Laws and such
business must be a proper matter for shareowner action under the Delaware General Corporation Law. To be timely for our 2024 Annual Meeting
of Shareowners, we must receive the written notice on or before December 27, 2023. In addition to satisfying the requirements under our
By-Laws, to comply with the universal proxy rules under the 1934 Act, shareowners who intend to solicit proxies in support of director
nominees other than the Company’s nominees must provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the
1934 Act, no later than February 25, 2024. Notice should be addressed to the Office of the Secretary as specified in question 28. In addition, the shareowner proponent, or a representative
who is qualified under state law, must attend the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareowners to present such proposal or nomination. 30. HOW DO I NOMINATE A DIRECTOR USING THE PROXY ACCESS
PROVISIONS OF THE COMPANY’S BY-LAWS? Our Board has adopted a “Proxy Access for Director Nominations”
by-law. The proxy access by-law permits a shareowner, or a group of up to 20 shareowners, owning 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding
Common Stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials Director nominees constituting
up to two individuals or 20% of the Board (whichever is greater), provided that the shareowner(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements
specified in Article I, Section 12 of our By-Laws. Pursuant to our By-Laws, to be timely for inclusion in the
proxy materials for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareowners, we must receive a shareowner’s notice to nominate a Director using
the Company’s proxy materials between October 12, 2023 and November 11, 2023. Such notice should be addressed to the Office of
the Secretary as specified in question 28. The notice must contain the information required by our By-Laws, and the shareowner(s) and
nominee(s) must comply with the information and other requirements in our By-Laws relating to the inclusion of shareowner nominees in
our proxy materials. Table of Contents 124 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Annex B — Summary of Plans The following section provides information on Company-sponsored
plans in which the Named Executive Officers participated in 2022. RETIREMENT PLANS – PENSION TCCC Pension Plan. The TCCC Pension Plan is a broad-based
tax-qualified defined benefit plan for substantially all U.S. employees of the Company and its participating subsidiaries. A participant’s
benefit formula in the TCCC Pension Plan is dependent on the participant’s date of hire and age. The information below summarizes
the provisions applicable to employees, including the participating Named Executive Officers. There are no special or enhanced pension
plans for the Named Executive Officers. Vesting. Pension benefits vest after completing one year of service. Benefit Formula. Prior to 2010, all pension benefits were based
on a percentage of the employee’s final average compensation (the five highest consecutive years out of the last 11) up
to the limit for each year as set by the Tax Code, multiplied by the employee’s years of credited service. Effective January
1, 2010, participants began accruing a pension benefit under a new cash balance formula (known as the Part B benefit). Participants
employed as of December 31, 2009 retained the pension benefit they accrued under the prior benefit calculation formula through
December 31, 2009 (known as the Part A benefit) and were eligible for one or more special transition benefits. As a result, beginning
in 2010 and through June 30, 2022, a participant’s benefit was potentially based on two formulas, Part A (prior benefit
calculation formula) plus Part B (new cash balance formula). Under the cash balance formula, the Company makes an annual pay credit
allocation to each active participant’s account on December 31, ranging from 3% to 8% of compensation, based on the participant’s
date of hire and age. Beginning July 1, 2022, the annual pay credit was set at 5.5%, credited monthly, with a transition
period through June 30, 2027 for participants whose annual pay credit was above 5.5% as of June 30, 2022. In addition,
effective July 1, 2022, the Company makes a monthly interest credit allocation based on the value of the participant’s
account as of the first day of such month. Prior to July 1, 2022, the interest credit was made annually. The term “compensation” for determining the pension
benefit generally includes base salary, overtime, commissions and cash incentive awards, but excludes any amounts related to stock options,
performance-based cash awards, PSUs, restricted stock or restricted stock units. It also excludes deferred compensation and any extraordinary
payments related to hiring or termination of employment. Payment of Benefits. When benefits become payable upon separation
from service, participants may choose between an annuity or a lump sum option. The TCCC Pension Plan provides for payment of a
reduced benefit prior to normal retirement age and/or the current cash balance amount, as applicable. Limitations on Benefits. In 2022, a participant could receive no
more than $245,000 annually from the TCCC Pension Plan and no compensation in excess of $305,000 for the year could be taken into
account for calculating benefits under the TCCC Pension Plan. TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan. The TCCC Supplemental
Pension Plan makes employees whole when the Tax Code limits the benefit that otherwise would accrue under the TCCC Pension Plan. The
TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan also operates to keep employees whole when they defer part of their base salary or annual incentive under
the Deferred Compensation Plan. Otherwise, electing to defer would reduce an employee’s pension benefits. Vesting. Vesting and benefits under the TCCC Supplemental Pension
Plan are calculated generally in the same manner as if the participant’s otherwise eligible compensation or full annual
benefit were able to be paid from the TCCC Pension Plan. Payment of Benefits. Benefits become payable upon separation from
service. The form of payment is dictated by the terms of the plan and the participant’s age and years of service at the
time of separation. The cash balance portion of the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan is paid as a lump sum. The traditional pension
benefit portion is paid as an annuity if the participant separates on or after the earliest retirement date (generally, age 55
with 10 years of service). Otherwise, the traditional pension benefit portion is paid as a lump sum. Mobile Plan. The Mobile Plan provides a retirement benefit
to globally mobile employees. The Mobile Plan applies the same terms to international service employees worldwide. Under the Mobile
Plan, a globally mobile employee’s account is credited with a monthly percentage of pay (“pay credit”) and a
defined rate of return (“interest credit”). The pay credit is generally 10% of pay, less any benefits provided by
local retirement plans. Both pay credits and interest credits are immediately vested. A participant will continue to receive monthly
interest credits for as long as participation in the Mobile Plan continues, even if the employee is no longer on a global assignment.
Globally mobile employees who participated in certain other plans were transitioned to the Mobile Plan as of December 31, 2011
and were eligible for a monthly “transition credit” of up to 18% of pay based on the participant’s date of hire,
age and service. Benefits accrued under such other plans were converted to an opening balance in the Mobile Plan as part of the
transition. Table of Contents 125 RETIREMENT PLANS – 401(K) AND SAVINGS PLANS 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan is a broad-based tax-qualified
defined contribution plan for most U.S. employees of the Company and its participating subsidiaries. The Company matches participant
contributions up to a maximum of 3.5% of the participant’s compensation or the amount allowable under the limits imposed under
the Tax Code, whichever is lower. The Company’s matching contribution is initially invested in Common Stock, but participants may
move the contribution to any other available investment option. Employees are immediately 100% vested in Company matching contributions.
For 2022, compensation over $305,000 could not be taken into account under the 401(k) Plan. Supplemental 401(k) Plan. The Supplemental 401(k) Plan
makes employees whole when the Tax Code limits the Company matching contributions that otherwise would be credited to them under the
401(k) Plan. The Supplemental 401(k) Plan also operates to keep employees whole when they defer part of their base salary or annual incentive
under the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company credits the employee with the Company matching contributions in hypothetical share
units of Common Stock. The value of the accumulated share units, including dividend equivalents, is paid in cash after separation from
service. Participants are immediately vested in their contributions. Employees are not permitted to make contributions to the Supplemental
401(k) Plan. Spanish Savings Plan. The Spanish Savings Plan consists
of a general plan and supplementary plans which are broad-based defined contribution plans that complement social security coverage provided
in Spain for eligible employees. In the general plan, employees contribute according to their pensionable salary, in fixed percentages
according to applicable legislation. The Company triples the employee’s contribution to the general plan. Participation in the
supplementary plans is optional and being active in the general plan is a requirement to contribute. Employees can choose to contribute
to the supplementary plans from 1% to a maximum of 5% of their pensionable salary. The Company matches contributions to supplementary
plans into an early retirement insurance policy. Vesting of these contributions occurs upon fulfillment of applicable social security
early retirement rules, while still employed with the Company. Generally, under the Spanish Savings Plan, normal retirement age is 65
and benefits may not be drawn before age 60. UK Savings Plan. The UK Savings Plan is a broad-based
registered defined contribution plan in which the majority of employees in the UK participate. Effective April 2019, participants must
contribute 4% of pensionable salary and the Company contributes 10% of pensionable salary. There are no limits to the amount of contributions
that employees can make to their pension account; however, tax effectiveness of contributions is limited by both an annual allowance
and a lifetime allowance. These amounts have changed frequently over recent years and continue to be subject to change. For the 2022/2023
tax year, the annual allowance was £40,000 and the lifetime allowance was £1,073,100. Generally, under the plan, normal retirement
age is 65 and benefits may not be drawn before age 55. INCENTIVE PLANS Annual Incentive Plan. The Company maintains the Annual
Incentive Plan for employees above a specified job level. The Annual Incentive Plan provides an annual cash payment based on predefined
performance measures. The Talent and Compensation Committee may designate one or more performance measures from the list contained in
the plan. Annual incentive ranges are established for each participant. Payments are generally made in March in the year following the
applicable performance year. No participant may receive an annual payment greater than $10 million. See page 58 for additional
information about the Annual Incentive Plan. Long-Term Incentive Plans. The Company maintains long-term
incentive plans for employees above a specified job level. The following types of awards may be granted under the plans, as designated
by the Talent and Compensation Committee: (i) stock options; (ii) PSUs; (iii) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (iv) other
performance-based awards, payable in cash or Common Stock; (v) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”); and (vi) other stock-based
awards. The Company currently has outstanding awards of stock options, PSUs, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance-based
cash awards, which are described below. See page 60 for additional information about long-term incentive compensation. Stock Options. Stock options give the holder the right to purchase
shares of Common Stock at a specified price during specified time periods. The exercise price of an option may not be less than
the fair market value of Common Stock on the grant date. The fair market value is the average of the high and low prices of a
share of Common Stock on the grant date. In certain foreign jurisdictions, the law requires additional
restrictions on the calculation of the option price. The grants provide that stock options generally may not be exercised during the
first 12 months after the grant date. Generally, options vest 25% on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date
and have a term of ten years. The Company’s current compensation programs include stock options as part of the annual long-term
compensation awards made to eligible employees. Table of Contents 126 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT Performance Share Units. PSUs provide an opportunity for employees
to receive Common Stock if predefined performance measures are met for a predefined performance period. The Company’s current
compensation programs include PSUs as part of the annual long-term compensation awards made to eligible employees. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards
may be performance-based or time-based. Shares of stock are granted and transferred into the employee’s name. Shares remain
subject to forfeiture until the shares are released under the terms of the awards. Restricted stock unit awards may be performance-based
or time-based and are settled in stock when all required criteria are met. Employees do not receive any dividend equivalents on
restricted stock units during the term. The Company’s current compensation programs include restricted stock units as part
of the annual long-term compensation awards made to eligible employees. Performance Cash Awards. Performance cash awards are used in countries
where it is difficult to grant equity. Employees who receive performance cash awards do not receive equity awards as part of the
long-term incentive program. No Named Executive Officer received a performance cash award. Other Awards. While the 2014 Equity Plan provides the Talent and
Compensation Committee discretion to grant different types of equity awards, including SARs and other stock-based awards such
as unrestricted shares, no such awards have been or are expected to be granted to Named Executive Officers. OTHER PLANS Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation
Plan is a nonqualified and unfunded deferred compensation program offered to approximately 350 U.S.-based Company employees in 2022.
International service employees do not participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Eligible participants may defer up to 80% of their
base salary and up to 95% of their annual incentive. The Company has the benefit of full unrestricted use of all amounts deferred under
the Deferred Compensation Plan until such amounts are required to be distributed to the plan participants. Gains and losses are credited
based on the participant’s election of a variety of deemed investment choices. The Company does not match any employee deferral
or guarantee a return. Participants’ accounts may or may not appreciate and may depreciate depending on the performance of their
deemed investment choices. None of the deemed investment choices provide returns at above-market or preferential rates. All deferrals
are paid out in cash upon distribution. Participants may schedule a distribution during employment or may opt to receive their balance
after separation from service. Participants who are considered “specified employees” under Section 409A of the Tax Code (generally,
the top 50 highest paid executives) may not receive a post-termination distribution for at least six months following separation. On
occasion, the Company may provide a one-time credit to the Deferred Compensation Plan to make up for benefits lost under various circumstances,
such as benefits lost at a prior employer. The Company has not provided any such credits for any of the Named Executive Officers. International Service Programs. International service
program benefits generally include relocation expenses, a housing allowance (including certain housing expenses), a cost-of-living adjustment
(a cash adjustment designed to provide equivalent purchasing power), certain cash allowances recognizing differences in living conditions
in the host location, a home leave allowance and currency protection. The programs also provide tax preparation services and tax equalization,
where applicable. There were approximately 375 participants in these programs in 2022. TCCC Severance Plan. The TCCC Severance Plan provides
cash severance benefits to eligible employees who are involuntarily terminated. Eligible employees include regular, non-union U.S. employees
and global mobility employees. Generally, benefits are payable when an employee is terminated involuntarily due to certain circumstances
such as an internal reorganization or position elimination. Benefits are not payable if the employee is offered a comparable position
with the Company or one of its affiliates, is terminated for cause or has entered into a separate agreement. The benefit payable is determined
based on job level, salary and/or length of service. The minimum benefit is eight weeks of base pay and the maximum benefit is two years
of base pay. Table of Contents 127 Annex C — Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial
Measures The Company reports its financial results in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP” or referred to herein as “reported”). However,
management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that
should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures
in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance. Non-GAAP financial
measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance
with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. For additional details regarding the reconciliations of GAAP
and non-GAAP financial measures below, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2023. This
information is also available on the Company’s website, www.coca-colacompany.com by clicking on “Investors,”
