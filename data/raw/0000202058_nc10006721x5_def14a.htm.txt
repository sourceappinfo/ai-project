Brown Chairman & CEO On behalf of your Board of Directors, I am pleased to invite you to attend the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. to be held on Friday, April 24, 2020. The
                holding of the 2020 Annual Meeting approximately six months after the 2019 Annual Meeting reflects our transition to a calendar year oriented financial reporting cycle in connection with the transformational merger that created L3Harris —
                we changed our fiscal year end from the Friday nearest June 30 to the Friday nearest December 31. As a result, much of the information in the accompanying Proxy Statement, particularly relating to executive compensation matters, relates to
                the abbreviated six-month transition period of June 29, 2019 through January 3, 2020 (to which we sometimes refer to as our “fiscal transition period”). The accompanying Notice of 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement describe the matters to be acted on at the meeting, which include: > election of the 12 nominees for
                      director named in the accompanying Proxy Statement for a one-year term expiring at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders; > approval, in an advisory vote, of

                      Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the “anti-greenmail” provision; > an amendment to our Restated
                      Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the cumulative voting provision that applies when we have a 40% shareholder; > consideration of a shareholder
                      proposal as described in the accompanying Proxy Statement, if such proposal is properly presented at the meeting; and > such other business as may
                      properly come before the meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal and FOR all of the other proposals set forth above. It is important that your shares be represented and voted at the meeting, even if you are unable to attend. You can ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the meeting by
                submitting your proxy/voting instruction over the Internet or by telephone, or by mail by using the traditional proxy/voting instruction if you received your proxy materials by mail. You can find instructions for these convenient ways to

Not only do they represent a diverse mix of backgrounds, skills and experience and a track record of driving long-term shareholder value, but, together, they also possess a deep and unique
      understanding of our business and the challenges and opportunities L3Harris faces. Tenure of Director Nominees (including tenure with L3 or Harris board of directors, as applicable) As shown below, our nominees represent a favorable balance of shorter and longer tenures. At the same time, our Board’s reconstitution in connection with the Merger benefited all nominees through

                      led by Lead Independent Director. > Our Board and all standing committees conduct annual
                      self-evaluations for continuous improvement in performance and effectiveness. > Our Board membership criteria take into account diversity of viewpoints, background, experience, gender, race, ethnicity and similar demographics, as
                  well as avoiding potential overboarding (more than 4 other public company boards, under our guidelines). > Policy requiring directors to retire at age 75 (exception for three years for directors designated pursuant to Merger-related provisions of our governing documents). > Board reviews and evaluates management development and
                      succession plans. > Strong ethics and business conduct program , reflecting our commitment to our Code of Conduct and broader compliance principles, to responsible corporate citizenship and sustainability and to our belief that we should conduct all business dealings with honesty, integrity and responsibility . L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 3 Table of Contents PROXY SUMMARY PERFORMANCE
                    HIGHLIGHTS SHAREHOLDER INPUT AND ALIGNMENT > Meaningful stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors. > Prohibition on short sales, hedging, other derivative transactions and pledging of our common stock by directors and executive officers. > Robust proxy access By-Law provision allowing eligible shareholders to nominate and include in our proxy materials candidates for election to our Board. > Shareholders holding at least 25% of our common stock can call a special meeting. > Annual “say-on-pay” advisory vote. > Engagement with large share holders on key aspects of our executive compensation program. PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS Key 6-Month Fiscal Transition Period Financial Results Revenue, adjusted EBIT and adjusted free cash flow results are important because they are components of performance measures used in incentive compensation. * See Appendix A for reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. “EPS” refers to income from continuing operations per diluted common share. The holding of the 2020 Annual Meeting approximately six months after the 2019 Annual Meeting reflects our transition to a calendar year oriented financial reporting cycle in connection with the
                  transformational merger that created L3Harris — we changed our fiscal year end from the Friday nearest June 30 to the Friday nearest December 31. As a result, much of the information in this proxy statement, particularly relating to
                  executive compensation matters, relates to the abbreviated six-month transition period of June 29, 2019 through January 3, 2020 (which we sometimes refer to as our “fiscal transition period”). 4 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents PROXY SUMMARY EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS Strategic Achievements Our strong fiscal transition period financial results reflected our successful execution of the key strategic priorities L3Harris set for our fiscal transition period, which were: > Executing seamless integration of L3 and Harris, including achieving at least $500 million in gross cost synergies from the Merger by the end of 2021; > Driving flawless execution and margin expansion through our e3 (excellence everywhere every day) operational excellence program; > Building a new performance culture with a strong bias for action and accountability; > Growing revenue through investments in differentiated technology and innovation; > Reshaping our portfolio to focus on high margin, high growth businesses; and > Maximizing cash flow with shareholder friendly capital deployment. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS Our basic executive compensation philosophy is as follows: OVERALL OBJECTIVE Encourage and reward creation of sustainable, long-term shareholder value GUIDING PRINCIPLES > Align with shareholders’ interests > Be competitive at target
                    performance level > Motivate achievement of financial
                      goals and strategic objectives > Align realized pay with
                      performance Target Pay Mix for 6-Month Fiscal Transition Period Consistent with our goals of aligning pay with performance and with the interests of our shareholders, a high percentage of fiscal transition period total target
        direct compensation is at risk (either performance-based or time-based) . Under our incentive plans, compensation may be at risk either because it is performance-based (payouts depend on achievement relative to pre-established performance
      goals) or time-based (equity awards subject to delayed vesting and thus the risk of a potential decrease in the price of our common stock). For the calculations below, total target direct compensation for our 6-month fiscal transition period includes 50% of annual base salary level, the target value of annual cash incentive awards
      (which were granted at 50% of full-year values) and the target value of annual cycle awards of long-term equity-based incentive compensation (also granted at 50% of full-year values); but does not include the target value of the special, one-time
      integration-related long-term equity-based incentive compensation awards (which are entirely performance-based and at risk) or other compensation elements such as retirement, severance, health, welfare or other personal benefits; transition or
      relocation benefits; or payouts that occurred in our fiscal transition period as a result of the Merger. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 5 Table of Contents PROXY SUMMARY EXECUTIVE

                    value, as well as a deep and unique understanding of our business and the challenges and opportunities L3Harris faces, our Board is well positioned to discharge its responsibilities. > Nominees collectively have broad and diverse leadership experience and many other qualifications, skills and attributes that our Board views
                      as valuable to L3Harris. > Favorable balance of shorter and longer tenures among nominees, all of whom are independent, except Mr. Brown, our Chairman and CEO, and Mr.
                      Kubasik, our Vice Chairman, President and COO. Our entire Board is elected annually by our shareholders. Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that our Board shall consist of not less than 8 or more than 13 directors, the exact
      number of directors to be determined from time to time by our Board. Each director holds office until the Annual Meeting of Shareholders for the year in which that director’s term expires, and until that director’s successor is elected and qualified,
      except in the case of death, resignation, retirement or removal from office. Vacancies may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors. OUR NOMINEES AS A GROUP Our Board currently consists of the following twelve directors: > William M. Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; > Christopher E. Kubasik, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer; and > Ten independent directors (Sallie B. Bailey, Peter W. Chiarelli, Thomas A. Corcoran, Thomas A. Dattilo, Roger B. Fradin, Lewis Hay III, Lewis Kramer, Rita S. Lane,
                        Robert B. Millard and Lloyd W. Newton). Based on the recommendation of our Nominating and Governance Committee, our Board has nominated the 12 directors comprising our Board – all of whom are standing for election as incumbents – for a
      new one-year term that will expire at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. No nominee is related to any other nominee or to any executive officer of L3Harris or its subsidiaries, by blood, marriage or adoption. Below we provide information on each nominee’s experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that our Board has determined support the nominee’s nomination and service as a L3Harris director.
      Data with respect to the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by each of our directors as of February 3, 2020 can be found in the table on page 98. Beginning on page 16, we describe our director nomination process and the criteria
      we apply in selecting nominees. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 7 Table of Contents PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS VOTING STANDARD FOR DIRECTORS VOTING STANDARD FOR DIRECTORS Under our By-Laws and Corporate Governance Guidelines, the voting standard for the election of our directors is a majority voting standard in uncontested elections and a plurality voting standard
      in contested elections. The election of directors at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is an uncontested election and thus the majority voting standard applies. To be elected under a majority voting standard, a director nominee must receive more “For” votes than “Against” votes. Abstentions and any broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of
      directors because only votes cast “For” or “Against” a nominee will be counted. Any incumbent director nominee who does not receive more “For” votes than “Against” votes must promptly offer to tender his or her resignation following certification of
      the vote, and our Nominating and Governance Committee will then recommend to our Board whether or not to accept it. Our Board shall take action within 90 days following certification of the vote, unless such action would cause us to fail to comply
      with the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) independence or other legal requirements, in which event our Board shall take action as promptly as practicable while continuing to meet such requirements. Our Board will also promptly publicly disclose its
      decision and the reasons therefor. If our Board does not accept the resignation, the nominee will continue to serve as a director until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until his or her successor shall be duly elected and qualified, or
      until his or her prior death, resignation, retirement or removal from office. If our Board accepts the resignation, then a majority of our Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy or may choose not to fill the vacancy and to
      decrease the size of our Board. Proxies will be voted for the election of each of Ms. Bailey, Ms. Lane and Messrs. Brown, Chiarelli, Corcoran, Dattilo, Fradin, Hay, Kramer, Kubasik, Millard and Newton to
      serve for a one-year term expiring at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, unless otherwise specified in the proxy/voting instructions. Proxies cannot be voted for more than the 12 nominees for director named in this proxy statement. CRITERIA FOR BOARD MEMBERSHIP General Criteria Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board selects director nominees based on the recommendation of our Nominating and Governance Committee and the following criteria: > Demonstrated ability and sound judgment; > Personal qualities and characteristics, accomplishments and reputation in the business community, professional integrity, educational background, business experience
                          and related experience; > Willingness to objectively appraise management performance; > Current knowledge and contacts in the markets in which we do business and in our industry or other relevant industries, giving due consideration

                    Chairman. > Each current director also is requested to discuss any concerns or issues regarding continued membership on our Board with the Chairperson of our Nominating and Governance
                    Committee. > In addition, our Nominating and Governance Committee reviews each current director’s experience, qualifications, attributes, skills, tenure, contributions, other
                    directorships, meeting attendance record, any changes in employment status and other information it deems helpful in considering and evaluating the director for nomination. Our Nominating and Governance Committee followed this process with respect to nominees for election at the 2020 Annual Meeting. Consideration of Diversity Our Board values diversity as a factor in selecting nominees to serve on our Board. Although we have adopted no specific policy on diversity, our Nominating and Governance Committee considers our
      Board membership criteria in selecting nominees for directors, including diversity of viewpoints, background, experience, gender, race, ethnicity and similar demographics. Such considerations also may include personal characteristics, functional
      background, executive or professional experience, and international experience. As a general matter, our Board considers diversity in the context of our Board as a whole and takes into account the personal characteristics and experience of current
      and prospective directors to facilitate Board deliberations and decisions that reflect a broad range of perspectives. NOMINEE BIOGRAPHIES Each of the nominees has consented to stand for election. If any nominee becomes unavailable for election, which we do not currently anticipate, proxies instructing a vote for that nominee may be
      voted for a substitute nominee selected by our Board or, alternatively, our Board may determine to leave the vacancy temporarily unfilled or reduce the number of directors in accordance with our By-Laws.

(2012 - June 28, 2019) > Torchmark Corporation (2006 - 2018) DIRECTOR NOMINATION PROCESS Our Board is responsible for approving nominees to stand for election as directors. Our Nominating and Governance Committee assists in this process, identifying individuals it
      determines are qualified to become Board members and recommending nominees. Our Board has a long-standing policy to consider director nominees recommended by shareholders. A shareholder who wishes to recommend a nominee may do so by following the process discussed on page
      100. Our Secretary will forward properly submitted shareholder-recommended nominations to the Chairperson of our Nominating and Governance Committee, and such nominations will be evaluated and considered by that committee in the same manner in which
      it evaluates other proposed nominees. In addition, the “proxy access” provision of our By-Laws allows an individual eligible shareholder, or a group of no more than 20 eligible shareholders, to nominate and include in our proxy
      materials candidates for election to our Board under terms that include the following: > The shareholder or shareholder group must have owned 3% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock continuously for at least three years. > The maximum number of proxy access nominees permitted is the greater of two or 20% of our Board (rounded down to the nearest whole number). > The shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) must satisfy additional eligibility and procedural requirements set forth in Article II, Section 11 of our By-Laws, including that a proxy access nomination
                  notice must be delivered to us within a prescribed time period in advance of our Annual Meeting of Shareholders (see page 100 for the specific timeframe that applies to nominations for our 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders) and that all
                  nominees and nominating shareholder(s) provide certain information, representations and agreements to us. Our Board believes that the proxy access provision of our By-Laws strikes an appropriate balance between providing our shareholders with broad and meaningful access to our proxy materials, on one
      hand, and requiring sufficient transparency, protecting the interests of all shareholders and ensuring effective governance, on the other hand, and reflects best practices by being broadly consistent with other Standard & Poor’s 500 (“S&P
      500”) companies’ proxy access by-laws. Our Nominating and Governance and Committee expects to retain a third-party search firm to assist in identifying and/or evaluating potential nominees, and all of our current
      independent directors who were previously directors of Harris were identified and/or evaluated using that process. 16 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS BOARD REFRESHMENT POLICY BOARD REFRESHMENT POLICY As noted above, upon completion of the Merger on June 29, 2019, our Board was reconstituted to consist of twelve directors: > William M. Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (formerly Harris’ Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer); > Christopher E. Kubasik, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer (formerly L3’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President); > Five independent directors from the Harris Board (Sallie B. Bailey, Peter W. Chiarelli, Thomas A. Dattilo, Roger B. Fradin and Lewis Hay III);
                    and > Five independent directors from the L3 Board (Thomas A. Corcoran, Lewis Kramer, Rita S. Lane, Robert B. Millard and Lloyd W. Newton). Our Board believes that these twelve directors not only have a diverse mix of backgrounds, skills and experience and a track record of driving long-term shareholder value, but, together, also
      possess a deep and unique understanding of our business and thus the challenges and opportunities L3Harris faces, and therefore, our Board is well positioned to discharge its responsibilities. Our Board has a favorable balance of shorter and longer
      tenures and has benefited through new interactions and the accompanying refreshed perspectives. We do not impose term limits for directors. Under our retirement policy, a director who reaches age 75 may not be appointed, re-appointed, nominated or stand for election or re-election, but may
      serve out the remainder of his or her then-current term. This policy does not apply to any director designated pursuant to the Merger-related provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our By-Laws, until after the third anniversary
      of the Merger. A director also is expected to offer to tender his or her resignation from the Board in the event of retirement from his or her principal position or another significant change in employment position or employer. Our Board then would
      determine whether such director’s continued Board membership under the new circumstances is in the best interests of L3Harris and our shareholders, free from conflicts of interest and otherwise appropriate.

As part of our annual strategic planning process, toward the end of each fiscal
      year, our senior leadership team and other executives present to our Board Company-wide and business unit annual operating plans and three-year strategic plans for the upcoming fiscal year(s). Our Board thoroughly reviews and provides substantive
      insight and guidance on these plans and, after further review sessions, approves them. Our Board then receives regular updates throughout the year on the progress, challenges and risks with respect to execution of the plans. Our Board also routinely receives updates on and discusses topics of strategic importance to us, such as technology, cybersecurity, enterprise risk management and merger, acquisition and portfolio
      shaping opportunities. Our Board holds executive sessions solely for independent directors, and separately with our CEO and COO present, at each regularly-scheduled Board meeting to discuss strategic matters and other significant business
      developments. Risk Oversight In fulfilling its responsibility of overseeing the management of our business and other enterprise risks, our Board has approved our use of an enterprise risk management (“ERM”) process
      administered by management, as described below, and considers risks and related mitigation identified through the ERM process or raised in the context of a range of matters on which management reports to our Board or one of its committees. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Our ERM process, among other things, is designed to identify material risks across L3Harris with input from each business segment and function. This process has been reviewed by our Board and is
      the subject of oversight and regular review by our Audit Committee. However, the responsibility for the day-to-day management of risk lies with our management, which continually monitors the material risks facing L3Harris, including strategic risk,
      financial risk, operational risk, and legal and compliance risk. Under our ERM process, which is coordinated through a cross-functional management committee, various material business risks are regularly identified, assessed and prioritized. The top
      risks to L3Harris, which are reflected in an enterprise risk “heat map,” and any mitigation plans associated with those risks, are reported to our Board. In addition, our management ERM committee regularly provides reports to our senior executives to
      ensure dissemination of information about identified risks to management and throughout L3Harris. We also manage risk through numerous controls and processes embedded in our operations, which are reviewed from time to time with our Board and/or its
      relevant committees. ALLOCATION OF RISK OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES As noted above, our Board also considers risks that are raised in the context of various matters that management may bring to the attention of our Board or one of its committees.
      When a committee considers risks, it provides reports regarding such risks to our full Board. Examples of risks considered by our Board and its committees are shown below: > Full Board – elements of risk related to Company-wide and business unit annual
                    operating plans, three-year strategic plans, cybersecurity, merger, acquisition and portfolio shaping opportunities, market environment updates, regular financial and operations updates and other strategic discussions. > Audit Committee – elements of risk related to financial reporting, internal
                    audit, internal control over financial reporting, auditor independence and related areas of accounting, taxation, law and regulation. > Compensation Committee – elements of risk related to compensation policies and
                    practices and talent management and succession planning. > Finance Committee – elements of risk related to liquidity, financial
                    arrangements, capital structure, ability to access capital markets and the financial and investment aspects of our defined contribution and defined benefit plans. > Nominating and Governance Committee – elements of risk related to corporate
                    governance issues and various aspects of U.S. and international regulatory compliance, ethics, business conduct, social responsibility, environmental, health and safety matters and export/import controls. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 19 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OUR
                    BOARD'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES Management Succession Planning As part of its oversight responsibility for management succession planning, our Board dedicates at least one meeting each year to a comprehensive review of our management
      succession strategy and our leadership pipeline for key roles, including the CEO, based on our long-term strategy. Our Board’s Compensation Committee facilitates the review session, which includes: > consideration and assessment of key leadership talent throughout our Company; > our talent strategy for critical positions, including roles for which it may be necessary to consider external candidates; and > contingency plans in the event the CEO or another executive officer unexpectedly is unable to serve for any reason, including death or
                    disability. In addition, management conducts periodic talent reviews of all of our business segments and corporate functional areas, including discussion of the succession plans for key positions and
      identification of top talent for development in future leadership roles. These reviews inform and support our Board’s review session. Our Board also receives regular updates on key talent indicators for our overall workforce, including employee
      engagement, attrition, diversity and inclusion, recruiting and development programs and our broader human capital strategy, and has regular opportunities to observe key leaders and high-potential talent through presentations, meetings and other
      events. On occasion, individual Board members may serve in a mentoring capacity for one or more of our executives. Ethics, Compliance and Sustainability Oversight Our Board has responsibility for overseeing our ethics and compliance programs and our activities related to corporate citizenship and responsibility and sustainability. This oversight is carried
      out largely through our Board’s Nominating and Governance Committee, which assists our Board in overseeing our ethics and business conduct program, our environmental, health and safety programs and our charitable, civic, educational and philanthropic
      activities, and also monitors and takes appropriate action regarding strategic issues and trends relating to environmental, social and governance efforts and corporate citizenship and responsibility that could affect our operations, financial
      performance or public image. For additional details on the role of our Nominating and Governance Committee, see page 28. CODE OF CONDUCT All L3Harris employees, officers and directors are required to abide by our Code of Conduct to help ensure that we consistently conduct our business in an ethical and legal manner. Our Code of
      Conduct is an important component of a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that includes compliance with all laws and corporate policies and procedures, an open relationship among employees that contributes to good business conduct, and an
      abiding belief that we should conduct all business dealings with integrity, honesty and responsibility. Our Nominating and Governance Committee assists our Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility as to our compliance with the goals and objectives in our Code of Conduct by reviewing and
      taking action regarding compliance processes, standards and controls and reviewing results of relevant audits and investigations. Our Code of Conduct covers a broad range of topics, including: > Respect in the workplace > Health and safety > Privacy of personally identifiable information > Avoiding conflicts of interest > Working with governments > Commitment to quality > Preventing bribery and corruption > Business courtesies > Fair competition > Exports, imports and trade compliance > Confidential information and intellectual property > Material non-public information and insider trading > Communicating L3Harris information > Social media > Business records and record management > Protecting L3Harris and customer assets > Political activities and lobbying > Human rights > Corporate responsibility Employees are required to report any conduct they believe in good faith to be a violation of our Code of Conduct or policies.

Any amendment to, or waiver from, our Code of Conduct that is required to be disclosed to
      shareholders will be posted on our website within four business days following such amendment or waiver. 20 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OUR BOARD'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES SUSTAINABILITY – ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”) As an aerospace and defense company, L3Harris leads, manages and monitors a broad range of ESG impacts, and the following summary focuses on key impacts relevant to our
            business and to our stakeholders. Sound Governance, Board Leadership. L3Harris is committed to responsible and effective corporate governance to enhance the creation of sustainable, long-term shareholder value and be accountable and responsive to all stakeholders. In support of those goals, we have Corporate Governance Guidelines that our Board regularly reviews and updates as regulatory requirements change and governance practices evolve. Our Board is well positioned to discharge its responsibilities. The members have a diverse mix of backgrounds, skills and experience and a track record of driving long-term shareholder value.
            They also have a deep and unique understanding of the business and the challenges and opportunities L3Harris faces. Living Our
              Values. Our unwavering commitment to the highest ethical standards is a cornerstone of our values and our continued success. We instill the highest standards of performance and behavior in our employees, who sign an annual pledge to
            never compromise our values in order to achieve business objectives. Our customers, shareholders, suppliers and communities expect nothing less. Advancing Environmental
              Sustainability & Compliance. The Company’s robust environmental, health and safety (“EH&S”) management system provides the framework for establishing policies and standards, as well as enterprise initiatives to reduce solid
            waste, water usage and greenhouse gas emissions. The EHS management system follows the guidelines and principles outlined in ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ANSI Z10. Following the Merger, L3Harris is working to re-baseline Company metrics and re-announce our long-term goals with the Company’s first ESG Report that will be in accordance with industry
            standards. We are focused on continuous improvement in order to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water usage and increase our solid waste diversion rate from landfill. Strategies to drive continuous improvement include leveraging our EHS management system, IDENTIFYING AND QUANTIFYING ENERGY-SAVING OPPORTUNIES,
              INSTALLING MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE, CONDUCTING solid waste characterization assessments, and establishing employee-led GreenTeams across the organization. Ensuring a Safe Workplace. L3Harris is committed to protecting the health and safety of our workers and customers and the environments in the global communities where we operate. By leveraging our EHS management system centered around industry best practices and
            continuous improvement, we minimize and seek to eliminate exposure to hazards every day to promote an ‘Accept Only Zero’ mindset. Building a High-Performance
              Culture: Diversity and Inclusion. Our commitment to speed, innovation and flawless execution is matched only by our dedication to providing every employee with rewarding career opportunities and an inclusive environment. L3Harris is proud to have eight Employee Resource Groups. These voluntary, employee-led groups connect those with shared values and interests, and host activities focused
            on professional development, community outreach and employee engagement.

            advance understanding and drive accountability. Our efforts to create a welcoming, engaging and inclusive workplace have been externally recognized. L3Harris received 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index. In addition,
            L3Harris was the only aerospace and defense company included on the 2020 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. Last year, L3Harris was also certified as a Great Place to Work. Supporting Our Communities. Community investment and outreach is more than a business strategy – it’s about driving positive change in the areas that matter most. L3Harris provides philanthropic support to our communities through
            strategic investments in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) programs that strengthen education and skills of our industry’s next generation, projects aligned with our customers’ missions and opportunities in the community.

                          OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS Communicating With Our Board of Directors GENERAL COMMUNICATIONS Shareholders and other persons who wish to communicate with a member or members of our Board, including our Chairman, our Vice Chairman, our Lead Independent Director, the chairperson of any
            standing committee of our Board or the independent directors as a group, may send an e-mail to the intended recipient(s) c/o our Secretary at corporate.secretary@l3harris.com or may write to the intended recipient(s) c/o our Secretary, L3Harris
            Technologies, Inc., 1025 West NASA Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32919. Our Secretary will review each such communication and, if it is related to the duties and responsibilities of our Board and its committees, will forward it to the
            appropriate recipient(s). A director who receives a communication for which he or she was the intended recipient will determine whether it will be sent to our full Board or a committee thereof. Our Board has instructed our Secretary not to forward communications that our Secretary deems unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or otherwise inappropriate (such as surveys, spam, junk mail,
            resumes, service or product inquiries or complaints, solicitations or advertisements). Our Secretary will periodically provide our Board a summary of all communications (other than surveys, spam, etc.) that were not forwarded to the intended
            recipient(s) and will make those communications available to any director upon request. ACCOUNTING, INTERNAL CONTROL, AUDITING AND OTHER MATTERS Our Audit Committee has established procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints and concerns regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
              matters, financial reporting or disclosure matters, and other matters relating to actual, alleged or potential violations of any law, rule or regulation relating to securities or to fraud against shareholders. Upon receipt of a complaint or
              concern, a determination will be made whether it pertains to any of these matters, and if it does, it will be handled in accordance with these procedures. A copy of the procedures is available on the Corporate Governance section of our
              website at www.l3harris.com/corporate-governance . Employees may communicate concerns about such matters to their supervisor, manager or ethics advisor, or to the Vice President, Internal Audit or the Director, Ethics and Compliance or certain
            other individuals. Alternatively, they may communicate their concerns on a confidential, anonymous basis by way of e-mail or toll-free hotline numbers listed on our website and in our Code of Conduct. Other persons with such complaints or concerns may contact our Vice President, Internal Audit or Director, Ethics and Compliance at 1025 West NASA Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32919. STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS To further align the interests of our non-employee directors and shareholders, our Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors, as follows: > Our non-employee directors are expected to own L3Harris stock or stock equivalent units having a minimum value equal to five times the annual cash retainer for service as a member of our
                        Board. > Directors are expected to meet these levels within five years after election or appointment to our Board (or five years from the closing of the Merger, in the case of non-employee directors
                        designated by Harris or L3 in connection with the Merger). Shares owned outright or jointly by the non-employee director and deferred equity awards (on an after-tax basis) credited for the non-employee director under any deferred compensation plan
            maintained by L3Harris count toward the guidelines. Directors who are retiring and will not be standing for re-election at the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders are no longer subject to the guidelines. As of February 28, 2020, all of our
            non-employee directors met the stock ownership guidelines or were on track to achieve such ownership within the applicable compliance timeframe. BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE Our Board’s leadership is currently structured as follows: > a combined position of Chairman of the Board (“Chairman”) and CEO; 22 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE > a Vice Chairman of the Board (“Vice Chairman”); > a Lead Independent Director with well-defined duties that support our Board’s oversight responsibilities; > a robust committee structure comprised solely of independent directors; and > engaged Board members who are independent (other than our current Chairman and CEO and our current Vice Chairman, President and COO) and who conduct candid and constructive discussions and
                        deliberations. Board Policy on Chairman and CEO Roles Our Board elects a Chairman from among the directors and also may appoint a Vice Chairman, as it has done in connection with the Merger. Our Board combines or separates the positions of Chairman and CEO based
            on what our Board believes best serves the needs of L3Harris and our shareholders at any particular time based on then-existing facts and circumstances. For example, in connection with the transition to Mr. Brown as Harris’ CEO in November
            2011, the Harris Board appointed Mr. Dattilo as non-executive Chairman to provide independent leadership during the transition and enable Mr. Brown to concentrate on our business operation. A few years later, the Harris Board re-combined the
            CEO and Chairman positions and designated Mr. Dattilo as Lead Independent Director. This history evidences our Board’s proactive commitment to strong corporate governance and appropriate independent oversight of management. Our Board believes it would be fundamentally wrong, however, to
            permanently and inflexibly separate or combine the positions of Chairman and CEO and remove our Board’s ability to choose the leadership structure that best serves the needs of L3Harris and our shareholders at a given time based on its unique
            knowledge of the challenges and opportunities L3Harris faces. Current Board Leadership Our Board believes the following factors are key to providing it with appropriate opportunities for oversight, discussion and evaluation of L3Harris’ decisions and direction: > the Lead Independent Director structure; > the independence of each director, other than Messrs. Brown and Kubasik; > the ability of independent directors to participate in the agenda-setting process for our Board and committee meetings; > regularly scheduled executive sessions of independent directors; and > our directors’ access to management. Our Lead Independent Director currently is Mr. Millard, whom our Board designated on June 29, 2019 and who succeeds Mr. Hay. As noted elsewhere, under the terms of the Merger Agreement and the related employment agreements with Mr. Brown and Mr. Kubasik: > Mr. Brown will serve as our Chairman and CEO through the second anniversary of the Merger, then step down as CEO and continue to serve for one additional year as Chairman. On the
                      third anniversary of the Merger, he will retire as an officer and employee of L3Harris and resign as a member of our Board. > Mr. Kubasik will serve as Vice Chairman, President and COO through the second anniversary of the Merger (or, if earlier, the date that Mr. Brown ceases to serve as our CEO), at
                      which point he will become our CEO. On the third anniversary of the Merger, Mr. Kubasik will become our Chairman. The employment agreements with Mr. Brown and Mr. Kubasik are described in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Employment Agreements” beginning on page 52. Our Board believes that its current leadership structure provides independent board leadership and oversight while also benefiting from having Mr. Brown serve as Chairman as well as CEO, and
          that Mr. Brown has demonstrated the strong leadership and vision necessary to drive our strategies and achieve our objectives while so serving. Our Board believes that Mr. Brown’s in-depth knowledge of our business and its challenges and
          opportunities, as well as his extensive understanding of our day-to-day operations and his ability to provide insight and direction on important strategic initiatives, make him well-positioned to chair regular Board meetings and to bring key
          business and stakeholder issues to our Board’s attention. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 23 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BOARD




























                          LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE Role of Lead Independent Director When our Chairman is not an independent director, our independent directors (by affirmative majority vote) designate one independent Board
                        member to serve as Lead Independent Director. Service as Lead Independent Director generally is for a one-year term commencing on the date of our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Until the third anniversary of the completion of the
                        Merger, our Lead Independent Director must be a director designated by L3 prior to the Merger, who may be removed as Lead Independent Director prior to that anniversary only with the approval of at least 75% of the other
                        then-serving independent directors. The responsibilities and authority of our Lead Independent Director include: > Presiding at all meetings of our Board at which our Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of our independent directors; > Serving as liaison between our Chairman and our independent directors; > Approving the information sent to
                              our Board and the meeting agendas for our Board; > Approving our Board meeting schedules to assure sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; > Calling meetings of our independent directors; > Being available for consultation and direct communication with major shareholders, if they request and consistent with our policies regarding shareholder communications; > Providing timely feedback from executive sessions of our independent directors to our CEO or other members of senior management; > Playing a key role in the annual CEO and COO evaluation process, together with the Chairperson of our Compensation Committee (or the Chairperson of our
                            Nominating and Governance Committee if the same individual is serving as Lead Independent Director and Chairperson of our Compensation Committee); > Playing a key role in our Board’s annual self-evaluation process and related matters, together with the Chairperson of our Nominating and Governance Committee (or the Chairperson of our Compensation Committee if the same
                              individual is serving as Lead Independent Director and Chairperson of our Nominating and Governance Committee); > Guiding and playing a key role in the CEO succession planning process; and > Other responsibilities and authority as our Board may determine from time to time. The designation of a Lead Independent Director is not intended to inhibit communications among our directors or between any of them and
                        our Chairman. Executive Sessions of Independent Directors Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that at least two-thirds of the directors on our Board be independent directors. The agenda for each regularly scheduled Board meeting includes an executive session of
            independent directors, which is chaired by our Lead Independent Director. The agenda for each regularly scheduled standing committee meeting (other than quarterly earnings review meetings of our Audit Committee) likewise includes an executive
            session of independent directors. An important part of the executive sessions of independent directors of our Board and its standing committees is the discussion of results from the annual self-evaluations
          undertaken by our Board and its standing committees, which are described below. Self-Evaluations by our Board and Committees Our Board and its standing committees undertake annual self-evaluations designed to foster continuous improvement in performance and effectiveness. Our Nominating and Governance Committee
          facilitates our Board’s annual self-evaluation. Directors are asked to consider areas such as our Board’s role, relations with management, composition and meetings, and committee members are asked to consider areas such as the committee’s role
          and the responsibilities articulated in its charter, its composition and its operation. Self-evaluations may be undertaken utilizing written questionnaires, facilitated discussions or other means, as determined by our Board or the applicable
          committee. As noted above, review and discussion of the self-evaluation process and results occurs in executive session of our Board or the applicable committee. 24 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE Director Independence Standards Our Board assesses the independence of our directors and examines the nature and extent of any relationships between us and our
              directors, their families and their affiliates. Our Board is guided in this assessment by our Director Independence Standards, available on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.l3harris.com/corporate-governance. For a director to be considered independent, our Board must affirmatively determine that the director does not have any direct or indirect material relationship with us, other than as a
            director. When assessing the materiality of a director’s relationship with us, our Board will consider the issue not merely from the standpoint of the director, but also from the standpoint of persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation. Material relationships can include commercial, industrial,
              banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships, among others. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board undertook a review of director independence in February 2020, which included a review of the responses of each
          director to questions regarding his or her commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships, and discussions with the director. Based on the NYSE listing standards and our Director Independence
          Standards, our Board has affirmatively determined in its business judgment that each director, with the exception of Mr. Brown, our Chairman and CEO, and Mr. Kubasik, our Vice Chairman, President and COO, is independent and has no direct or
          indirect material relationship with L3Harris, other than as a director, that impairs the director’s independence. In connection with its independence determination, our Board considered that we conduct business with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Mr. Millard is chair
          of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Corporation. In no instances did the amount received by us or such other organization in our fiscal transition period exceed the greater of $1 million or 1% of either our or such other organization’s
          consolidated gross revenues. Mr. Millard did not have any interest in these transactions and was not involved in decisions regarding us with respect to these transactions. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 25 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BOARD
                        COMMITTEES BOARD COMMITTEES Our Board currently has four standing committees to assist in discharging its responsibilities: Audit, Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Governance. Our Board also
          has an Ad Hoc Technology Committee that provides oversight of technology and innovation processes, initiatives and talent. Each committee regularly reports its activities and actions to our full Board, generally at the next Board meeting following the committee meeting. Our Board has adopted a
          written charter for each committee. The charters of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee comply with the NYSE corporate governance requirements. There are no NYSE requirements with respect to our
          Finance Committee charter. Copies of all standing committee charters and our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.l3harris.com/corporate-governance and also are available to shareholders upon written request to our
            Secretary at L3Harris Technologies, Inc., 1025 West NASA Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32919. Each standing committee’s principal functions are summarized below, with a more detailed description of purposes and responsibilities contained in its

All of the directors taken together attended 100% of such
            meetings of our Board and its committees on which they served. In addition to meetings at our corporate headquarters, our Board periodically holds meetings at other facilities and locations. We typically schedule a Board meeting in conjunction with our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. In the absence of unavoidable conflict, all Board members are expected to attend each Annual
            Meeting of Shareholders. All of our Board members attended our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Related Person Transaction Policy Our Board has adopted a written policy and procedures for the review, approval and ratification of transactions among L3Harris and our directors and executive officers and their related
            interests. The policy supplements the conflicts of interest policies set forth in our Code of Conduct and our other internal policies and procedures. Under the related person transaction policy, all related person transactions are to be
            reviewed by our Nominating and Governance Committee. Our Nominating and Governance Committee may approve or ratify a related person transaction if, in its business judgment, it determines that the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with,
            the best interests of L3Harris and our shareholders. This may include situations where we provide to or receive from related persons products or services on an arm’s-length basis on terms comparable to those provided to or received from
            unrelated third parties. Any director who participates in or is the subject of an existing or potential related person transaction may not participate in the review, approval or ratification of the related person transaction. Under the policy and consistent with SEC rules, a related person transaction is any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which L3Harris was, is or will be a participant, where the
            amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which a related person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. A related person includes any of our directors, nominees for director or executive officers, any person who is known to
            be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our common stock, an immediate family member of any person described above and any firm, corporation or other entity controlled by any person described above. The policy requires that each
            director and executive officer annually complete a questionnaire to identify his or her related interests and persons and notify us of changes to that information. Before entering into a proposed related person transaction, the related person
            or involved business area of L3Harris is requested to notify our Secretary of the facts and circumstances of the proposed transaction. If the Secretary determines that the proposed transaction is a related person transaction, it shall be
            submitted to our Nominating and Governance Committee for review and consideration. A related person transaction entered into without our Nominating and Governance Committee’s prior approval will not violate this policy or be unenforceable, so
            long as the transaction is brought to our Nominating and Governance Committee promptly after it is entered into or after it becomes apparent that the transaction is covered by this policy and is ratified by our Nominating and Governance
            Committee. Based on its holdings as reported on a Schedule 13G/A filed with the SEC, each of The Vanguard Group and BlackRock, Inc. beneficially owned more than 5% of our common stock as of February 28,
            2020. The Vanguard Group and certain of its affiliates provided asset management services in our fiscal transition period for our defined contribution and defined benefit plans, for which participants paid or will pay approximately $57,289.
            BlackRock, Inc. and certain of its affiliates provided asset management services in our fiscal transition period for certain of our defined contribution and defined benefit plans, for which participants paid or will pay approximately $799,891. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 29 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTOR




























                            COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS The agreements with each of The Vanguard Group and BlackRock, Inc. were negotiated on an arm’s-length basis, and the ownership of our common stock plays no role in the business relations
              between us and The Vanguard Group and BlackRock, Inc. In addition, we believe that the agreements represent standard terms and conditions for asset management services. In accordance with our then-existing related person transaction policy,
              the Harris Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee reviewed, ratified and approved the agreements entered into by Harris with The Vanguard Group and BlackRock, Inc. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS Our Board compensation program is intended to attract and retain directors with demonstrated ability, integrity, judgment and experience to fulfill their responsibility to oversee
              management and to develop and oversee the implementation of strategies aimed at creating sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders. The program also is intended to recognize the time commitments and potential liability associated with
              serving on the board of a public company. Our independent directors are not permitted to receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees from us, and we do not compensate our employee directors
              separately for service as a director. The form and amount of director compensation is annually reviewed and assessed by our Nominating and Governance Committee. The committee reviews compensation comparison peer group data and
              broad survey data concerning director compensation practices, levels and trends for companies comparable to us in revenue, businesses and complexity, as supplied by independent compensation consultants. If the committee believes any changes
              to director compensation are warranted, it makes recommendations for the Board to consider. Our Board compensation program, which reflects Board-approved changes in connection with the Merger that take into account the increased complexity of our business and operations resulting
              from the completion of the Merger, is described below. Cash and Equity-Based Retainers for Non-Employee Directors Effective following the completion of the Merger, our non-employee directors receive the following cash and equity-based retainers: > Board member: $130,000 annual cash retainer and $165,000 annual equity-based retainer in the form of director share units (described in more detail below) > Lead Independent Director: $35,000 annual cash retainer > Chairperson of Audit Committee: $30,000 annual cash retainer > Chairperson of any other standing committee: $20,000 annual cash retainer Each cash retainer is payable on a quarterly basis in arrears and pro-rated based on period of service if a director does not serve for the entire quarter. For the equity-based retainer, each year at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders, non-employee directors will be granted a number of director share units under the Harris Corporation 2015
              Equity Incentive Plan (or any successor equity compensation plan adopted by L3Harris) calculated by dividing $165,000 by the fair market value of one share of L3Harris common stock on the grant date (rounded down to the nearest whole share).
              The director share units generally will fully vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date, subject to the non-employee director’s continued service and the terms and conditions of the non-employee director’s director share unit
              agreement. If a non-employee director becomes a director after an Annual Meeting of Shareholders, he or she will be granted a pro-rated director share unit award based on the period of the non-employee director’s service on our Board during
              the year. During our fiscal transition period from June 29, 2019 to January 3, 2020, the director share unit award for each non-employee director made at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders was calculated based on a grant date value of
              $82,500 instead of $165,000, reflective of the six-month fiscal transition period. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors On June 29, 2019, our Board adopted the L3Harris Technologies, Inc. 2019 Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the “L3Harris Director Deferred Compensation Plan”), an unfunded,
              non-qualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of our non-employee directors, which became effective December 31, 2019. Under the L3Harris Director Deferred Compensation Plan, prior to the commencement of a calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2020, each non-employee director of L3Harris may elect
              to defer all or a portion of cash retainer fees to be earned and director share units to be granted in the subsequent year or years. (Special rules govern the timing of deferral elections by new non-employee directors who join our Board after
              a calendar year has commenced.) 30 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS Any cash retainer deferred will be credited as deferred units (each deferred unit is equivalent in value to one share of L3Harris common stock) to the non-employee director’s account as of
              the date the retainer would have otherwise been paid. The number of deferred units credited will be equal to the cash retainer amount deferred as of such date divided by the fair market value of L3Harris common stock on such date. Any
              director share unit award deferred will be credited as deferred units to the non-employee director’s account as of the date on which the director share units vest. Each deferred unit is credited with dividend equivalents equal to dividends paid on L3Harris common stock, which are deemed reinvested in additional deferred units on the dividend payment
              date. Deferred units will be appropriately adjusted in the event of any change in L3Harris common stock through a merger, consolidation, or otherwise; a stock dividend; or a stock split, combination or other change in L3Harris common stock. Payment will be made in shares of L3Harris common stock equal to the number of deferred units credited to the director’s account (with any fractional deferred units paid in cash based on
              the fair market value of one share of L3Harris common stock on the payment date). A director may elect to receive deferred amounts either in a lump sum on a date certain within 90 days after his or her resignation or retirement or in up to 10
              annual installments over a designated number of years beginning on a date certain within 90 days after his or her resignation or retirement. Within 90 days following a non-employee director’s death, a lump sum equal to the then-remaining
              balance in his or her account will be made to his or her beneficiary. Within 10 business days after a change in control (as defined in the Harris Corporation 2015 Equity Incentive Plan) and to the extent permitted by Federal tax laws, each
              non-employee director (or former non-employee director) will receive a cash lump sum equal to the number of deferred units credited to his or her account on the date of the change in control, multiplied by the fair market value of one share
              of L3Harris common stock on such date. If payment within 10 business days following a change in control is not permitted by Federal tax laws, then payment will be made at the time and in the form that payment would have been made if a change
              in control had not occurred. Reimbursement, Insurance and Charitable Gift Matching We pay or reimburse each non-employee director for travel and out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with attending Board and committee meetings and other meetings on our
              behalf and attending director education programs. On occasion, spouses or guests are invited to accompany directors to Board-related events, and we cover their travel and related expenses. We also provide each non-employee director with accidental death and dismemberment insurance of up to $200,000 and business travel insurance of up to an additional $200,000 in the event
              that he or she is involved in an accident while traveling on business relating to our affairs, and we pay the premiums for such insurance. The premiums for coverage during our fiscal transition period for all non-employee directors
              collectively amounted to less than $500. We also provide liability insurance coverage for all of our directors and officers. Non-employee directors may participate in the same charitable gift matching program available to our employees, under which our foundation matches contributions to eligible educational
              institutions and tax-exempt organizations up to an annual maximum of $10,000 per director and per employee. Indemnification Agreements We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and Board-elected officers, including the executive officers named in the Fiscal Transition Period Summary
              Compensation Table on page 62. Under these agreements, we indemnify directors and officers with respect to their activities as a director, officer, employee or agent of L3Harris, or when serving at our request as a director, officer, employee
              or agent or in any other capacity for another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid
              in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or other proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal,
              including appeals, to which they were, are or are threatened to be made, parties as a result of their service to us. Under the indemnification agreements, each director or officer will continue to be so indemnified with respect to his or her
              service to or for us even after ceasing to occupy a position as an officer, director, employee or agent of L3Harris. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 31 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTOR

(2) Reflects the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation —
                          Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”) with respect to director share units awarded in our fiscal transition period. Under ASC 718, the fair value of the director share unit awards was determined as of the grant date using the closing market price of L3Harris common stock on the grant date. These
                        amounts reflect our accounting for these awards and do not necessarily correspond to the actual values that may be realized by directors. As of January 3, 2020, our non-employee directors had the following aggregate number of director share units outstanding: Ms. Bailey — 412 units; Gen. Chiarelli — 412 units; Mr.
                        Corcoran — 412 units; Mr. Dattilo — 412 units; Mr. Fradin — 412 units; Mr. Hay — 412 units; Mr. Kramer — 412 units; Ms. Lane — 412 units; Mr. Millard — 412 units; and Mr. Newton — 412 units. (3) Stock options were not an element of compensation for our non-employee directors, and consequently, non-employee directors held no stock options as of January 3, 2020. (4) There were no above-market or preferential earnings in the L3Harris Director Deferred Compensation Plan, which became effective December 31, 2019. (5) As noted above, our non-employee directors were eligible to participate in our foundation’s charitable gift matching program up to an annual maximum of $10,000 per director.
                          Although directors participated on the same basis as our employees, SEC rules require disclosure of the amount of a director’s participation in a gift matching program. The amounts shown for Mr. Corcoran, Ms. Lane and Mr. Newton
                          reflect charitable gift matching payments made during our fiscal transition period. 32 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents PROPOSAL 2: TO APPROVE, IN AN ADVISORY VOTE, THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Our Board unanimously recommends voting FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. > Executive compensation decisions were made by
                              independent members of our Board and Compensation Committee. > Executive compensation for our fiscal transition
                              period reflected pay-for-performance alignment, with strong fiscal transition period financial results and strong 1-year, 3-year and 5-year total shareholder return (“TSR”) results. As at past Annual Meetings and as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and related SEC rules, we are asking our shareholders to vote, on a
                non-binding, advisory basis, to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. We encourage you, before voting, to review this entire proxy statement, and particularly the Compensation
                Discussion and Analysis section on pages 35-59, the Compensation Tables section on pages 62-71 and the Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control section on pages 72-84. The overall objective of our executive compensation program is to encourage and reward the creation of
                  sustainable, long-term shareholder value . Our guiding principles, shown on page 39 and summarized below, provide a framework for our executive compensation program to meet this objective. Specifically, our program is designed to: > Directly align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders. > Provide competitive compensation and benefits to attract, motivate and retain executives that drive our desired business results. > Ensure that a significant portion of compensation is at-risk and based on company and personal performance so as to motivate achievement of our financial goals and
                                    strategic objectives. > Align an executive’s realized pay with his or her performance through above-target compensation for above-target performance and below-target compensation for below-target
                              performance. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 33 Table of Contents PROPOSAL 2: TO
                            APPROVE, IN AN ADVISORY VOTE, THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS We believe that our executive compensation program helped to incentivize our executives, was integral to achieving our strong fiscal transition period financial results and strong 1-year,
              3-year and 5-year TSR results, and appropriately rewarded executives for that performance. Please note that your vote on this proposal is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, it relates to the overall compensation of our named executive officers
              as disclosed in this proxy statement under SEC rules. Also, the vote is advisory, which means that the results are not binding on us. However, our Board and our Compensation Committee, which are responsible for designing and administering our
              executive officer compensation program, value the opinions expressed by our shareholders and will consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding compensation for our named executive officers. Shareholders will be voting on the following resolution: “RESOLVED, that the shareholders of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. hereby approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in the L3Harris
              Technologies, Inc. proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Fiscal Transition Period Summary Compensation Table and other related tables and accompanying
              footnotes and narratives.” We currently hold our advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers (“Say-on-Pay vote”) annually. Shareholders have an opportunity to cast
              an advisory vote on the frequency of the Say-on-Pay vote at least every six years, and the next advisory vote on the frequency of the Say-on-Pay vote will be at our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 34 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Executive Summary 35 Our Executive Compensation Philosophy and

It also
              discusses and analyzes the basis for the compensation paid with respect to our fiscal transition period to our named executive officers shown in the Fiscal Transition Period Summary Compensation Table on page 62 and the related tables and
              narrative discussion thereafter. How Recent Corporate Events Affect This CD&A This CD&A contains information about our named executive officers’ compensation relating to our most recent fiscal period ended January 3, 2020. When reviewing the information presented
              here and considering your vote for Proposal 2, it is important to take note of the following circumstances: Compensation reported for abbreviated 6-month fiscal transition period vs. full fiscal years. In
                connection with the Merger, we changed our fiscal year end from the Friday nearest June 30 to the Friday nearest December 31. This transition to a calendar year oriented financial reporting cycle resulted in an abbreviated six-month “fiscal
                transition period” of June 29, 2019 through January 3, 2020, so the compensation of our executives for the fiscal transition period reflects that shorter time frame. Prior fiscal periods referred to in this proxy statement, by contrast,
                were our full fiscal years ended June 28, 2019 (fiscal 2019), June 29, 2018 (fiscal 2018) and June 30, 2017 (fiscal 2017). Post-merger vs. pre-merger information. As noted above, the Merger was completed on June 29, 2019,
                after the end of our fiscal 2019. Our abbreviated fiscal transition period reflects the results for the combined company, L3Harris, whereas our fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 results reflect standalone results for Harris (not for L3 or
                L3Harris). The description in this proxy statement of our executive compensation program, and of the philosophy, principles and key practices that shape it, apply for L3Harris and also generally applied for Harris prior to the
              Merger. (In this proxy statement, references to the “Harris Board,” the “L3 Board” and the “Harris Compensation Committee” are references to the Harris Board of Directors, the L3 Board of Directors and the Harris Management Development and
              Compensation Committee, respectively, prior to the completion of the Merger.)

Fiscal Transition Period Performance BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT We are an agile global aerospace and defense technology innovator, delivering end-to-end solutions that meet customers’ mission-critical needs. We provide advanced defense and commercial
                technologies across air, land, sea, space and cyber domains. As of the end of our 6-month fiscal transition period, we had approximately $9 billion in revenue (or approximately $18 billion on an annualized basis) and about 48,000 employees,
                with customers in over 130 countries. In our fiscal transition period, we derived approximately 73% of our revenue from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, both directly
                and through prime contractors. Our common stock is listed under ticker symbol “LHX” on the NYSE. KEY FINANCIAL RESULTS Our strong fiscal transition period financial results reflected our successful execution against the key strategic priorities we set for our fiscal transition period. Those key strategic
                priorities were: > Executing seamless integration of L3 and Harris, including achieving at least $500 million in gross cost synergies from the Merger by the end of 2021; > Driving flawless execution and margin expansion through our e3 (excellence everywhere every day) operational excellence program; > Building a new performance culture with a strong bias for action and accountability; > Growing revenue through investments in differentiated technology and innovation; > Reshaping our portfolio to focus on high margin, high growth businesses; and > Maximizing cash flow with shareholder friendly capital deployment.

In
                particular, our revenue of $9.263 billion exceeded target of $9.229 billion, our adjusted EBIT of $1.601 billion exceeded target of $1.537 billion, and our adjusted free cash flow of $1.449 billion exceeded target of $1.328 billion. Based on these and prior-period results, we delivered strong 1-year, 3-year and 5-year cumulative TSR results relative to companies in the S&P 500 and to the
                median of our compensation comparison peer group for our fiscal transition period, as shown below: TSR Results (1) at End of Fiscal Transition Period ■ L3Harris Technologies, Inc. ■ S&P 500 ■ Compensation Comparison Peer Group, Median (1) TSR results reflect reinvestment of dividends. As noted above, the closing of the Merger occurred on June 29, 2019, and thus TSR results reflect L3Harris results for the fiscal
                          transition period and Harris standalone results for prior periods. Target Pay Mix for Fiscal Transition Period In accordance with our principle of aligning pay with performance, the percentage of total target direct compensation for our fiscal transition period that was at risk was 90% for our CEO,
                63% for our COO and 75% for our other named executive officers, on average. Under our incentive plans, compensation may be at risk either because it is performance based (payouts depend on achievement relative to pre-established performance
                goals) or time-based (equity awards subject to delayed vesting and thus the risk of a potential decrease in the price of our common stock price). For the calculations below, total target direct compensation for our 6-month fiscal transition period includes 50% of annual base salary level, the target value of annual cash incentive
                awards (which were granted at 50% of full-year values) and the target value of annual cycle awards of long-term equity-based incentive compensation (also granted at 50% of full-year values); but does not include the target value of the
                special, one-time integration-related long-term equity-based incentive compensation awards (which are entirely performance based and at risk) or other compensation elements such as retirement, severance, health, welfare or other personal
                benefits; transition or relocation benefits; or payouts that occurred in our fiscal transition period as a result of the Merger. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 37 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CEO, COO and Other Named Executive Officer Fiscal Transition Period Target Direct Compensation Mix Target Pay Mix for 2020 In connection with returning to a more typical annual compensation cycle for fiscal 2020 (which commenced January 4, 2020) and in accordance with our principle of aligning pay with
                performance, the percentage of total target direct compensation for 2020 that is at risk is 90% for our CEO, 90% for our COO and 79% for our other named executive officers, on average. For the calculations below, total target direct compensation for fiscal 2020 includes annual base salary level, the target value of annual cash incentive awards and the target value of
                annual cycle awards of long-term equity-based incentive compensation (which consists of our more typical historic mix of performance share units, stock options and restricted stock units); but does not include other compensation elements
                such as retirement, severance, health, welfare or other personal benefits; or transition or relocation benefits. CEO, COO and Other Named Executive Officer 2020 Target Direct Compensation Mix 38 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICES Shareholder Engagement on Executive Compensation and “Say-on-Pay” Results As part of our shareholder outreach, we seek shareholder views and input on our executive compensation program. In fact, past input received from our large shareholders influenced our
              determinations to adjust the weighting of certain financial performance measures under our annual cash incentive compensation plan and to alter the financial performance measures for our performance share units. In addition, as part of our
              investor relations engagement processes following transformative merger and acquisition activity (including the Merger), we have engaged with several among our larger shareholders to understand those metrics important to them to ensure the
              Merger is successful and delivers long-term shareholder value. As a result of that engagement, we altered our existing short- and long-term incentive plan designs to reflect their feedback. We expect to continue to seek the views and input of
              our large shareholders regarding our executive compensation program on a regular basis. At our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, approximately 94% of the shares voted on the “say-on-pay” proposal were cast in support of L3Harris’ fiscal 2019 executive compensation and related
              disclosures. At that time, our Compensation Committee viewed those results as broad shareholder support for L3Harris’ executive compensation program and consequently made no material changes to the program or to L3Harris’ compensation
              policies. Our Board and Compensation Committee will continue to consider input from shareholders, including through advisory votes on executive compensation, in making compensation decisions and reviewing executive compensation programs and
              policies. OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICES Overall Objective and Guiding Principles The overall objective of our executive compensation program is to encourage and reward the creation of sustainable, long-term shareholder value. Our guiding principles provide a framework for
              our executive compensation program to meet this objective. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Align with Shareholders’ Interests We believe an executive’s interests are directly aligned with our shareholders’ interests when our compensation programs appropriately balance short-and long-term financial performance, create a
                          “pay for profitable growth” environment, are impacted by our stock price performance and require meaningful ownership of our stock. Be Competitive at Target Performance Level We believe an executive’s total compensation should be competitive at the target performance level to motivate performance and to attract, retain, develop and reward executives who possess the
                          abilities and skills to build long-term shareholder value. Motivate Achievement of Financial Goals and Strategic Objectives We believe an effective way to incentivize an executive to create long-term shareholder value is to make a significant portion of overall compensation dependent on the achievement of our short-
                          and long-term financial goals and strategic objectives and on the value of our stock. Align Realized Pay with Performance We believe that although an executive’s total compensation should be tied to achievement of financial goals and strategic objectives and should be competitive at the target performance level,
                          above-target performance should be appropriately rewarded and there should be downside risk of below-target compensation if we do not achieve our financial goals and strategic objectives. Although compensation levels differ among our named executive officers based on competitive factors and their varying roles, responsibilities and performance, there are no material
              differences in the manner in which total target direct compensation is determined for any of our named executive officers or the compensation policies that apply to them. The material elements of our executive compensation program applicable
              to our named executive officers also apply to our other executive officers, except that not all executive officers were granted a special, one-time integration-related long-term equity-based incentive compensation award. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 39 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICES Key Practices In accordance with our overall objective and our guiding principles, we follow sound executive compensation practices that are designed to encourage and reward the creation of sustainable,
              long-term shareholder value. WHAT WE DO WHAT WE DON’T DO > Place executive compensation decisions in the hands of independent directors > Retain an independent executive compensation consulting firm > Periodically review and change composition of compensation comparison peer group, as appropriate > Make a significant portion of each executive’s overall compensation dependent on our performance against pre-determined targets for short- and long-term financial measures > Make a significant portion of each executive’s overall compensation opportunity equity-based to establish a strong link between compensation and our stock price performance and
                                to provide rewards in alignment with shareholder returns > Align performance share unit award payouts with our stock price performance through a relative TSR adjustment metric > Have meaningful stock ownership guidelines to maintain alignment of executives’ interests with those of our shareholders > Hold annual “say-on-pay” advisory vote and seek input of large shareholders on key aspects of our executive compensation program > Regularly review and evaluate plans for management development, succession and diversity > Pay cash severance under executive change in control severance agreements only on a “double trigger” basis > Have a “clawback” policy to recover cash and equity incentive payments from executives if our financial statements are restated due to errors, omissions or fraud > Provide for accelerated vesting of equity-based compensation granted after fiscal 2019 only on a “double trigger” basis > Maintain a 12-month minimum vesting period for annual cycle awards of equity-based compensation, except in the case of death, disability or a qualifying termination after a
                                change in control > Provide

In approving compensation levels and targets,
              individual objectives and financial performance measure targets for our named executive officers, our Compensation Committee reviews the relationship between our executive compensation program and the achievement of our financial goals and
              strategic objectives, with an emphasis on creating a “pay for profitable growth” environment. ROLE OF INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT Our Compensation Committee has the authority to retain compensation consultants and other advisors to assist it in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities and has directly retained FW
              Cook—a nationally recognized, independent executive compensation consulting firm—to provide it with objective analysis, recommendations on plan design, competitive market data and other advice and information related to CEO and COO
              compensation and the compensation of other executive officers. (FW Cook also served in a comparable capacity for the L3 Compensation Committee prior the Merger.) FW Cook performs these services solely at the direction and under the
              supervision of our Compensation Committee and does not provide any other services for, or receive other remuneration from, L3Harris. Prior to the Merger, the Harris Compensation Committee had comparable authority and directly retained Pearl Meyer & Partners (“PM”), a nationally recognized, independent executive
              compensation consulting firm, for similar purposes, and the Harris Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee separately retained PM to provide it with similar types of analysis, recommendations, advice and information related to the
              compensation of non-employee directors. PM performed these services solely at the direction and under the supervision of the applicable committee and did not provide any other services for, or receive other remuneration from, Harris. PM’s
              services in fiscal 2019 included providing recommendations to the Harris Compensation Committee prior to the Merger on the compensation arrangements for our CEO and COO following the Merger. With regard to FW Cook’s services related to CEO and other executive officer compensation, our Compensation Committee has sole authority to modify or approve FW Cook’s remuneration,
              determine the nature and scope of its services, evaluate its performance, terminate the engagement and engage a replacement or additional consultant at any time. Our Compensation Committee also regularly meets with FW Cook in executive
              session, without our CEO or other members of management present. Taking into consideration the independence factors in the NYSE listing standards and SEC rules, our Compensation Committee has made the determination that, in its business
              judgment, FW Cook was independent and that its work did not raise any conflicts of interest. ROLE OF CEO Our Compensation Committee considers recommendations from our CEO, with input from our COO, in making decisions regarding our executive compensation program and the compensation of our
              other executive officers. During the annual compensation planning process, our CEO recommends targets for all incentive compensation programs. The targets are based on our Board-approved annual operating plan and long-term strategic plan. As
              part of the annual performance review process, which includes an assessment of each executive officer’s performance against individual objectives, our CEO, with input from our COO, presents an evaluation of each executive officer’s
              contributions (including both strengths and development needs), reviews succession plans for each executive position, and recommends specific compensation for the other executive officers, including base salary level adjustments and annual
              cash incentive and equity awards. Annual Compensation Cycle Our Board and Compensation Committee generally follow an annual compensation cycle with respect to each new fiscal year as described below, and they generally followed that cycle for our
              abbreviated six-month fiscal transition period, making adjustments as they deemed necessary to accommodate the shorter time frame (for example, approving target compensation values and granting equity awards earlier in the process; and
              approving annual cash incentive award target values and annual cycle equity award target values at 50% of full-year values). We returned to our typical annual compensation cycle starting with our fiscal year 2020 (which commenced January 4,
              2020). With respect to the compensation decisions described below, the independent directors of our Board make all final compensation decisions for our CEO and COO (typically based on the
              recommendation of our Compensation Committee in both cases), and our Compensation Committee makes them for other executive officers. These decisions include: determining the types and levels of benefits; establishing performance measures,
              weightings and targets; setting target compensation values; granting equity awards and determining payouts. As noted below in the “Employment Agreements” section of this CD&A, the base salary level, annual cash incentive and annual cycle
              awards of long-term equity-based incentive compensation for our CEO and COO, as well as the special, one-time integration-related long-term equity-based incentive compensation awards for our CEO and COO, are required to be the same pursuant
              to our employment agreements with them. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 41 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICES WHAT WE DO PRIOR TO OR EARLY IN A NEW FISCAL YEAR Consider program design changes Determine what changes, if any, should be made to the executive compensation program for the new fiscal year (after receiving input from our CEO, COO and independent
                            compensation consultant, and an assessment of compensation trends and competitive market data). Set target compensation values The process for setting target compensation values includes a review of: > the executive’s three-year compensation history, including base salary level and annual cash incentive and
                                equity awards; > the types and levels of other benefits available to the executive, such as change in control severance
                                arrangements; and > compensation comparison peer group data or broad compensation
                                market data, including surveys. Establish performance measures and targets and individual
                                performance objectives Establish: > short- and long-term financial performance measures and their relative weighting and associated targets for performance-based, at-risk elements of compensation for the new fiscal year; and > individual performance objectives for each executive and for his or her business unit or organization. These measures, weightings and targets and performance objectives are intended to align with our Board-approved annual operating plan and long-term strategic plan and create a
                            “pay for profitable growth environment” and thereby encourage and reward the creation of sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders. Make equity grants Annual equity award grants to executive officers are made at meetings, the dates for which usually are set one year or more in advance, and annual equity award grants to our
                            other eligible employees typically are made on the same date. We do not time equity grants to take advantage of information, either positive or negative, about us that has not been publicly disclosed. In special circumstances, such as new hires or promotions or for retention or recognition, grants may occur outside of the typical cycle. Under a policy adopted by our
                            Compensation Committee, such grants are made on the first trading day of the month following the hiring, promotion or other event (if this day falls during a “quiet period” under our insider trading policy, then on the first
                            trading day after such period ends). WHAT WE DO AFTER THAT FISCAL YEAR ENDS Conduct performance reviews > For our CEO and COO, the independent directors of our Board conduct a performance review, evaluating such executive officer’s achievement of objectives
                                  established early in the fiscal year, other accomplishments, overall company performance and such executive officer’s self-evaluation of performance for the fiscal year. This review occurs in executive session, under the
                                  leadership of our Compensation Committee Chairperson and without our CEO, COO or other members of management present. > For our other executive officers, our CEO, with input from our COO, provides our Compensation Committee with specific compensation
                                  recommendations based on a review and assessment of each executive officer’s performance, including achievement of objectives established early in the fiscal year for the executive
                          and his or her business unit or organization, contribution to company performance and other accomplishments. Determine payouts Payouts of performance-based, at-risk elements of compensation to executives are determined based on performance reviews relative to pre-determined objectives and formulaic
                          calculations of our financial results for the fiscal year against pre-determined targets, typically after audited financial statements become available approximately two months after the fiscal year end. For fiscal 2019, due to the then-impending closing of the Merger, performance reviews were conducted and payouts of performance-based elements of compensation to Harris executive officers
                were approved on June 28, 2019, immediately before fiscal 2019 ended, instead of after the fiscal year ended as in a typical compensation cycle. For our abbreviated fiscal transition period, which began June 29, 2019 and ended January 3,
                2020, in connection with selecting executives for roles in the combined Company after the Merger, target compensation values and equity-based compensation awards for executives were approved within the first month following the completion
                of the Merger, with equity-based compensation awards granted on August 1, 2019 (the first trading day after our “quiet period” ended, in accordance with our insider trading policy). 42 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICES Competitive Considerations BENCHMARKING Our Board and Compensation Committee set total target direct compensation for our CEO, COO and other executives in their discretion (including based on factors such as experience, position,
              responsibilities, tenure and contributions), but generally within the range of 20% below to 20% above the median of total target direct compensation for comparable positions in our compensation comparison peer group (to the extent such data
              is available) and after considering other broad compensation market data, including surveys. For our fiscal transition period, our Human Resources Department performed a comprehensive assessment and benchmarking of the competitive
              compensation positioning of our CEO, COO and other executive officers and the mix and elements of their compensation, primarily focusing on our compensation comparison peer group, but also using broad general industry and aerospace and
              defense compensation market data. For our fiscal transition period, our Compensation Committee also engaged FW Cook to review, assess and validate our Human Resources Department’s assessment and benchmarking process. COMPENSATION COMPARISON PEER GROUP Our compensation comparison peer group is used to assess the competitiveness of the compensation of our CEO, COO and other executive officers. We seek to include companies that compete with
              us for executive talent and are similar to us in industry, business model, revenue and/or market capitalization. Our Compensation Committee periodically reviews the composition of this peer group and makes changes it determines are
              appropriate based on changes to our businesses or to the attributes of companies in the group or the availability of their compensation data. Our independent compensation consultant, our CEO, our COO and management provide input to our
              Compensation Committee regarding changes to the attributes of peer companies. Compensation Comparison Peer Group for Fiscal Transition Period and 2020 (Companies added shown in red) Eaton Corporation plc Lockheed Martin Corporation Rockwell Automation, Inc. Emerson Electric Co. Motorola Solutions, Inc. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. General Dynamics Corporation Northrop Grumman Corporation Textron Inc. Honeywell International Inc. Parker Hannifin Corporation United Technologies Corporation Leidos Holdings, Inc. Raytheon Company Our compensation comparison peer group for our fiscal transition period initially was proposed by Aon, subsequently was reviewed and endorsed by FW Cook and PM in support of their
              respective work for the L3 and Harris Compensation Committees prior to the Merger, and was approved by the L3 and Harris Compensation Committees, in connection with L3 and Harris entering into the Merger Agreement and the employment
              arrangements with Messrs. Brown and Kubasik. The changes to our compensation comparison peer group for our fiscal transition period (compared with the previous compensation comparison peer group for Harris) were based on the larger size of
              our combined Company and refreshed business model following the Merger, with companies added shown in red in the table above and the following companies removed: > Companies removed: Curtiss-Wright Corporation, Huntington
                            Ingalls Industries, Inc., L3 Technologies, Inc., Orbital ATK, Inc., Rockwell Collins, Inc., Teledyne Technologies Incorporated and TransDigm Group Incorporated. Companies added to the group compete with L3Harris for executive talent and are similar to L3Harris following the Merger in industry, business model, revenue and/or
              market capitalization. Companies removed from the group generally were removed due to acquisitions by other companies, evolving business disparity or evolving revenue or market capitalization disparity. In August 2019, our Compensation Committee approved the same compensation comparison peer group for fiscal 2020 as was approved for our fiscal transition period. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 43 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OVERVIEW OF OUR MAIN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ELEMENTS OVERVIEW OF OUR MAIN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ELEMENTS The compensation program for our executive officers primarily consists of the following elements: > base salary; > annual cash incentive award compensation; and > equity-based long-term incentive compensation. As noted above, the overall objective of our compensation program is to encourage and reward the creation of sustainable, long-term shareholder value. Our Compensation Committee believes
              that the current elements of our executive compensation program further this objective. They directly align the interests of our executives and shareholders, are competitive, motivate achievement of our short- and long-term financial goals
              and strategic objectives and align realized pay with performance. We do not have a formal policy relating to the mix among the various elements of our compensation program. However, we believe that the greater an executive’s responsibility level and
              ability to influence results, the greater the portion of his or her overall compensation that should be performance-based, at-risk compensation. The equity-based long-term incentive compensation we granted in our fiscal transition period included restricted stock unit awards as part of our annual compensation
              cycle, as well as special, one-time integration-related awards consisting of performance share units and performance stock options. These awards are discussed in more detail below in this CD&A. For 2020, we returned to our more typical
              mix of types of equity-based awards for our annual long-term incentive compensation element—performance share units, stock options and restricted stock units. Base Salary Base salary reflects a fixed, stable portion of the overall compensation package and also generally serves as the base amount from which other compensation elements are determined. It
              represents a relatively small percentage of total target direct compensation, particularly for executive officers with greater responsibility and ability to influence results. Our Compensation Committee reviews executive base salary levels prior to or early in each fiscal year and whenever there is a substantial change in an executive’s responsibilities or in
              market conditions. It generally targets an executive officer’s base salary level to fall between 20% below and 20% above the market median for comparable positions at companies in our compensation comparison peer group, and considers other
              relevant market data, including surveys. However, an executive’s base salary level also is influenced by his or her experience, position, responsibilities, tenure, contributions and individual performance, as well as current business
              conditions and our business outlook. Annual Cash Incentive We provide our executive officers the opportunity to earn annual cash incentive compensation under our Annual Incentive Plan. Awards under this plan are structured to provide payouts
              ranging from 0% to 200% of pre-established award target values, depending on: > our performance against specific pre-determined financial performance measures; and > named executive officer performance against pre-determined individual objectives and contribution to our overall results. For executives, this structure creates: > the upside potential of above-target payouts if our financial performance is above target; and > the downside risk of below-target payouts if our financial performance is below target. Through this structure, the annual cash incentive motivates our executives to focus on achieving or exceeding pre-determined financial performance measure targets and individual objectives
              strategically chosen to align with the interests of our shareholders. SETTING AWARD TARGET VALUES As described above in “Annual Compensation Cycle,” early in the fiscal year, an annual cash incentive compensation award target value is set for each executive officer. For the named
              executive officers, these target values generally are set as a percentage of base salary level, using as a reference point either compensation comparison peer group data (if such data is available for a comparable position) or broad
              compensation market data, including surveys. The independent directors of our Board (based on the recommendation of our Compensation Committee) set target values for our CEO and COO, and our 44 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OVERVIEW OF OUR MAIN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ELEMENTS Compensation Committee sets them for other executive officers. (As noted above, target values for our fiscal transition period were 50% of full-year values, reflecting the 6-month duration
              of our fiscal transition period.) ESTABLISHING METRICS AND INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES Also early in the fiscal year, specific financial performance measures and their relative weighting and associated targets and thresholds are established, as well as individual performance
              objectives for each executive officer. Again, the independent directors of our Board (in the case of our CEO and COO) and our Compensation Committee (in the case of other executive officers) establish these metrics and objectives. As a general principle, we seek to establish targets for financial performance measures that are aligned with our annual operating plan and are challenging yet achievable. Targets are set
              at levels we believe require significant effort on the part of executives, yet also represent a reasonable expectation of financial results based on prior-year performance, existing business conditions, the markets in which we participate and
              our outlook. DETERMINING PAYOUTS The independent directors of our Board (in the case of our CEO and COO) and our Compensation Committee (in the case of other executive officers) determine and approve payouts of
              performance-based, cash incentive compensation under our Annual Incentive Plan, based on formulaic calculations of our financial results against pre-determined financial performance measure targets, as well as performance reviews relative to
              pre-determined objectives for the fiscal year. Pre-determined objectives generally emphasize ethics; compliance and safety; operational excellence; talent; engagement; diversity and inclusion; and environmental, social and governance focus
              areas. Payout determinations typically occur after audited financial statements become available (approximately two months after the end of each fiscal year). In certain instances, as permitted under our Annual Incentive Plan, financial
              performance measure targets and our actual results may be adjusted in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting us or our financial statements, such as items that are determined not to be reflective of normal, ongoing business
              operations. At the request of the Chairperson of our Audit Committee, our Internal Audit Department independently verifies calculations for Annual Incentive Plan payouts. For corporate executives, payouts are based 100% on consolidated L3Harris results; for segment presidents, payouts are based 50% on segment results and 50% on consolidated L3Harris results;
              and for other segment executives, payouts are based 80% on segment results and 20% on consolidated L3Harris results. Long-Term Incentives We provide long-term incentive compensation to executive officers under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (our “Equity Incentive Plan”). Long-term incentive compensation is designed to
              motivate our executives to focus on achievement of our long-term financial goals and strategic objectives. TYPES OF EQUITY AWARDS USED We award different types of equity-based compensation because we believe that each type incentivizes and rewards shareholder value creation in a different way. Equity awards also are
              intended to retain executives, encourage share ownership and maintain a direct link between our executive compensation program and the value and appreciation in value of our stock. Types of awards we typically use are: > Performance share units. Performance share unit awards motivate
                            our executives to achieve our multi-year financial and operating goals because the number of units ultimately earned depends on how we perform, generally over a three-year performance period, against financial performance
                            measures and their relative weighting and associated targets established early in the first fiscal year of each performance period. As with all forms of equity-based compensation, the value of performance share units also is
                            impacted directly by increases or decreases in our stock price. > Stock options. Stock options motivate our executives to increase
                            shareholder value because the options have value, and compensation can be realized, only to the extent the price of our common stock increases between the grant date and the date of exercise. > Restricted stock units. Restricted stock unit awards primarily
                            facilitate retention and succession planning because they carry restrictions that typically expire only if the executive is still employed with us at the end of a three-year period. In limited circumstances, we also may grant performance stock options to better align compensation with execution against certain strategic initiatives, as well as shares of restricted
              stock and restricted stock unit awards to facilitate recruitment. As noted above, due to the special circumstances of the Merger, the types of equity-based compensation we granted in our fiscal transition period included restricted stock units in respect
              of our annual cycle awards of long-term incentive compensation, as well as special, one-time integration-related awards consisting of performance share units and performance L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 45 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OVERVIEW OF OUR MAIN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ELEMENTS stock options. These awards are discussed in more detail below in this CD&A. For fiscal 2020, we returned to our more typical mix of types of equity-based awards for our annual long-term
              incentive compensation element—performance share units, stock options and restricted stock units. SETTING AWARD TARGET VALUES Early in the fiscal year, the total target value for long-term equity incentive compensation awards is established for each executive officer. For the named executive officers, the target
              value typically is set using our compensation comparison peer group data as a reference point, if available for a comparable position, and/or other broad compensation market data, including surveys. The independent directors of our Board
              (based on the recommendation of our Compensation Committee) set target values for our CEO and COO, and our Compensation Committee sets them for other executive officers. DETERMINING THE MIX OF INCENTIVES FOR EACH EXECUTIVE Early in the fiscal year, the appropriate mix of types of equity-based compensation (i.e., the percentage of total award target value allocated to each type of award) is determined for each
              executive officer. The independent directors of our Board (based on the recommendation of our Compensation Committee) determine the mix for our CEO and COO, and our Compensation Committee determines the mix for other executive officers. These
              determinations are made after considering relevant data for our compensation comparison peer group, the retention value of each type of compensation and other factors important to us, including linking incentive compensation to performance;
              tax and accounting treatment; and our Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant’s recommendation. We then determine the specific numbers of units or options to be granted to each executive officer based on the applicable percentage of total award target value allocated to each type of
              award. For our fiscal transition period, we valued units or options using the grant date fair value method, consistent with the valuation method required for calculating amounts shown in the “Stock Awards” and “Option Awards” columns of the
              Fiscal Transition Period Summary Compensation Table on page 62, and we expect to use this valuation method in subsequent fiscal years. For fiscal 2019 and prior fiscal years, we valued units or options based on a 60-day average closing market
              price of our common stock prior to the grant date. PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS Establishing performance metrics. As described above in “Annual Compensation Cycle,” early in the
                first fiscal year of each multi-year performance period (generally three years), we establish specific financial performance measures and their relative weighting and associated targets and thresholds, which serve as the basis for measuring
                how we perform and for determining payouts. Performance share unit awards generally are structured to provide payouts in shares of our common stock ranging from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted under such
                awards. The independent directors of our Board (based on the recommendation of our Compensation Committee) establish the metrics for our CEO and COO, and our Compensation Committee establishes them for other executive officers. As a general principle, we seek to establish targets for financial performance measures that are aligned with our three-year strategic plan and are challenging yet achievable. Targets are
              set at levels we believe require significant effort on the part of executives, yet also represent a reasonable expectation of financial results based on prior-year performance, existing business conditions, the markets in which we participate
              and our outlook. Determining payouts. The independent directors of our Board (based on the recommendation of our Compensation Committee, in the case of our CEO and
              COO), and our Compensation Committee (in the case of other executive officers) determine and approve payouts under performance share unit awards for the multi-year performance period that concludes at the end of that fiscal year, based on
              formulaic calculations of our results against pre-determined financial performance measure targets for such performance period. Payout determinations typically occur after audited financial statements become available (approximately two
              months after the end of each fiscal year). In certain instances, as permitted under our Equity Incentive Plan, financial performance measure targets and our actual results may be adjusted in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events
              affecting us or our financial statements, such as items that are determined not to be reflective of normal, ongoing business operations. At the request of the Chairperson of our Audit Committee, our Internal Audit Department independently
              verifies calculations for payouts in respect of performance share unit awards. As previously disclosed in our proxy statement for our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, due to the special circumstances of the Merger, payouts in respect of performance share unit
              awards for the fiscal 2017-2019, fiscal 2018-2020 and fiscal 2019-2021 performance periods were determined and approved immediately before our fiscal 2019 ended in advance of the Merger closing on June 29, 2019. For details on such approval
              in fiscal 2019 and payouts in our fiscal transition period, see the Compensation and Discussion Analysis—Executive Compensation Decisions For Fiscal 2019—Long-Term Incentives discussion in our proxy statement for our 2019 Annual Meeting of
              Shareholders filed with the SEC on September 10, 2019. Due to the vesting and payouts of all then-outstanding performance share unit awards in connection with the end of fiscal 2019 and the Merger closing, no payout determinations in respect
              of performance share unit awards were required or made during our fiscal transition period. 46 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS FOR OUR SIX-MONTH FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD STOCK OPTIONS Stock options granted to our executive officers typically have the following terms: > Exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the grant date; > Vesting in equal installments of one-third each on the first, second and third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the recipient’s continued employment through the
                          applicable vesting date (except in the case of performance stock options granted in our fiscal transition period, which have “cliff” vesting of 100% on June 29, 2022, the third anniversary of the Merger, reflecting alignment with
                          the performance metric for those options); > Expiration 10 years from the grant date; and > “Double trigger” accelerated vesting (for options granted after fiscal 2019; accelerated vesting upon a change in control or other events for options granted through fiscal
                          2019). Stock options, including performance stock options, may not be repriced, replaced, modified or regranted through cancellation if the effect thereof would be to reduce
              the exercise price of such stock options, except with prior approval of our shareholders, or in connection with a change in our capitalization, including spin-offs. RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS Restricted stock or restricted stock units are used primarily to facilitate retention and succession planning and, in more limited circumstances, as a recruitment mechanism to replace the
              value of equity awards that an executive may have forfeited upon leaving a former employer. Restrictions on these awards, which typically expire at the end of a three-year period, provide that the shares or units may not be sold or otherwise
              transferred and will be immediately forfeited if the recipient’s employment ends for any reason other than involuntary termination without cause, voluntary termination for good reason, death, disability or retirement. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS FOR OUR SIX-MONTH FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD This section describes the compensation paid or awarded for our fiscal transition period to our named executive officers with respect to each major compensation element (base salary, annual
              cash incentive and long-term incentives) and how this compensation was determined. Timing of compensation decisions generally is described in the preceding sections on “Our Executive Compensation Philosophy and Practices” and “Overview of our
              Main Executive Compensation Elements.” Base Salary The table below shows the fiscal transition period annual base salary level for each named executive officer (including a comparison with fiscal 2019 for named executive officers who were
              employed with Harris in fiscal 2019). Annual Base Salary Levels: Fiscal Transition Period vs. Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2019 Annual Base Salary Level Fiscal Transition Period Annual Base Salary Level % Change Reason for Change Mr. Brown $ 1,350,000 $ 1,450,000 7.4 % Merit / market (larger company) Mr. Kubasik $ — $ 1,450,000 N/A N/A Mr. Malave $ — $ 625,000 N/A N/A Mr. Gautier $ — $ 600,000 N/A N/A Mr. Zoiss $ 500,000 $ 600,000 20 % Merit / market (larger business) Actual base salary amounts paid for our abbreviated 6-month fiscal transition period are shown in the “Salary” column of the Fiscal Transition Period Summary Compensation Table on page 62. Annual Cash Incentive AWARD TARGET VALUES FOR FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD The table below shows information regarding each named executive officer’s fiscal transition period annual cash incentive award target value under the Annual Incentive Plan. (As noted
              above, target values for our fiscal transition period were 50% of full-year values, reflecting the 6-month duration of our fiscal transition period.)

PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR OUR FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD The graphics below show the three financial performance measures and their relative weighting and associated performance targets for our fiscal transition period annual cash incentive
                awards under the Annual Incentive Plan for our named executive officers. The graphics also show how varying levels of performance would result in different payout percentages. The same financial performance measures, weighting and
                mathematical relationship between performance and payout percentages were approved for L3Harris as well as all four reporting segments, including our Aviation Systems segment and Space and Airborne Systems segment (which are relevant for
                Messrs. Gautier and Zoiss, respectively, in their roles as segment presidents). Our Board and Compensation Committee chose these performance measures and their relative weighting based on their business judgment that they would incentivize
                our performance against our key strategic priorities we set in our annual operating plan for our fiscal transition period (for example, executing seamless integration of L3 and Harris; driving flawless execution and margin expansion;
                growing revenue; and maximizing cash flow with shareholder friendly capital deployment).

                          reducing expenses. What we generate from normal business activities: can be increased by improving market share, introducing new products, entering new markets, enhancing execution and pricing
                          effectively.

                          resulting in a payout percentage of zero. PAYOUTS FOR FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD The first table below shows results for each financial performance measure for L3Harris as well as for our Aviation Systems segment (relevant for Mr. Gautier) and our Space and Airborne
                Systems segment (relevant for Mr. Zoiss). It also shows how we used those results to calculate weighted payout percentages for annual cash incentive awards under our Annual Incentive Plan. The second table shows how we used these weighted payout percentages to determine payouts for our named executive officers, linking their annual cash incentive award payouts under our
                Annual Incentive Plan to our fiscal transition period results for each pre-established financial performance measure. 48 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS FOR OUR SIX-MONTH FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD Annual Cash Incentive: Results and Payout Percentages for Fiscal Transition Period Financial Performance Measure Target1 (in millions) Result (in millions) Adjusted Result 2 (in millions) Adjusted Result Relative to Target Resulting Payout % Weighted Payout % L3HARRIS EBIT — 40 % $ 1,537 $ 1,031 $ 1,601 104.1 % 108.2 % 117.4% FCF — 40 % $ 1,328 $ 766 $ 1,450 109.2 % 135.2 % Revenue — 20 % $ 9,229 $ 9,263 $ 9,240 100.1 % 100.2 % AVIATION SYSTEMS SEGMENT EBIT — 40 % $ 316 $ 289 $ 289 91.5 % 80.7 % 70.7% FCF — 40 % $ 366 $ 288 $ 293 80.0 % 50.0 % Revenue — 20 % $ 2,123 $ 2,038 $ 2,038 96.0 % 92.0 % SPACE & AIRBORNE SYSTEMS SEGMENT EBIT — 40 % $ 441 $ 442 $ 442 100.2 % 100.4 % 140.7% FCF — 40 % $ 340 $ 441 $ 441 129.6 % 200.0 % Revenue — 20 % $ 2,329 $ 2,360 $ 2,360 101.3 % 102.6 % (1) The types of Merger-related adjustments to our adjusted results as described in footnote (2) below were anticipated when targets were approved and thus were reflected in the
                          targets, which makes them comparable. (2) Calculations are based on our financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted as permitted under our Annual Incentive Plan in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring
                          events affecting us or our financial statements. These adjustments are made in accordance with pre-established guidelines, including that any adjustment must be objectively measurable under GAAP. The reported EBIT result for L3Harris was increased $570 million on a net basis, reflecting the exclusion of $834 million of charges for Merger deal and integration costs,
              amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, the fair value step-up in inventory sold, cumulative adjustment to lease expense and losses and other costs related to debt refinancing, partially offset by the exclusion of $264 million of
              gains from the sales of businesses and assets and pension curtailment. The reported free cash flow result for L3Harris was increased $684 million for cash flow used for Merger deal and integration costs and a voluntary, advance contribution
              to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The reported revenue result for L3Harris was decreased $23 million for revenue generated by businesses divested in the fiscal transition period. The reported free cash flow result for Aviation
              Systems was increased $4.8 million for cash flow used for advance expense payments.

Although our Compensation Committee typically engages in pay differentiation in accordance with our pay-for-performance philosophy, the payouts shown above
                reflect no adjustments from the formulaic calculations of weighted payout percentages based on financial results against pre-determined targets (other than rounding up to the nearest thousand), which our Compensation Committee determined
                was appropriate for our abbreviated, 6-month fiscal transition period. The payouts under our Annual Incentive Plan for our fiscal transition period also are shown in the note to the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the Fiscal Transition Period

L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 49 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS FOR OUR SIX-MONTH FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD Long-Term Incentives The long-term incentives we granted to named executive officers in our fiscal transition period are summarized as follows: > Restricted stock units in respect of our annual cycle awards of long-term incentive compensation cycle: ■ granted only to certain executive officers—those employed with Harris at the time of the Merger who in accordance with Harris’ ordinary course annual compensation cycle
                          practices would have received equity-based awards in August 2019 (and as noted above, granted with target values at 50% of full-year values, reflecting the six-month duration of our fiscal transition period). ■ restricted stock units chosen based on their retention value; alignment with outstanding restricted stock units of L3Harris executive officers who were employed with L3 at the
                          time of the Merger granted to them by L3 in early calendar 2019 prior to the Merger in accordance with L3’s ordinary course annual compensation cycle practices and the terms of the Merger Agreement; and concurrence of FW Cook and
                          PM in support of their respective work for the Compensation Committees of L3 and Harris prior to the Merger. ■ 3-year cliff vesting. > Special, one-time integration-related awards consisting of performance share units and performance stock options designed to drive successful execution of the integration of L3
                          and Harris (a strategic objective following the Merger): ■ granted to all named executive officers. ■ mix of performance share units and performance stock options, chosen based on their value in motivating achievement of synergy targets and other financial performance that our
                          named executive officers can influence directly; their retention value; the terms of the employment arrangements with Messrs. Brown and Kubasik and alignment of incentives for other named executive officers; and concurrence of FW
                          Cook and PM in support of their respective work for the Compensation Committees of L3 and Harris prior to the Merger. ■ 3-year cliff vesting. For named executive officers employed with Harris at the time of the Merger, the Merger (which occurred at the very beginning of our fiscal transition period) also resulted in accelerated
              vesting and payouts of outstanding performance share unit awards and restricted stock unit awards as well as accelerated vesting of unvested stock options pursuant to the terms and conditions of those awards. (Double-trigger accelerated
              vesting on a change in control applies for equity awards granted after the Merger; single-trigger accelerated vesting on a change in control has been discontinued.) EQUITY-BASED AWARDS FOR FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD: TARGET VALUES AND MIX The table below shows the total target value of equity-based long-term incentive compensation in respect of our annual cycle awards for our fiscal transition period for the named executive
              officers employed with Harris at the time of the Merger (including a comparison with fiscal 2019). (As noted above, target values for our fiscal transition period were set at 50% of full-year values, reflecting the six-month duration of our
              fiscal transition period.) Annual Compensation Cycle Awards: Target Values for Certain Named Executive Officers (Fiscal Transition Period vs. Fiscal 2019) Fiscal 2019 Target Value Fiscal Transition Period Target Value % Change (on Full-Year Basis)* Reason for Change (on Full-Year Basis) Mr. Brown $ 8,800,000 $ 5,125,000 16 % Merit / market (larger company) Mr. Zoiss $ 1,050,000 $ 800,000 52 % Merit / market (larger business) * Calculated based on fiscal transition period target value at 100% of full-year value (as opposed to 50% of full-year value) for comparability with fiscal 2019 amount. > These target values were allocated 100% as restricted stock units. Although not in respect of our annual cycle awards, Mr. Malave also was granted an award of restricted stock units in our fiscal transition period, which was in connection with his hiring as
              our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to offset foregone equity compensation from his prior employer, had a target value of $950,000 and is subject to ratable vesting in equal portions over three years. 50 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS FOR OUR SIX-MONTH FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD Messrs. Kubasik and Gautier (who were employed with L3 at the time of the Merger) were not granted annual compensation cycle equity-based awards during our fiscal transition period, because
              L3 had granted them equity-based awards in early calendar 2019 prior to the Merger in accordance with L3’s ordinary course annual compensation cycle practices and the terms of the Merger Agreement. The table below shows the target values of the special, one-time integration-related equity-based long-term incentive compensation awards made during our fiscal transition period for each
              named executive officer. Special, One-Time Integration-Related Awards Made During Fiscal Transition Period: Target Values Total Target Value Performance Share Units Target Value Performance Stock Options Target Value Mr. Brown $ 7,500,000 $ 2,500,000 $ 5,000,000 Mr. Kubasik $ 7,500,000 $ 2,500,000 $ 5,000,000 Mr. Malave $ 2,000,000 $ 660,000 $ 1,340,000 Mr. Gautier $ 2,000,000 $ 660,000 $ 1,340,000 Mr. Zoiss $ 2,000,000 $ 660,000 $ 1,340,000 As reflected in the table, the total target values were allocated as follows: > 33% as performance share units > 67% as performance stock options METRICS FOR SPECIAL, ONE-TIME INTEGRATION-RELATED AWARDS The special, one-time integration-related performance share units and performance stock options are subject to cliff vesting and Merger synergy and other performance metrics summarized as
              follows: > The performance share units are subject to future vesting and adjustment based on an award payout formula that measures, as of December 31, 2021, L3Harris achievement relative
                          to a target level of $500 million for full-year run rate gross synergies from the Merger (with a minimum threshold set at 80% of target performance), with an upward or downward modifier for achievement relative to a target for
                          cumulative earnings per share. Actual payouts for the performance share units will be made in shares of L3Harris common stock and can range from 0% to 400% of the target number of performance share units granted (0% to 200% for
                          full-year run rate gross synergies performance relative to the $500 million target, with a 50% to 200% modifier for cumulative earnings per share performance relative to target). Vesting does not occur until June 29, 2022 and is
                          conditioned on the executive officer’s continuing employment with us through that date (with certain exceptions). > The performance stock options are subject to future vesting based on L3Harris achievement by December 31, 2021 of a threshold level for full-year run rate gross synergies from
                          the Merger. Vesting does not occur until June 29, 2022 and is conditioned on the executive officer’s continuing employment with us through that date (with certain exceptions). Our Board and Compensation Committee chose to use full-year run rate gross synergies and cumulative earnings per share as financial performance measures based on their business judgment
              that these measures would motivate elements of performance that executive officers could influence directly and that also would improve earnings per share over the long term and create long-term shareholder value.

              performance share units or performance stock options, and related terms and conditions, see the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Transition Period Table on page 65 and related notes.

              End Table on page 67 and related notes. FISCAL 2018-2020 CYCLE PSU AND FISCAL 2019-2021 CYCLE PSU AWARDS: ACCELERATED PAYOUTS MADE DURING FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD As noted above, the Merger closing (which occurred at the very beginning of our fiscal transition period) triggered accelerated vesting and payouts of both fiscal 2018-2020 cycle
              performance share unit awards (granted in fiscal 2018) and fiscal 2019-2021 cycle performance share unit awards (granted in fiscal 2019), pursuant to the terms and conditions of those awards. Although payouts of long-term incentive
              compensation awards normally are approved after our fiscal year has ended, the then-impending Merger necessitated changing this timing for fiscal 2019, and those payouts instead were approved by L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 51 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS the Harris Board and the Harris Compensation Committee on June 28, 2019, immediately before our fiscal 2019 ended and in advance of the Merger closing and the transition to
              the new L3Harris Board and L3Harris Compensation Committee (the memberships of which were reconstituted on the closing date in accordance with the Merger Agreement). For details on such approval in fiscal 2019 and payouts in our fiscal transition period, see the Compensation and Discussion Analysis—Executive Compensation Decisions For Fiscal
              2019—Long-Term Incentives discussion in our proxy statement for our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders filed with the SEC on September 10, 2019. These payouts are reflected in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal Transition Period
              Table on page 69 and related notes. CERTAIN RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND STOCK OPTIONS: ACCELERATED VESTING AND PAYOUTS DURING FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD As noted above, the Merger closing also resulted in accelerated vesting and payouts of then-outstanding restricted stock unit awards and accelerated vesting of then-unvested stock options,
              in both cases pursuant to the terms and conditions of those awards. For details on such vesting and payouts (which occurred in our fiscal transition period), see the Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal Transition Period Table on page
              69 and related notes. CERTAIN LEGACY L3 INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS: ACCELERATED VESTING AND PAYOUTS DURING FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD The Merger closing also resulted in accelerated vesting and payouts of cash amounts then-outstanding under legacy L3 multi- year performance cash and annual cash incentive plans, based on
              payout determinations made shortly before the Merger by the compensation committee of the board of directors of L3 after consultation with Harris. EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS Agreements With Mr. Brown Brown Original Agreement. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Brown that was entered into when
                he accepted the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of Harris in 2011 (the “Brown Original Agreement”). The Brown Original Agreement addresses, among other things, Mr. Brown’s compensation arrangements as well as payments and
                benefits to be provided to him if his employment is terminated by us without “cause” or by him as a result of a “constructive termination.” The Harris Compensation Committee and the independent directors of the Harris Board approved the
                Brown Original Agreement in the belief that it was critical to Mr. Brown’s decision to accept employment with Harris and would assist in his retention. In addition, it binds Mr. Brown to certain non-compete and non-solicitation undertakings
                that continue to have significant value to the company. In negotiating the compensation arrangements for Mr. Brown in the Brown Original Agreement, the Harris Compensation Committee received information, analysis and advice from its independent
              compensation consultant, independent legal counsel and a national executive search firm retained by the Harris Board’s CEO search committee. The Harris Compensation Committee and the Harris Board also considered the same executive
              compensation objectives and competitive positioning approach used for other executives and the substantial amount of long-term compensation that Mr. Brown forfeited to join Harris. As a result, Mr. Brown’s compensation arrangement addressed
              “ongoing” compensation and benefits as well as “transition” compensation. Elements of “ongoing” compensation and benefits provided under the Brown Original Agreement that continued in our fiscal transition period included: > base salary; > annual cash incentive opportunity under our Annual Incentive Plan; > eligibility for annual grants of equity-based long-term incentives; and > eligibility to participate in our retirement and employee welfare and benefit plans in accordance with their terms. Brown Letter Agreement. In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, we entered into an agreement with Mr. Brown
              addressing his employment following completion of the Merger (the “Brown Letter Agreement”). The Harris Compensation Committee and the independent directors of the Harris Board approved the Brown Letter Agreement in the belief that it would
              assist in retaining Mr. Brown’s valued service in connection with and after the Merger. The Brown Letter Agreement provides that: > Mr. Brown will serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of L3Harris through the second anniversary of the closing of the Merger (the “Initial Period”). For the one-year
                          period thereafter (the “Subsequent Period”), he will serve as Chairman of L3Harris. On the third anniversary of the closing of the Merger, he will retire as an officer and employee of L3Harris and will resign as a member of
                          L3Harris’ Board of Directors. 52 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS > During the Initial Period, Mr. Brown’s annual base salary is $1,450,000, his target annual cash bonus award is $2,500,000, the target value of his annual long-term incentive
                          awards is $10,250,000 and in no case will any such compensation element be less than that paid or granted to Mr. Kubasik. (The Board maintains discretion to increase these amounts.) > After the closing of the Merger, L3Harris would grant Mr. Brown a one-time integration-related award composed of performance share units with a target value of $2,500,000
                          (subject to certain performance-based multipliers) and performance-based non-qualified stock options with a grant date value of $5,000,000 and a ten-year term. Both components of the integration-related award will be subject to
                          three-year cliff vesting and will vest (if at all) subject to continued employment and achievement of performance conditions established by the L3Harris Compensation Committee. (This award was granted in August 2019 as described
                          above in this CD&A; for further information related to the terms and conditions, see the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Transition Period Table on page 65 and related notes.) > If during the Subsequent Period there is a qualifying termination of Mr. Brown (as defined in his Executive Change in Control Severance Agreement entered into with Harris), Mr.
                          Brown would be eligible for the compensation, benefits and other rights provided under that Executive Change in Control Severance Agreement, with such amounts determined using a “3X” multiple. In addition, his outstanding stock
                          options (other than those granted as part of the integration award) and restricted stock units would become fully vested and exercisable and payable (as applicable), and options would remain exercisable for their full remaining
                          term. Outstanding performance share units (other than those granted as part of the integration award) would remain outstanding and eligible to vest based on the attainment of performance goals. Mr. Brown would also receive benefit
                          continuation payments in lieu of providing in-kind medical and prescription drug coverage until he reaches the age of 65 (or, if earlier, the date he becomes eligible to receive comparable benefits from another employer).
                          Additionally, if such qualifying termination occurs in the Initial Period, the integration award would remain outstanding and eligible to vest as to a portion of the award based on the date of termination and attainment of
                          applicable performance goals. If such qualifying termination occurs during the Subsequent Period, the integration award would remain outstanding and eligible to vest based on the greater of target performance and the actual
                          attainment of applicable performance goals. The integration award options that vest would remain exercisable for their full term. > Upon his retirement at the end of the Subsequent Period, Mr. Brown will not receive any cash severance, but his equity awards (other than those comprising the integration award)
                          will be treated as described above regarding a qualifying termination, and his integration award will pay or vest, as applicable, based on actual performance. In addition, Mr. Brown will receive the benefit continuation payments
                          described above regarding a qualifying termination, and for 12 months following his retirement, have access to office space and administrative support provided by L3Harris. > Except as expressly modified by the Brown Letter Agreement, the terms of Mr. Brown’s pre-merger Executive Change in Control Severance Agreement with Harris and his 2011
                          employment agreement with Harris remain in full force and effect, including the restrictive covenants and confidentiality provisions of those agreements. For a summary of the payments and benefits to be provided to Mr. Brown if his employment is terminated, and a description of his Executive Change in Control Severance
              Agreement, see the “Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control” section beginning on page 72. Agreement With Mr. Kubasik In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, L3 and Mr. Kubasik, L3’s then-serving Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, entered into the Kubasik Letter Agreement,
              which addresses Mr. Kubasik’s employment following completion of the Merger. Pursuant to approval from the L3Harris Board, L3Harris assumed the Kubasik Letter Agreement following completion of the Merger and Mr. Kubasik’s appointment as Vice
              Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of L3Harris. The Kubasik Letter Agreement provides that: > Mr. Kubasik will serve as Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of L3Harris through the Initial Period. Upon the commencement of the Subsequent Period (or, if
                          earlier, the date that Mr. Brown ceases to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of L3Harris), Mr. Kubasik will become the Chief Executive Officer of L3Harris. On the third anniversary of the closing of the Merger, Mr. Kubasik will
                          also become Chairman of L3Harris. > During the Initial Period, Mr. Kubasik’s annual base salary is $1,450,000, his target annual cash bonus award is $2,500,000, the target value of his annual long-term incentive
                          awards is $10,250,000 and in no case will any such compensation element be less than that paid or granted to Mr. Brown. (The Board maintains discretion to increase these amounts.) > After the closing of the Merger, L3Harris would grant Mr. Kubasik a one-time integration-related award composed of performance share units with a target value of $2,500,000
                          (subject to certain performance-based multipliers) and performance-based non-qualified stock options with a grant date value of $5,000,000 and a ten-year term. Both components of the integration-related award will be subject to
                          three-year cliff vesting and will vest (if at all) subject to continued employment and achievement of performance conditions established by the L3Harris Compensation Committee. (This award was granted in August 2019 as described
                          above in this CD&A; for further information related to the terms and conditions, see the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Transition Period Table on page 65 and related notes.) L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 53 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS > In the event that L3Harris terminates him without “cause” or he terminates his employment for “good reason,” Mr. Kubasik’s outstanding stock options (other than those granted as
                          part of the integration award) and restricted stock units would become fully vested and exercisable and payable (as applicable), and options would remain exercisable for their full remaining term. Outstanding performance share
                          units (other than those granted as part of the integration award) would remain outstanding and eligible to vest based on the attainment of performance goals. Additionally, if such qualifying termination occurs in the Initial
                          Period, the integration award would remain outstanding and eligible to vest as to a portion of the award based on the date of termination and attainment of applicable performance goals. If such qualifying termination occurs during
                          the Subsequent Period, the integration award would remain outstanding and eligible to vest based on the greater of target performance and the actual attainment of applicable performance goals. The integration award options that
                          vest would remain exercisable for their full term. > The protection period under which Mr. Kubasik will be covered by L3’s Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Plan (the “L3 CIC Plan”) was extended until the fourth
                          anniversary of the closing of the Merger, in the event of his termination without “cause” or for “good reason” (each as defined in the L3 CIC Plan and modified in the Kubasik Letter Agreement). > The definition of “cause” under the L3 CIC Plan as applicable to Mr. Kubasik was modified to include an act of misconduct in violation of certain L3Harris policies or federal or
                          applicable state law regarding discrimination or sexual harassment of subordinate employees that creates a material risk of meaningful harm to L3Harris. > The definition of “good reason” under the L3 CIC Plan as applicable to Mr. Kubasik was modified to include the following events: failure to promote him to the contemplated new
                          roles upon and after the closing of the Merger; failure of Mr. Brown to cease providing services to L3Harris on or before the third anniversary of the closing of the Merger; or L3Harris’ material breach of the Kubasik Letter
                          Agreement. Mr. Kubasik also agreed to a limited waiver of his “good reason” rights related to his contemplated relocation to Florida, certain across-the-board changes in employee benefits and his transition to the role of Vice
                          Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer at the closing of the Merger. > Mr. Kubasik is eligible to receive an additional payment of up to $1,250,000 for relocation-related expenses, with gross up of amounts taxed as ordinary income. > Certain restrictive covenants and confidentiality provisions of the L3 CIC Plan apply as a condition to severance benefits under the L3 CIC Plan and
                          are extended to 24 months following termination of employment. For a summary of the payments and benefits to be provided to Mr. Kubasik if his employment is terminated, and a summary of the L3 CIC Plan terms applicable for him, see the “Potential
              Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control” section beginning on page 72. Agreement With Mr. Malave We have an employment letter agreement (the “Malave Letter Agreement”) with Mr. Malave pursuant to which he was appointed Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of L3Harris
              effective June 29, 2019 (the beginning of our fiscal transition period). The Malave Letter Agreement provides for the following compensation and benefits: > base salary at the annual rate of $625,000; > eligibility to receive an annual cash incentive under our Annual Incentive Plan with a target value of 100% of his base salary (with annual cash incentive payment for six-month
                          fiscal transition period equal to 50% of annual target); > commencing with calendar year 2020, eligibility to receive annual equity awards granted under our Equity Incentive Plan with a target value of $2,000,000; > a one-time restricted stock unit award under our Equity Incentive Plan with a grant date value of $950,000 and subject to ratable vesting over three years. (This award was
                          granted in August 2019; for further information related to the terms and conditions, see the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Transition Period Table on page 65 and related notes.); > a one-time momentum equity award under our Equity Incentive Plan consisting of performance share units with a target value of $660,000 and performance-based stock options with a
                          grant date value of $1,340,000 and a term of ten years, both subject to 3-year cliff vesting based on achievement relative to a specified level for full-year run rate gross synergies from the Merger. (This award was granted in
                          August 2019 and is summarized in the discussion of the special, one-time integration-related equity-based awards we granted in our fiscal transition period; for further information related to the terms and conditions, see the
                          Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Transition Period Table on page 65 and related notes.); > a one-time cash sign-on bonus of $200,000; > eligibility to participate in our retirement and employee health and welfare plans; and > certain relocation benefits, including a $10,000 “disruption payment” to cover miscellaneous expenses related to his relocation. 54 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OTHER COMPENSATION ELEMENTS The Malave Letter Agreement does not provide for a term of
              employment. However, if Mr. Malave’s employment is terminated within 36 months of his start date involuntarily by L3Harris other than for “cause” or voluntarily by Mr. Malave for “good reason” (as those terms are defined in his agreement),
              then, subject to his execution and delivery of a general release of claims against L3Harris, he would be entitled to receive a severance payment equal to his then-current annual base salary plus a pro rata annual cash bonus for the performance period in which the termination occurs, subject to
              achievement of the applicable performance goals through the end of such performance period. The restricted stock units granted to him in August 2019 also would become fully vested in the case of such termination. In addition, in the case of such termination on or following the future date of a “change in control” (as defined in his agreement), then, in lieu of the severance payments described in the
              preceding paragraph and subject to his execution and delivery of a general release of claims against L3Harris, he would be entitled to a severance payment equal to (a) two times the sum of his then-current annual base salary and target annual
              cash bonus and (b) a pro rata annual cash bonus for the performance period in which the termination occurs, subject to achievement of the applicable performance goals through the end of such performance period. For a summary of the payments and benefits to be provided to Mr. Malave if his employment is terminated, see the “Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control” section
              beginning on page 72. OTHER COMPENSATION ELEMENTS Health and Welfare Benefits We maintain health, welfare and other benefit programs for our U.S.-based employees, including medical and prescription coverage, dental and vision programs, short-term disability
              insurance, basic, supplemental and dependent life insurance, basic and supplemental accidental death and dismemberment insurance and business travel insurance, as well as paid time off, leave of absence and other similar policies. Our
              executive officers are eligible to participate in these programs on the same basis as many of our other salaried employees. We also provide liability insurance coverage to all Board-appointed officers, and our executive officers have the
              option to participate in a group excess liability umbrella policy at their own expense. We offer a long-term disability plan to many of our U.S.-based employees, including our named executive officers. The plan is fully insured and provides a benefit of 60% of eligible
              compensation before offsets for Social Security and certain other Company- or government-provided disability or other benefits. Eligible compensation for purposes of this plan is currently limited to $400,000 per year, and we provide a
              supplemental long-term disability benefit of 50% of eligible compensation above $400,000 and up to $800,000, for a maximum annual supplemental benefit of $200,000. Perquisites We provide only minimal executive perquisites. Board-elected or appointed officers are eligible for annual Company-paid physical examinations. We believe this practice is in the best
              interest of our Company because the health of an executive officer is critical to his or her performance. In addition, executives who were employed with L3 at the time of the Merger may continue to receive perquisites under legacy L3
              compensatory plans until such plans are modified. We do not provide tax reimbursement or gross-up payments with respect to any perquisites provided solely to executive officers. Tax gross-up payments pursuant to a plan, policy or arrangement
              applicable to a broad base of management employees, such as a relocation or tax equalization policy, are permitted. In consideration of the time demands on our CEO and COO and to minimize and more effectively utilize their travel time, our Compensation Committee has authorized limited personal use of
              Company-owned aircraft by our CEO and COO and their family members and guests. Limits on the number of hours are set by our Compensation Committee and reviewed annually. In our fiscal transition period, personal use of Company-owned aircraft
              by each of Mr. Brown and Mr. Kubasik was below the limits set by our Compensation Committee. Our CEO and COO are responsible for paying the tax on income imputed for such personal use of Company-owned aircraft. In very limited instances as
              approved by our CEO, we also may provide limited personal use of Company-owned aircraft for other executives. Perquisites provided in our fiscal transition period represent a small portion of the total compensation of the applicable named executive officer. The dollar values ascribed to these
              perquisites are shown in the Fiscal Transition Period Summary Compensation Table on page 62 under the “All Other Compensation” column and related notes. Starting in 2020, our Board-elected or appointed officers are eligible to receive Company-paid financial planning and advice and state tax preparation services from a designated third-party
              provider, but are responsible for paying the tax on income imputed L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 55 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OTHER COMPENSATION ELEMENTS for such
                services if they elect to receive them. (Messrs. Kubasik and Gautier were eligible for these services in our fiscal transition period pursuant to legacy L3 compensatory plans that remained operative.) Retirement Programs TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS We maintain the L3Harris Retirement Savings Plan (our “RSP”), which is a tax-qualified, 401(k) defined contribution retirement plan available to most of our U.S.-based employees, including
              our named executive officers. Subject to applicable limits under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), participants may generally contribute up to 70% of eligible compensation. In general, after one year
              of service we will make a matching contribution of up to 6% of eligible compensation that is contributed by a participant. During our fiscal transition period, we also maintained an analogous legacy L3 tax-qualified, 401(k) defined
              contribution retirement plan (the “L3 401(k) Plan”) available to most U.S.-based employees who were employees of L3 at the time of the Merger. The assets of the L3 401(k) Plan plan were combined into the trust for our RSP effective December
              31, 2019, and the participants in the plan became eligible to participate in our RSP effective January 1, 2020. NON-QUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLANS To the extent contributions by participants to our RSP are subject to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code, certain of our salaried employees, including our named executive
              officers, may elect to participate in our Excess Retirement Savings Plan (“ERSP”), which is an unfunded, non-qualified defined contribution plan. In addition, our Compensation Committee has discretion to provide for the deferral of other
              compensation under our ERSP, including equity awards. During our fiscal transition period, we also maintained an analogous legacy L3 unfunded, non-qualified defined contribution plan (the “SSP-II”) available to certain salaried employees who
              were employees of L3 at the time of the Merger. The participants in the SSP-II became eligible to participate in our ERSP effective January 1, 2020, at which time no further contributions were permitted in the SSP-II. The value of our contributions credited to our named executive officers’ accounts under our RSP and ERSP (or under the L3 401(k) Plan or the SSP-II) is shown in the Fiscal Transition Period
              Summary Compensation Table on page 62 under the “All Other Compensation” column and related notes. Additional information regarding our ERSP and credits to accounts under our ERSP or the SSP-II is shown in the “Nonqualified Deferred
              Compensation” section of this proxy statement beginning on page 70. In addition, Mr. Gautier was a participant under the L3 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, a non-qualified, unfunded, defined benefit pension plan, which we
              maintained following the Merger and from which he received during our fiscal transition period an accelerated payout triggered by the change in control under the plan as a result of the Merger. Effective January 1, 2020, Mr. Gautier (and
              other plan participants) became ineligible to receive continued service credits under the plan and became eligible to participate only in our RSP and ERSP. Additional information regarding the plan and Mr. Gautier’s payout is set forth in the
              “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation” section of this proxy statement beginning on page 70. Severance Arrangements As a general matter, most of our employees are “employees at-will.” Messrs. Brown, Kubasik and Malave are our only named executive officers with a contract that would require us to pay cash
              severance upon termination of employment other than in connection with a change in control. These payments are governed by their respective employment agreements, discussed beginning on page 72. Although Messrs. Gautier and Zoiss did not have severance agreements during our fiscal transition period other than in connection with a change in control (see related discussion below), we
              had a long-standing practice of providing reasonable severance compensation for terminating an executive’s employment without cause, based on relevant factors such as the reason for termination and length of the executive’s employment. In
              February 2020, we adopted the new L3Harris Severance Pay Plan, which provides severance benefits to a full-time regular employee (including an executive) if the employee is terminated due to an involuntary or voluntary reduction-in-force. The
              terms of the new plan do not apply for executives who have operative severance arrangements pursuant to a separate contract. A description of the contractual benefits to each of Messrs. Brown, Kubasik and Malave in the event of his termination can be found in the “Potential Payments Upon
              Termination or a Change in Control” section of this proxy statement beginning on page 72. 56 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OTHER COMPENSATION POLICIES Change in Control Severance Arrangements Prior to the Merger, Harris had entered into change in control severance agreements with its Board-elected or appointed officers, including those named executive officers of L3Harris who were employed with
              Harris at the time of the Merger (Messrs. Brown and Zoiss), and L3 had adopted the L3 CIC Plan covering its executive officers and other corporate employees, including Messrs. Kubasik and Gautier. The Harris Board and the L3 Board,
              respectively, believed that these arrangements would maintain alignment of the interests of individuals covered by the arrangements and shareholders during the period of an actual or rumored change in control and were necessary in some cases
              to attract and retain executives and that these arrangements would facilitate objective assessment of potential transactions that may be in our shareholders’ best interests but could negatively impact the covered individual’s future
              employment. Under these arrangements, severance benefits would be provided to a covered individual if the covered individual is terminated without “cause” or resigns for “good reason” (such as a material adverse change in compensation or job
              responsibilities) within two years following a change in control. A “double trigger” was included in these arrangements so that benefits would be provided only if there is both a change in control and a termination of employment. These change in control severance arrangements do not provide for gross-ups for excise taxes that may be imposed by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on payouts made to a covered
            individual. The arrangements do provide for a “best net after-tax” payment approach that reduces payments and benefits if the reduction would result in the covered individual receiving higher payments and benefits on a net after-tax basis. The change in control severance arrangements with Mr. Malave are pursuant to the Malave Letter Agreement, and those arrangements are described above in the “Agreement with
            Mr. Malave” discussion of this CD&A. A description of the material terms of the change in control severance agreements for Messrs. Brown and Zoiss and of the L3 CIC Plan applicable for Messrs. Kubasik and
            Gautier, as well as a summary of potential payments upon termination or a change in control for our named executive officers, can be found in the “Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control” section of this proxy statement
            beginning on page 72. This includes a discussion of how annual cash incentive awards and equity awards are treated upon a change in control. The Merger constituted a change in control transaction under the change in control severance arrangements described above, which are still operative for applicable covered individuals,
            including our named executive officers who were employed with L3 or Harris at the time of the Merger. In February 2020, we adopted the new L3Harris Executive Change in Control Severance Plan, which provides severance benefits to executive
            officers and certain other executives (excluding our CEO and COO) if the executive is terminated without “cause” or resigns for “good reason” (such as a material adverse change in compensation or job responsibilities or location) within two
            years following a change in control. The plan includes a “double trigger” so that we would provide benefits only if there is both a change in control and a termination of employment. The plan does not provide for gross-ups for excise taxes that
            may be imposed by the IRS on payouts made to an executive, but does provide for a “best net after-tax” payment approach that reduces payments and benefits to an executive if the reduction would result in the executive receiving higher payments
            and benefits on a net after-tax basis. The terms of the new plan do not apply for our CEO and COO and also do not apply for individuals covered by the change in control severance arrangements described above until after the expiration of the
            applicable change in control severance arrangements described above. The plan is designed to preserve the focus and productivity of our executives, avoid disruption and prevent attrition during a period of uncertainty. Our Board believes that
            the plan will align the interests of our executives and shareholders during the period of an actual or rumored change in control and is necessary in some cases to attract and retain executives. Our Board also believes that the plan will
            facilitate objective assessment of potential transactions that may be in our shareholders’ best interests but could negatively impact an executive’s future employment. OTHER COMPENSATION POLICIES Recovery of Executive Compensation (“Clawback”) Our executive compensation program permits us to recover all or a
              portion of any performance-based compensation, whether cash or equity, if our financial statements are restated as a result of errors, omissions or fraud. The amount that may be recovered would be the amount by which the affected compensation
              exceeded the amount that would have been payable had the financial statements been initially filed as restated, or any greater or lesser amount that our Compensation Committee or the independent members of our Board shall determine. The
              amount that may be recovered, however, may not be less than the amount required to be repaid or recovered as a matter of law. Recovery of such amounts by us would be in addition to any actions imposed by law, enforcement agencies, regulators
              or other authorities.

              Risk” section of this proxy statement beginning on page 61. Stock Ownership Guidelines To further promote management’s ownership of our shares and more closely align management and shareholder interests, our Compensation Committee has established the
            following stock ownership guidelines for our Board-elected or appointed officers. Stock Ownership (as a multiple of base salary) CEO 6x President and COO 6x Other Senior corporate officers & segment Presidents (including the other named executive officers) 3x Other corporate officers 2x Base Salary What counts: Shares owned outright or jointly by the executive, shares credited under any retirement plan sponsored by us, share equivalents represented by
            amounts deferred in the L3Harris Stock Fund account of our ERSP, and restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards (on an after-tax basis). What doesn’t count: Stock options, including performance stock options, and unearned performance share units. Executives are expected to meet these ownership levels by the end of the five-year period from their date of hire or promotion into a position covered by the guidelines. Our Compensation
            Committee conducts an annual review to assess compliance with the guidelines. As of February 28, 2020, our named executive officers met or were on track to meet the applicable stock ownership guidelines within the applicable timeframe. Executive officers are not permitted to sell our shares (other than the sale of shares to pay the exercise price and related taxes upon the exercise of stock options)
            until they have satisfied the applicable guidelines. Executives age 62 or older are not subject to the guidelines. No Repricing of Options We have not repriced options, nor have we replaced options if our stock price declined after the grant date. The exercise price of stock options is the closing market
            price of our common stock on the grant date (or on the prior business day if the grant is made on a weekend or holiday). Our Compensation Committee and Board, however, also have discretion to set the exercise price of stock options higher than
            the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date. Equity Grants by CEO As permitted under our equity incentive plans, our Board has delegated to our CEO the authority to grant equity awards to employees who are not executive officers. Such
            grants are subject to our equity grant policy. The annual maximum number of shares underlying the awards that may be granted pursuant to this delegation is set by our Compensation Committee, which reviews these awards annually. Insider Trading Policy and Policy against Hedging and Pledging Our insider trading policy prohibits directors, employees and certain of their family members from purchasing or selling any type of security (whether issued by us or
            another company) while such person is aware of material non-public information about the issuer of the security (except pursuant to an approved 10b-5 trading plan), or from providing such material non-public information to any person who may
            trade while aware of such information. This policy also prohibits directors and employees from engaging in short sales with respect to our securities and from entering into hedging, puts, calls or other derivative 58 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OTHER COMPENSATION POLICIES transactions with respect to our securities. Our
            policies also prohibit directors and executives from purchasing our stock on margin, holding our stock in a margin account or otherwise pledging our stock as collateral for margin accounts, loans or any other purpose. We do permit the use of
            “cashless exercise” procedures to exercise stock options granted by us if such exercise complies with our insider trading and other relevant policies. None of our directors or executive officers pledged our stock during our fiscal transition
            period. We also have procedures that require trades by directors and executive officers to be pre-cleared by our General Counsel or his staff. Tax and Accounting Considerations TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally prohibits a public company from deducting compensation paid in any year in excess of $1 million to its CEO or any of its four other most
            highly compensated executive officers as of the end of the year. In the past, certain compensation was specifically exempt from the deduction limit to the extent it was “performance-based” under Section 162(m). In evaluating whether to
            structure executive compensation components as performance-based and thus exempt from the deduction limit, our Compensation Committee considered the net cost to us and its ability to effectively administer executive compensation in the
            long-term interest of shareholders. Our Compensation Committee believed that it was important to preserve flexibility in administering compensation programs in a manner designed to promote corporate goals. Accordingly, our Compensation
            Committee retained the flexibility to approve elements of compensation that it believed were consistent with the objectives of our executive compensation program, but that may not have been fully deductible. For example, sign-on bonuses and
            time-based restricted stock or restricted stock units granted without performance conditions were not performance-based under Section 162(m) and, in certain instances, deductibility of such compensation may have been limited. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code was amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the amended law
            eliminated the Section 162(m) exception for performance-based compensation (other than with respect to payments made pursuant to certain “grandfathered” arrangements entered into prior to November 2, 2017) and expanded the definition of
            “covered employee” to include a company’s chief financial officer and any individual who was a covered employee of us in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016. As a result of the changes to Section 162(m), our Compensation
            Committee anticipates that the portion of future compensation paid to our named executive officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible. Our Compensation Committee believes that our interests are best served by maintaining flexibility
            in the way compensation is provided, even if it might result in the non-deductibility of certain compensation under the Internal Revenue Code. NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION Under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, “nonqualified deferred compensation” must be deferred and paid under plans or arrangements that satisfy certain
            requirements with respect to the timing of deferral elections, timing of payments and certain other matters. If these requirements are not complied with, amounts deferred under compensation arrangements that are subject to Section 409A will be
            currently includable in income to the employee and subject to an excise tax to be assessed on the employee. In general, it is our intention to design and administer our compensation and benefits plans and arrangements for all of our employees
            so that they either are exempt from, or satisfy the requirements of, Section 409A. ACCOUNTING FOR EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Before we grant equity-based compensation awards, we consider the accounting impact of the award. This involves analyzing the award’s impact both as structured and in other
            possible scenarios. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 59 Table of Contents COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The following Report of our Compensation Committee does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other
            previous or future filings by us under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate this Report by reference therein. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this proxy statement. Based on its review and
            discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors of L3Harris Technologies, Inc., and the Board of Directors of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. has approved, that this Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included
            in this proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and incorporated by reference in L3Harris Technologies, Inc.’s Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the fiscal transition period ended January 3, 2020. Submitted on March 6, 2020 by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. Lewis Hay III, Chairperson Thomas A. Dattilo Lewis Kramer Rita S. Lane 60 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPENSATION PLANS AND RISK In fiscal 2017, the Harris Compensation Committee and management, with the assistance of Aon Hewitt Associates LLC, conducted a review of Harris’ compensation strategies, plans, programs,
            policies and practices, including executive compensation and major broad-based compensation programs in which salaried and hourly employees at various levels of the organization participate. The goal of this review was to assess whether any of
            Harris’ compensation strategies, plans, programs, policies or practices, either individually or in the aggregate, would encourage executives or employees to undertake unnecessary or excessive risks that were reasonably likely to have a material
            adverse impact on Harris. The review included variable pay, sales commission and other compensation plans and considered the number of participants in each plan, the participants’ levels within the
            organization, the target and maximum payment potential and the performance criteria under each plan, and the type of plan. Management and the Harris Compensation Committee also applied a risk assessment to those plans that were identified as
            having the potential to deliver a material amount of compensation, which included the annual incentive and long-term compensation plans that are described in the CD&A section of this proxy statement. Based on the review, management and the
            Harris Compensation Committee concluded that Harris’ compensation strategies, plans, programs, policies and practices did not pose material risk due to a variety of mitigating factors. These factors included: > An emphasis on long-term compensation that utilizes a balanced portfolio of compensation elements, such as cash and equity, and delivers rewards based on sustained performance
                        over time; > The Compensation Committee’s power to set short-and long-term performance objectives for incentive plans, which appropriately correlated with shareholder value and which use
                        multiple financial metrics to measure performance; > Performance share unit awards that generally are tied to financial performance measures spanning overlapping three-year performance periods, creating a focus on driving sustained
                        performance over multiple performance periods, which mitigates the potential for executives to take excessive risks to drive one-time, short-term performance spikes in any one performance period; > The use of equity awards with vesting periods to foster retention and align executives’ interests with those of shareholders; > Capping potential payouts under both short-and long-term incentive plans to eliminate the potential for any windfalls; > A “clawback” policy that allows recovery of all or a portion of any performance-based compensation if financial statements are restated as a result of errors, omissions or fraud; > Share ownership guidelines; and > A broad array of competitive benefit programs that offer employees and executives an opportunity to build meaningful retirement assets and benefit protections throughout their
                        careers. Our compensation strategy, plans, programs, policies and practices did not materially change from those of Harris prior to the Merger, and we did
                  not materially change them in our fiscal transition period. As a result, both management and our Compensation Committee have again concluded that our compensation strategies, plans, programs, policies and practices are not reasonably
                  likely to have a material adverse effect on us.

                                                        granted in our fiscal transition period were determined as of the grant date using the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date. The grant date fair values of performance share units
                                                        granted prior to our fiscal transition period were calculated based on a multifactor Monte Carlo valuation model that simulates our stock price and TSR relative to companies in the S&P 500, less a
                                                        discount because dividends are not payable on performance share units during the performance period. Although dividends also are not payable during the performance period of the special, one-time
                                                        integration-related performance share units granted in our fiscal transition period, the grant date fair values of those performance share units do not reflect any discounts. The grant date fair
                                                        values of restricted stock units were determined as of the grant date using the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date. Although dividends also are not payable during the

                                                        stock units do not reflect any discounts. Pursuant to SEC rules, we disregarded the estimates of forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions. As noted, the grant date fair values of performance share units granted prior to our fiscal transition period reflect discounts
                                                      (because dividends are not payable on performance share units during the performance period), which were approximately: (a) $8.54 per share for fiscal 2019 performance share units granted in August
                                                      2018; (b) $7.18 per share for fiscal 2018 performance share units granted in August 2017; and (c) $6.68 per share for fiscal 2017 performance share units granted in August 2016. For all grants of
                                                      performance share units, each performance share unit earned at the end of the applicable multi-year performance period and paid out receives accrued dividend equivalents in an amount equal to the cash
                                                      dividends or other distributions, if any, which are paid with respect to an issued and outstanding share of our common stock during the performance period. Payment of such dividend equivalents is made
                                                      in cash at the time of the actual payout of performance share units ultimately earned as determined after completion of the performance period. Dividends declared with respect to issued and outstanding
                                                      shares of our common stock were $1.50, $2.74, $2.28 and $2.12 per share in our fiscal transition period and fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The dollar value of dividend equivalents on vested

                                                        necessarily correspond to the actual values that may be realized by our named executive officers. The grant date fair values of these option grants were calculated as of the grant date using the
                                                        Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The grant date fair values per share of our common stock underlying these option grants were as follows: (a) $38.61 for fiscal transition period performance
                                                        stock option grants in August 2019; (b) $30.05 for fiscal 2019 stock option grants in August 2018; (c) $18.59 for fiscal 2018 stock option grants in August 2017; and (d) $13.82 for fiscal 2017 stock

                                                        transition period (Note 16) and in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 (Note 15), 2018 (Note 14) or 2017 (Note 15), respectively. The grant date fair values of performance stock options
                                                        were computed based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions as of the grant date of the performance stock options, which was at target, and also represents the maximum number of shares
                                                        underlying the performance stock option award. Pursuant to SEC rules, we disregarded the estimates of forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions. See the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in

                                                          Messrs. Kubasik and Gautier, the dollar value of premiums paid by us for executive life insurance and executive medical reimbursement under legacy L3 health and welfare plans that continued during
                                                          our fiscal transition period (but which are no longer provided effective January 1, 2020). (b) Reflects our contributions credited to accounts of our named executive officers under our RSP or the L3 401(k) Plan, are tax-qualified, defined
                                                      contribution plans. (c) Reflects our credits to accounts of our named executive officers under our ERSP or the SSP-II, which are unfunded, nonqualified defined contribution

                                                        use of Company-owned aircraft. The amount for Mr. Kubasik consisted of $72,716 for personal use of Company-owned aircraft; $208,720 for relocation, commuting and related temporary living expenses and
                                                        allowances; and $11,971 for Company-paid financial planning and advice and federal and state tax preparation services from a designated third-party provider, including imputed income for such services
                                                        (but no gross-up for payment of taxes for such imputed income). The amount for Mr. Malave was for payment or reimbursement of relocation, commuting and related temporary living expenses and
                                                        allowances. The amount for Mr. Gautier was for Company-paid financial planning and advice and federal and state tax preparation services from a designated third-party provider, including imputed
                                                        income for such services (but no gross-up for payment of taxes for such imputed income). The amount for Mr. Zoiss was $0. The incremental cost to us of personal use of Company-owned aircraft is calculated based on our average variable operating costs, which
                                                    include fuel, maintenance, weather-monitoring, on-board catering, trip-related hangar/parking, landing/ramp fees and other miscellaneous variable costs. Our total annual variable operating costs are
                                                    divided by the annual number of miles the Company-owned aircraft flew to derive an average variable cost per mile, which is then multiplied by the miles flown for personal use to derive the incremental
                                                    cost. The methodology excludes fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as pilots’ and other employees’ salaries, purchase costs of the aircraft and non-trip related hangar expenses. The
                                                    taxable benefit associated with personal use of Company-owned aircraft is imputed at “Standard Industry Level” rates to the applicable named executive officers, who do not receive any gross-up for payment
                                                    of taxes for such imputed income. The amount related to the loss of tax deduction to us due to the personal use of Company-owned aircraft under the Internal Revenue Code is not included. As noted above, we also offer a supplemental long-term disability benefit to employees with eligible compensation in excess of $400,000 and offer our
                                                    executives the option to participate in a group excess liability umbrella policy. No premiums are payable by us for these benefits and there is no incremental cost reflected for our named executive
                                                    officers. Certain Company-related events may include meetings and receptions with our customers, executive management or Board attended by the
                                                    named executive officer and a spouse or guest. If the Company-owned aircraft is used and a spouse or guest travels with the named executive officer, no amounts are included because there is no incremental
                                                    cost to us. We also have Company-purchased tickets to athletic or other events generally for business purposes. In limited instances, executives, including our named executive officers, may have personal
                                                    use of Company-purchased event tickets. No amounts are included because there is no incremental cost to us of such personal use. For a discussion of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to our
                                                    named executive officers, see the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this proxy statement. (e) Reflects the dollar value of dividend equivalents paid in cash to our named executive officers with respect to performance share units and restricted
                                                      stock units, which vested at the time of the Merger. The value of such dividend equivalents was not factored into the grant date fair value of the underlying performance share units and restricted stock
                                                      units. (f) Reflects payouts to Messrs. Kubasik and Gautier of cash amounts under legacy L3 multi-year performance cash and annual cash incentive plans as a result
                                                      of the change in control due to the Merger, based on payout determinations made shortly before the Merger by the compensation committee of the board of directors of L3 after consultation with Harris.
                                                      For Mr. Gautier, also reflects his cash distribution under the legacy L3 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, a non-qualified, unfunded, defined benefit pension plan, as a result of the change in
                                                      control due to the Merger. (8) Mr. Kubasik was employed with L3 at the time of the Merger and was not a named executive officer of L3Harris prior to the fiscal transition period. (9) Mr. Malave joined L3Harris on June 29, 2019 and was not a named executive officer of L3Harris prior to the fiscal transition period.

                                                      reflect the grant date fair value without reduction for estimates of forfeitures related to service- based vesting conditions. The grant date fair values of these performance share units were computed based on the probable
                                                    outcome of the performance conditions as of the grant date of such awards (which was at target) and were determined as of the grant date using the $204.85 closing market price of our common stock on the
                                                    grant date. The grant date fair values of these performance stock options were calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton
                                                    option-pricing model and were computed based on the probable outcome of the performance vesting condition as of the grant date of the performance stock options (which was at target). The grant date fair
                                                    value per share of our common stock underlying these performance stock options was $38.61. The grant date fair values of restricted stock units were determined as of the grant date using the $204.85 closing market price of our
                                                    common stock on the grant date. The assumptions used for the valuations are set forth in Note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements in our Transition

                                                      $210.47 closing market price per share of our common stock on January 3, 2020, the last trading day of our fiscal transition period. (5) These are performance share units granted as part of the special, one-time integration-related awards in our fiscal transition period. The numbers of
                                                    performance share units and related values as of January 3, 2020 represent the maximum possible payouts of the performance share units (400% of target), rather than payouts at target, in accordance with
                                                    SEC rules requiring reporting of these amounts in this manner because our performance exceeded target during the last completed fiscal year or years over which performance is measured. Actual performance
                                                    will cause the number of shares that are earned to range from 0% to a maximum of 400% of the target number of performance share units based on an award payout formula of 0% to 200% for L3Harris
                                                    achievement, as of December 31, 2021, relative to a target level of $500 million for full-year run rate gross synergies from the Merger (with a minimum threshold set at 80% of target performance), with a
                                                    50% to 200% modifier (i.e., downward or upward) for L3Harris achievement, as of December 31, 2021, relative to a target for cumulative earnings per share. Cash dividend equivalents are not payable during
                                                    the performance period on performance share units, and instead, each performance share unit earned and paid out receives accrued dividend equivalents in an amount per share equal to the cash dividends or
                                                    other distributions, if any, paid with respect to an issued and outstanding share of our common stock during the performance period, with payment of such dividend equivalents to be made in cash at the
                                                    time of the actual payout of performance share units ultimately earned as determined after completion of the performance period. For these performance share units, an executive officer must remain
                                                    employed with us through June 29, 2022 to earn an award. See the “Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control” section of this proxy statement beginning on page 72 for the treatment of
                                                    these performance share units upon a termination of employment or change in control. 68 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION TABLES OPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED IN FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD TABLE For more information regarding performance share units, see the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Transition Period Table on page 65 and related

OPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED IN FISCAL TRANSITION PERIOD TABLE The following table provides information for each of our named executive officers regarding (1) stock option exercises during our fiscal transition period,
                                          including the number of shares acquired and value realized on exercise, and (2) vesting of stock awards during or in respect of our fiscal transition period, including the number of shares acquired and value

(2) Unless otherwise specified in the notes below, consists of shares earned and acquired on vesting upon completion of the Merger on June 29, 2019 (the
                                                      beginning of our fiscal transition period) of performance share unit awards (including L3 performance share unit awards) and shares acquired on vesting upon completion of the Merger on June 29, 2019 of
                                                      restricted stock unit awards (including L3 restricted stock unit awards), with value realized on vesting of those performance share unit and restricted stock unit awards determined by multiplying the
                                                      number of shares acquired on vesting by the $189.13 closing market price of our common stock on June 28, 2019, the last trading day prior to the day of vesting, as described further in the notes below.
                                                      Upon the vesting and release of performance share unit and restricted stock unit awards, shares are surrendered to satisfy income tax withholding requirements. Amounts shown for number of shares
                                                      acquired and value realized on vesting, however, have not been reduced to reflect shares surrendered to cover such tax withholding obligations. With respect to performance share unit awards granted by
                                                      Harris prior to the Merger, as noted elsewhere, the Merger closing on June 29, 2019 triggered accelerated vesting and payouts of performance share unit awards for the fiscal 2018-2020 and fiscal
                                                      2019-2021 performance period award cycles. In anticipation of the closing, payouts in respect of those awards were therefore determined and approved on June 28, 2019, and the number of shares earned and
                                                      acquired on vesting in respect of those awards for the: (a) fiscal 2018-2020 performance period award cycle, as a percentage of the target number of units under those awards as granted in fiscal 2018,
                                                      was 171.2%; and (b) fiscal 2019-2021 performance period award cycle, as a percentage of the target number of units under those awards as granted in fiscal 2019, was 169.6%. For additional information
                                                      with respect to payouts in respect of performance share unit awards for the fiscal 2018-2020 and fiscal 2019-2021 performance period award cycles, see the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section

L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 69 Table of Contents COMPENSATION TABLES NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION Retirement Savings Plan Our RSP is a tax-qualified, 401(k) defined contribution retirement plan available to most of our U.S.-based employees, including our named executive officers.
                                          Under our RSP, subject to applicable limits under the Internal Revenue Code, participants generally may contribute up to 70% of eligible compensation, the most significant components of which are base salary and
                                          annual incentive payments. In general, following one year of service, we match up to the first 6% of eligible compensation that is contributed by a participant. The Internal Revenue Code limits certain
                                          contributions to a participant’s RSP account and also limits the amount of compensation that may be considered when determining benefits under our RSP. Participants in our RSP are immediately vested in contributions they make and are fully vested in the remainder of their account (including contributions we make) upon termination
                                          of employment on or after the attainment of age 55 or due to their disability or death. In general, participants also become fully vested in the remainder of their account after three years of employment with us
                                          (contributions we make generally are subject to three-year graduated vesting). During our fiscal transition period, we also maintained the L3 401(k) Plan, an analogous legacy L3 tax-qualified, 401(k) defined contribution retirement plan available to most U.S.-based employees who were
                                          employees of L3 at the time of the Merger. The assets of the L3 401(k) Plan were combined into the trust for our RSP effective December 31, 2019, and the participants in the plan became eligible to participate in
                                          our RSP effective January 1, 2020. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans To the extent contributions by participants to our RSP are limited by the Internal Revenue Code, certain of our
                                            salaried employees, including our named executive officers, are eligible to participate in our ERSP. The ERSP is an unfunded, nonqualified defined contribution retirement plan intended to make up the difference
                                            between the amount actually credited to a participant’s account under our RSP and the amount that, in the absence of certain Internal Revenue Code limits, would have been
                                            credited to the participant’s account. In addition, our Compensation Committee may, at its discretion, provide for the deferral of other compensation to executive officers under our
                                          ERSP, including equity awards. During our fiscal transition period, we also maintained the SSP-II, an analogous legacy L3 unfunded, non-qualified defined contribution plan available to certain salaried employees who were employees of L3 at the
                                        time of the Merger. The participants in the SSP-II became eligible to participate in our ERSP effective January 1, 2020, at which time no further contributions were permitted in the SSP-II. The value of our contributions credited to our named executive officers’ accounts under our RSP and ERSP (or under the L3 401(k) Plan or the SSP-II) is shown in the Fiscal Transition Period Summary Compensation
                                          Table on page 62 under the “All Other Compensation” column and related notes. In addition, Mr. Gautier was a participant under the L3 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, a non-qualified, unfunded, defined benefit pension plan, which we maintained
                                          following the Merger and from which he received during our fiscal transition period an accelerated payout triggered by the change in control under the plan as a result of the Merger. Effective January 1, 2020, Mr.
                                          Gautier (and other plan participants) became ineligible to receive continued service credits under the plan and became eligible to participate only in our RSP and ERSP. Deferred compensation under our ERSP or the SSP-II generally will be paid or commence being paid to a participant in January of the calendar year
                                          following the year in which such participant reaches age 55 or the year in which such participant’s employment terminates, whichever is later. Participants select the form in which payment will be made, typically a
                                          lump sum or annual payments over a period of 3, 5, 7, 10 or 15 years. Deferred amounts generally may not be withdrawn prior to their payment date, except to meet an “unforeseeable financial emergency,” as defined
                                          under U.S. Federal tax law, or in the event of a change in control of the Company that satisfies certain requirements of U.S. Federal tax law. Payments to “specified employees,” as defined under U.S. Federal tax
                                          law, are delayed at least six months after termination of employment (this six-month delay generally does not apply to amounts deferred prior to 2005). The vesting provisions of our ERSP are generally the same as the vesting provisions of our RSP. Participants in our ERSP are immediately vested in contributions they make and are fully vested in the remainder
                                            of their account upon termination of employment on or after the attainment of age 55 or due to their disability or death. Participants also generally become fully 70 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION TABLES NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION vested in the remainder of their account after three years of employment with us (contributions we make generally are subject to
                                          three-year graduated vesting). Earnings on amounts credited to a participant’s account in our ERSP or the SSP-II are based on participant selections among investment choices,
                                          which substantially mirror the investment choices available under our RSP. Participants may elect that a portion of their account be deemed invested in the Company stock fund, and such amounts are credited with
                                          dividend equivalents equal to the dividends paid on our common stock, which are then deemed reinvested in the Company stock fund. No above-market or preferential earnings are paid or guaranteed on investment
                                          choices. Amounts credited to a participant’s account in our ERSP or the SSP-II may be partially or fully funded by a grantor trust, also known as a “rabbi
                                          trust,” and are required to be fully funded upon a change in control of the Company. The assets in such trust are subject to the claims of our creditors, and participants are treated as our unsecured general
                                          creditors. Amounts credited to our named executive officers’ accounts in our ERSP or the SSP-II as of the end of fiscal 2019 were paid out to such named executive officers following the Merger, which constituted a
                                          change in control pursuant to the terms and conditions of our ERSP and the SSP-II (with the rabbi trust funding requirement waived by participants).

                                            employment of such named executive officer. Potential Termination Payments Under Brown Employment Agreements In October 2011, our Board approved, and Harris and Mr. Brown entered into, the Brown Original Agreement providing for Mr. Brown’s employment as our Chief
                                            Executive Officer and President. In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, we and Mr. Brown, on October 12, 2018, entered into the Brown Letter Agreement addressing Mr. Brown’s employment following
                                            completion of the Merger. The Brown Original Agreement provided for an initial employment term that commenced on November 1, 2011 and ended on October 31, 2016, and as of November 1, 2016, the employment term
                                            automatically extended for successive one-year periods unless we or Mr. Brown provide prior written notice that the employment term would not be so extended. Under the Brown Original Agreement, we agreed to

Under the Brown Original Agreement, “cause” generally means: > A substantial and continual failure or refusal by him to perform his material duties under his employment agreement (other than any failure
                                                            resulting from illness or disability); > A willful breach by him of any material provision of his employment agreement; > Any reckless or willful misconduct (including action or failures to act) by him that causes material harm to our business or reputation; > Any unexcused, repeated or prolonged absence from work by him (other than as a result of, or in connection with, sickness, injury or

                                                            similar manner and proportion to our other senior executive officers; > Our removal of him from his position as Chief Executive Officer or President (The Brown Letter Agreement providing for Mr. Brown’s role as
                                                            Chairman and CEO following the Merger constituted Mr. Brown’s consent to removal of him as President.); > Our assignment to him of duties or responsibilities that are materially inconsistent with his positions with us; > Any requirement by us that he relocate his principal place of employment to a location other than our principal headquarters; > Our failure to nominate him for reelection to our Board upon expiration of his term at any annual meeting of our shareholders during the term
                                                            of his employment; > Our failure to obtain an assumption of his employment agreement by a successor of the Company; > Our delivery of a notice not to renew his employment term pursuant to his employment agreement; or > Our termination of the indemnification agreement we have entered into with him without entering into a replacement or successor agreement, or
                                                            making other appropriate indemnification arrangements in favor of him, on terms reasonably acceptable to him and no less favorable to him than to our other senior executives. Under the Brown Original Agreement, if Mr. Brown’s employment is terminated by us without cause (other than by reason of death or disability) or by Mr. Brown
                                              as a result of a constructive termination, then Mr. Brown will be entitled to receive from us compensation that has accrued but not yet been paid and, subject to his execution and delivery of a release of

Under the Brown Original Agreement, if Mr. Brown’s employment is terminated by us for cause or due to Mr. Brown’s death or disability, or upon Mr. Brown’s retirement or
                                            resignation, then Mr. Brown (or his estate or legal representative, as appropriate) will be entitled to receive from us: > Accrued but unpaid base salary and unpaid vacation time through the date of termination; > Earned but unpaid annual cash incentive compensation under our Annual Incentive Plan (or any successor plan) for the prior fiscal year; > Reimbursement of reasonable business expenses incurred prior to the date of termination; and > Other or additional compensation benefits, if any, in accordance with the terms of our applicable plans or employee benefit programs for terminated
                                                        employees. Under the Brown Original Agreement, if Mr. Brown’s employment is terminated due to death or disability, then Mr. Brown (or his estate or legal representative,
                                            as appropriate) also will be entitled to receive from us the vesting of any equity-based awards then held by him, if and to the extent provided in the applicable plan and award agreements. We may, at our option,
                                            terminate Mr. Brown’s employment in the event of his disability. The Brown Original Agreement also provides that he may not for a two-year period following termination of his employment for any reason, without our prior

The Brown Original Agreement also contains a non-disparagement clause applicable during the term of his employment and for a period of two years thereafter. If there is a change in control of the Company (including the Merger) and Mr. Brown’s employment terminates under circumstances provided under his change in
                                            control severance agreement discussed below under “Potential Payments Under Executive Change in Control Severance Arrangements,” then Mr. Brown will be entitled to the compensation and benefits provided under his

                                                      using a “3X” multiple. In addition, his outstanding stock options (other than those granted as part of the integration award) and restricted stock units would become fully vested, exercisable and
                                                      payable (as applicable), and options would remain exercisable for their full remaining term. Outstanding performance stock units (other than those granted as part of the integration award) would remain

                                                        benefits under the L3 CIC Plan and are extended to 24 months following termination of employment. Potential Payments Under Malave Letter Agreement We are party to the Malave Letter Agreement with Mr. Malave pursuant to which he was appointed Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of L3Harris
                                          effective June 29, 2019 (the “Start Date”). The Malave Letter Agreement includes the following compensation and benefits: > base salary at the annual rate of $625,000; > eligibility to receive an annual cash incentive under our Annual Incentive Plan with a target value of 100% of his base salary; > commencing with calendar year 2020, eligibility to receive annual equity awards granted under our Equity Incentive Plan with a target value of
                                                      $2,000,000; > one-time restricted stock unit award granted in August 2019 under our Equity Incentive Plan with a grant date value of $950,000 (“One-Time RSU
                                                      Award”), subject to vesting ratably over three years; > a one-time momentum equity award granted in August 2019 under our Equity Incentive Plan comprised of (a) performance share units with a target value
                                                      of $660,000; and (b) performance-based stock options with a grant date value of $1,340,000 and a term of ten years. Both components of the momentum equity award will be subject to three-year cliff
                                                      vesting and will vest (if at all) subject to achievement of applicable cost synergy goals for the Merger established by the Compensation Committee; > a one-time cash sign-on bonus of $200,000; > eligibility to participate in our retirement and employee health and welfare plans; and > certain relocation benefits. Under the Malave Letter Agreement, in the event that L3Harris terminates Mr. Malave without “cause” (as defined in the Malave Letter Agreement) or he terminates his employment for
                                          “good reason” (as defined in the Malave Letter Agreement) within 36 months after the Start Date: > the One-Time RSU Award will become fully vested; > if such termination is not in connection with a “change in control” (as defined in the Malave Letter Agreement), then subject to certain conditions,
                                                      Mr. Malave will receive a severance benefit equal to (i) his then current annual base salary (provided that, in the event of a termination by him for good reason due to material reduction in his base
                                                      salary, the severance will be in an amount equal to his annual base salary before such material reduction), and (ii) a pro rata annual cash bonus for the performance period in which his termination
                                                      occurs, subject to actual achievement of applicable performance goals through the end of such performance period; and > if (in either case) such termination is on or following a “change in control” and within 36 months after the Start Date, then, in lieu of any
                                                      severance benefits payable as described above, and subject to certain conditions, Mr. Malave will receive a severance benefit equal to (i) a “2X” multiple of his then current annual base salary
                                                      (provided that, in the event of a termination by him for good reason due to material reduction in his base salary, the severance will be in an amount equal to his annual base salary before such material
                                                      reduction) plus his then current target annual cash bonus, and (ii) a pro rata annual cash bonus for the performance period in which his termination occurs, subject to actual achievement of applicable
                                                      performance goals through the end of such performance period, pro-rated based on the number of days he was employed during such performance period. Mr. Malave’s entitlement to severance benefits under the Malave Letter Agreement is in lieu of severance benefits under any L3Harris severance plan or other severance benefits to which he may be entitled.
                                              However, if L3Harris implements a new executive severance plan or plans in which he is eligible to participate with terms and benefits equal to or in excess of those in the Malave Letter Agreement, then his
                                              right to severance benefits will be determined solely in accordance with the terms of such new plan(s), which will replace and supersede the terms of Malave Letter Agreement. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 75 Table of Contents COMPENSATION TABLES POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR A CHANGE IN CONTROL Potential Payments Under Executive Change in Control Severance Arrangements Change in Control Severance Agreements Prior to the Merger, the Harris Board had approved change in control severance agreements for our pre-Merger Board-elected or appointed officers, including those
                                          named executive officers of L3Harris who were employed by Harris at the time of the Merger (Messrs. Brown and Zoiss), to provide continuity of management and ensure dedication of our executives in the event of a
                                          threatened or actual change in control. Under these agreements, we would provide severance benefits to those officers if, within two years following a “change in control:” > The executive terminates employment for “good reason;” or > We terminate the executive’s employment for any reason other than for “cause” (all terms as defined in the change in control severance agreement and
                                                      summarized below). Benefits are paid only on a “double trigger” basis: in other words, there must be both a change in control and a qualifying termination of employment. Meaning of “change in control.” Under these
                                            agreements, a “change in control” generally means the occurrence of any one of the following events: > Any person becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock; > A change in the majority of our Board not approved by two-thirds of our incumbent directors; > The consummation of a merger, consolidation or reorganization, unless immediately following such transaction: (1) more than 60% of the total voting
                                                      power resulting from the transaction is represented by shares that were our voting securities immediately prior to the transaction; (2) no person becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the total
                                                      voting power of our outstanding voting securities as a result of the transaction; and (3) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the company resulting from the transaction were
                                                      our incumbent directors at the time of our Board’s approval of the execution of the initial agreement providing for the transaction; > Our shareholders approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of L3Harris; or > We consummate a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. The Merger constituted a change in control under these agreements. Meaning of “good reason.” Under these agreements,
                                            “good reason” generally means: > A reduction in the executive’s annual base salary or current annual incentive target award; > The assignment of duties or responsibilities that are inconsistent in any material adverse respect with the executive’s position, duties,
                                                      responsibility or status with us immediately prior to the change in control; > A material adverse change in the executive’s reporting responsibilities, titles or offices with us as in effect immediately prior to the change in
                                                      control; > Any requirement that the executive: (1) be based more than 50 miles from the facility where the executive was located at the time of the change in
                                                      control or (2) travel on L3Harris business to an extent substantially greater than the travel obligations of the executive immediately prior to the change in control; or > Failure by us to continue in effect any employee benefit or compensation plans or provide the executive with employee benefits as in effect for the
                                                      executive immediately prior to the change in control. Meaning of “cause.” Under these agreements, the term “cause” generally
                                            means: > A material breach by the executive of the duties and responsibilities of the executive’s position; or > The conviction of the executive of, or plea of nolo contendere by the executive to, a felony involving willful misconduct that is materially
                                                      injurious to us. Potential cash severance payment. If triggered, the
                                            lump-sum cash severance benefit payable to an executive under the executive’s change in control severance agreement would consist of: > Unpaid base salary through the date of termination; > A pro-rated annual bonus (as determined under the change in control severance agreement); > Any unpaid accrued vacation pay; > To the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, any other benefits or awards that have been earned or became payable
                                                        pursuant to the terms of any compensation plan but that have not yet been paid to the executive; 76 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION TABLES POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR A CHANGE IN CONTROL > Two times the executive’s highest annual rate of base salary during the 12-month period prior to the date of termination (following the Merger,
                                                      “three times” in the case of Mr. Brown pursuant to the Brown Letter Agreement); and > Two times the greatest of the executive’s (1) highest annual bonus in the three years prior to the change in control, (2) target bonus for the year
                                                      in which the change in control occurred or (3) target bonus for the year in which the executive’s employment is terminated (following the Merger, “three times” in the case of Mr. Brown pursuant to the
                                                      Brown Letter Agreement). Other potential severance benefits. In addition, if
                                            triggered, severance benefits to an executive under the executive’s change in control severance agreement include: > Receipt of the same level of medical, dental, accident, disability and life insurance and any similar benefits as are in effect on the date of
                                                      termination (or the highest level of coverage provided to active executives immediately prior to the change in control, if more favorable), for the two years following the date of termination, but in no
                                                      event later than age 65 (benefit continuation payments in lieu of providing in-kind medical and prescription drug coverage, in the case of Mr. Brown pursuant to the Brown Letter Agreement); > Reimbursement for any relocation expense related to the pursuit of other business opportunities incurred within two years following the date of
                                                      termination; > Reimbursement for recruitment or placement services of up to $4,000; and > Reimbursement for professional financial or tax planning services of up to $5,000 per year for the calendar year in which the termination occurs and
                                                      the next calendar year. The change in control severance arrangements with Mr. Malave are pursuant to the Malave Letter Agreement, and those arrangements are described in the “Agreement with Mr.
                                                Malave” discussion beginning on page 54. L3 Change in Control Severance Plan Prior to the Merger, L3 had adopted the L3 CIC Plan covering its executive officers and other corporate employees, including Messrs. Kubasik and Gautier, to
                                          maintain alignment of the interests of individuals covered by the plan and shareholders during the period of an actual or rumored change in control and facilitate objective assessment of potential transactions that
                                          may be in the best interests of L3 shareholders but could negatively impact the covered individual’s future employment. Under the L3 CIC Plan, severance benefits would be provided to L3 executive officers,
                                          including Messrs. Kubasik and Gautier, and other individuals covered by the plan if, within two years following a “change in control”: > The executive terminates employment for “good reason”; or > The executive’s employment is terminated without “cause” (all terms as defined in the L3 CIC Plan and summarized below). Benefits are paid only on a “double trigger” basis: in other words, there must be both a change in control and a qualifying termination of employment. In
                                          addition, the L3 CIC Plan covers terminations that become effective prior to the occurrence of a change in control if such termination occurs (a) upon the request of the acquiror or (b) otherwise in anticipation of
                                          the change in control. Meaning of “change in control.” Under the L3 CIC Plan,
                                            a “change in control” generally means the occurrence of any one of the following events: > the acquisition by any person or group (including a group within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), other than L3 or
                                                      any of its subsidiaries, of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of a majority of the combined voting power of L3’s then outstanding voting
                                                      securities, other than by any employee benefit plan maintained by L3; > the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of L3 and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; or > the election, including the filling of vacancies, during any period of 24 months or less, of 50% or more of the members of the board of directors of
                                                      L3, without the approval of L3’s incumbent directors at the beginning of such period. The Merger constituted a change in control under the L3 CIC Plan, and we are obligated to provide the severance benefits under the L3 CIC Plan, if triggered. Meaning of “good reason.” Under the L3 CIC Plan, “good reason”
                                                    generally means, other than due to employee’s disability or death: > A reduction in the executive’s base salary or annual or long-term incentive opportunity (including target bonus, if applicable); > An adverse change to the calculation methodology for determining bonuses or long-term incentives which is reasonably likely to have an
                                                              adverse impact on the amounts the executive has the potential to earn under such programs; L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 77 Table of Contents COMPENSATION TABLES POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR A CHANGE IN CONTROL > Any failure by the acquiror to continue to provide employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those afforded to the
                                                      executive immediately prior to the change in control; > A material adverse change in executive’s duties or responsibilities; > A relocation of executive’s principal place of business of 50 miles or more, provided that such relocation also increases the executive’s commute by
                                                      at least 25 miles; > A failure to pay the executive’s base salary and other amounts earned by the executive within 10 days after the date such compensation is due; or > Failure of any successor or assignee to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of L3 in connection with any change in control, by
                                                      agreement in writing in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the executive, expressly, absolutely and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform all obligations under the L3 CIC Plan. Meaning of “cause.” Under the L3 CIC Plan, the term
                                            “cause” generally means: > Intentional failure to perform reasonably assigned duties; > Dishonesty or willful misconduct in the performance of duties; > Engaging in a transaction in connection with the performance of duties to L3 or its affiliates which transaction is adverse to the interests of L3
                                                      and is engaged in for personal profit; or > Willful violation of any law, rule or regulation in connection with the performance of duties (other than traffic violations or similar offenses). Potential cash severance payment. If triggered, the
                                            lump-sum cash severance benefit payable to an executive under the L3 CIC Plan would consist of: > A multiple of current annual salary and average annual incentive plan awards for the prior three years: (a) chief executive officer, chief operating
                                                      officer, chief financial officer and chief legal officer – three times (including for Mr. Kubasik), and (b) segment presidents – two and a half times (including for Mr. Gautier). The annual incentive
                                                      plan award for the year of termination is a pro rata award based on (a) the number of months worked in the year of termination and (b) the average annual incentive plan awards for the prior three years
                                                      (or the actual annual incentive plan award payable for the full year of termination, if performance is determinable at the time of termination). Other potential severance benefits. In addition, if
                                            triggered, severance benefits to an executive under the L3 CIC Plan include: > Receipt of continued medical and life insurance benefits at the same cost to the executive, or cash equal to any increased premiums, for the same
                                                      period as the severance multiple described above; > Reasonable outplacement services paid for by L3; and > If eligible, L3-paid financial planning services for the one-year period after a change in control under an L3 policy that is separate from the L3
                                                      CIC Plan. For a summary of the modifications to the L3 CIC Plan applicable to Mr. Kubasik relating to the definitions of “cause” and “good reason”, see the “Potential
                                          Payments Under Kubasik Letter Agreement” section beginning on page 74. L3Harris Executive Change in Control Severance Plan The Merger constituted a change in control transaction under the change in control severance arrangements described above, which are still operative for
                                          applicable covered individuals, including our named executive officers who were employed with L3 or Harris at the time of the Merger. In February 2020, we adopted the new L3Harris Executive Change in Control
                                          Severance Plan, which provides severance benefits to executive officers and certain other executives (excluding our CEO and COO) if the executive is terminated without “cause” or resigns for “good reason” (such as
                                          a material adverse change in compensation or job responsibilities or location) within two years following a change in control. The plan includes a “double trigger” so that we would provide benefits only if there is
                                          both a change in control and a termination of employment. The terms of the new plan do not apply for our CEO and COO and also do not apply for individuals covered by the change in control severance arrangements
                                          described above until after the expiration of the applicable change in control severance arrangements described above. Our executive change in control severance arrangements reflect sound practices because they > Do not provide for a tax gross-up of excise taxes; > Do provide for a “best net after-tax” payment approach that reduces payments and benefits to an executive if the reduction would result in the executive receiving
                                                        higher payments and benefits on a net after-tax basis; > Do provide that we will reimburse the executive for any legal fees and costs with respect to any dispute arising under the arrangement; and 78 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents COMPENSATION TABLES POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR A CHANGE IN CONTROL > With respect to our change in control severance agreements approved by the Harris Board prior to the Merger, do provide that, not later than the date on which a change in control occurs, we are
                                                          required to contribute to an irrevocable “rabbi trust” in cash or other liquid assets, an amount equal to the total payments expected to be paid under the agreements, assuming that the employment of
                                                          the executives is terminated, plus the amount of trust administration and trustee fees reasonably expected to be incurred (in recognition that in certain situations payments under the agreements
                                                          will be required to be deferred for up to six months following the triggering event to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code). (This funding requirement was waived in respect of the
                                                          Merger.) Termination Payments Generally Available to Salaried Employees Many of our salaried employees, including our named executive officers, are entitled to receive certain elements of compensation on a non-discretionary basis
                                            upon termination of employment for any reason. Subject to the exceptions noted below, these include: > Accrued salary and pay for unused vacation; > Distributions of vested plan balances under our RSP and ERSP (and the SSP-II and L3 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, where applicable); and > Earned but unpaid bonuses.

                                              equity awards described in the following paragraphs regarding termination under various circumstances apply only to outstanding equity awards as of the end of our fiscal transition period (not equity awards
                                              granted afterward during fiscal 2020). Termination for cause. A named executive officer whose employment is terminated by us for cause is not entitled to any
                                            compensation or benefits other than those generally paid to all of our salaried employees upon any termination of employment as described above. In addition, as noted under “Recovery of Executive Compensation
                                            (“Clawback”)” in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this proxy statement, depending on the circumstances giving rise to such termination, we may be entitled to recover all or a portion of any
                                            performance-based compensation if our financial statements are restated as a result of errors, omissions or fraud. Annual incentive awards, vested and unvested options, including performance stock options,
                                            performance share units, and restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock are automatically forfeited following a termination for cause or misconduct. Involuntary termination without cause. In the case of termination of employment by us without cause, each of Messrs.
                                            Brown, Kubasik and Malave is entitled to compensation and benefits under his respective employment agreement described above, and our other named executive officers are entitled to compensation or benefits under
                                            the change in control severance arrangements described above because the Merger constituted a change in control under the arrangements between the other named executive officer and us (including L3) at the time
                                            of the Merger. Under our Annual Incentive Plan, following an involuntary termination by us without cause, if the executive was employed a minimum of 180 days during the
                                            fiscal year, annual incentive compensation awards are paid pro-rata based on the period worked during such fiscal year, with payment made after the fiscal year end based on our performance. Except as set forth above for Messrs. Brown and Kubasik under their respective employment agreements, under our equity incentive plans, following an
                                            involuntary termination by us other than for cause or misconduct: > Vested options may be exercised until the sooner of 90 days following such termination or the regularly scheduled expiration date; > Unvested options are forfeited; > Vested performance stock options may be exercised until the regularly scheduled expiration date; > Unvested performance stock options are forfeited, although a pro-rata portion (based on the period worked during the performance period) will remain outstanding
                                                          and eligible to be earned and to vest based on satisfaction of the performance vesting condition and become exercisable upon expiration of the service period; > Unvested performance share units are forfeited, although a pro-rata portion (based on the period worked during the performance period) will remain outstanding and

                                              named executive officer who voluntarily terminates or resigns employment (other than due to retirement or for good reason) is not entitled to any compensation or benefits other than those generally paid to all
                                              of our salaried employees upon any termination of employment as described above. Annual incentive awards and unvested stock options, including performance stock options, performance share units, restricted
                                              stock units and shares of restricted stock are automatically forfeited following a voluntary termination or resignation. Vested options may be exercised until the sooner of 30 days (90 days, in the case of
                                              performance stock options) following a voluntary termination or resignation or the regularly scheduled expiration date. Upon voluntary termination for good reason by an executive officer, except as otherwise provided in the Brown Letter Agreement, the Kubasik Letter Agreement or the
                                              Malave Letter Agreement, in the case of Messrs. Brown, Kubasik and Malave, respectively: > Vested performance stock options may be exercised until the regularly scheduled expiration date; > Unvested performance stock options are forfeited, although a pro-rata portion (based on the period worked during the performance period) will remain outstanding and
                                                        eligible to be earned and to vest based on satisfaction of the performance vesting condition and become exercisable upon termination of the service period; > Unvested performance share units are forfeited, although a pro-rata portion (based on the period worked during the performance period) will remain outstanding and eligible

                                                        target level; and > Restricted stock units immediately vest and are paid as soon as practicable. Death or disability. If a named executive officer’s
                                              employment is terminated as a result of death, his or her beneficiaries are eligible for benefits under the death benefit programs generally available to many of our U.S.-based employees, including basic group
                                              life insurance paid by us and supplemental group life insurance if elected and paid for by the executive. If a named executive officer’s employment is terminated as a result of disability, the executive is
                                              eligible for benefits under the disability programs generally available to many of our U.S.-based employees, which include a long-term disability income benefit and, in most cases, continuation of health and
                                              survivor and accident life insurance coverage applicable to active employees for specified periods, while disabled. In addition, in the case of death or disability: > Account balances in our RSP and ERSP become fully vested; > If the executive was employed for a minimum of 180 days during the fiscal year, annual incentive compensation awards are paid pro-rata based on the period worked
                                                        during such fiscal year, with payment made after the fiscal year end based on our performance; > Performance stock options immediately vest at target and will be exercisable by the beneficiaries (or by the executive officer in the case of disability) for up to

                                                          death and, in the case of disability, following the earlier of expiration of the service period or the occurrence of a change in control that qualifies as a “change in control event” within the
                                                          meaning of Treasury Regulations section 1.409-3(i)(5); > Subject to a minimum one-year holding period, shares of restricted stock immediately fully vest; and > Restricted stock units immediately fully vest and are paid out as soon as administratively practicable. Retirement. Among our named executive officers, as
                                              of January 3, 2020, Messrs. Gautier and Zoiss were retirement-eligible for purposes of our RSP, ERSP, Annual Incentive Plan and equity incentive plans. If a named executive officer’s employment is terminated as
                                              a result of retirement, such named executive officer would receive retirement benefits generally available to our retirement-eligible salaried employees.

As noted above, these change in
                                              control impacts to equity awards apply only to outstanding equity awards as of the end of our fiscal transition period (not equity awards granted afterward during fiscal 2020, which provide for accelerated
                                              vesting after a change in control that occurs following the grant date of those awards only on a “double trigger” basis). Tables of Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control The following tables show, on an executive-by-executive basis, the amounts of the estimated incremental compensation and benefits that would be provided to each of our
                                                  named executive officers in a hypothetical termination as of January 3, 2020 (as described in more detail below) under various circumstances, including termination by us for cause, voluntary termination
                                                  (resignation), termination by the executive for good reason or for constructive termination, involuntary termination by us without cause, death, disability, retirement (to the extent the executive is
                                                  retirement-eligible), or termination by us without cause or by the executive for good reason following a future change in control of L3Harris, as well as in the event of a future change in control of

                                                  control. As noted above, the Merger constituted a change in control under the agreements and other arrangements between the named executive officers and us (including L3) at the time of the Merger, and
                                                  therefore the amounts for many of the circumstances shown in the tables are the same as for termination by us without cause or by the executive for good reason following a future change in control of

                                            and disclosure, from our total employee population of 17,494 full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary workers as of May 1, 2018 (other than our CEO), we excluded all 781 non-U.S. employees1 (less than 5% of
                                            total employees) and then identified the median employee based on W-2 taxable Medicare wages (Box 5) for the 12 months leading up to May 1, 2018, as reported to the Internal Revenue Service. We used the same
                                            median employee for our fiscal transition period ended January 3, 2020 as for fiscal 2018 in our pay ratio calculation, because there were no changes in our employee population (excluding L3 employees, as
                                            permitted under SEC rules) or employee compensation arrangements during our fiscal transition period ended January 3, 2020, that we believe would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. As
                                            noted, as a result of the Merger occurring during our fiscal transition period ended January 3, 2020, we excluded from our employee population data described above approximately 31,000 employees who were
                                            employees of L3 at the time of the Merger. We calculated such median employee’s total compensation of $58,426 for our fiscal transition period ended January 3, 2020, in the same manner we calculated our CEO’s
                                            total compensation of $15,745,630 for our fiscal transition period ended January 3, 2020, as reported in the “Total” column of the Fiscal Transition Period Summary Compensation Table on page 62. Based on this
                                            information, for our fiscal transition period ended January 3, 2020, the ratio of the median of the total compensation of all employees (other than our CEO and former L3 employees) to the total compensation of
                                            our CEO was 1:269, which pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Because applicable SEC rules permit various methodologies, assumptions and
                                            exclusions, such pay ratio may not be comparable to pay ratios calculated and disclosed by other companies. 1 Approximate number of non-U.S. employees excluded, by jurisdiction: Australia (175), Canada (116), Germany (78), Pakistan (25),
                                                      United Arab Emirates (16), United Kingdom (310) and 10 or fewer in each of Algeria, Brazil, Estonia, France, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and

                                            incorporated by reference into any other previous or future filings by us under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent we specifically
                                            incorporate this Report by reference therein. The role of the Audit Committee is, among other things, to assist the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“L3Harris”) in its
                                            oversight of: > the integrity of L3Harris’ financial statements; > L3Harris’ compliance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements; > L3Harris’ internal control over financial reporting; > the qualifications and independence of L3Harris’ independent registered public accounting firm; and > the performance of L3Harris’ internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm. The Board has determined that, in its business judgment, all members of L3Harris’ Audit Committee are independent within the meaning of the listing standards of the New York
                                            Stock Exchange, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and L3Harris’ Director Independence Standards. L3Harris’ management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of L3Harris’ financial statements and the effectiveness of L3Harris’ system
                                            of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Management and L3Harris’ Internal Audit department are responsible for maintaining and evaluating appropriate accounting and
                                            financial reporting practices and internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. L3Harris’ independent registered public accounting
                                            firm for its fiscal transition period, Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”), was responsible for auditing L3Harris’ consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion as to whether such financial statements are
                                            presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. EY also was responsible for auditing the effectiveness of L3Harris’ internal control
                                            over financial reporting. Representatives of EY attended all regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee during the fiscal transition period. The Audit Committee met and held discussions with management,
                                            the head of Internal Audit and EY, and discussed with the internal auditors and EY the overall scope of, and plans for, their respective audits and the identification of audit risks. The Audit Committee also met
                                            with EY and the head of Internal Audit, Principal Accounting Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their respective examinations, the reasonableness
                                            of significant judgments, the evaluations of L3Harris’ internal control over financial reporting and the overall quality of L3Harris’ financial reporting. Management has represented to the Audit Committee that
                                            L3Harris’ consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In the performance of its oversight functions, the Audit Committee has: > reviewed and discussed with management and EY L3Harris’ internal control over financial reporting, including a review of management’s report on its assessment and
                                                        EY’s audit of the effectiveness of L3Harris’ internal control over financial reporting and any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses; > considered, reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and EY, including a discussion of the quality of the accounting principles, the
                                                        reasonableness thereof, significant adjustments, if any, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements, as well as critical accounting policies and other financial accounting and
                                                        reporting principles and practices; > discussed with EY the matters required to be discussed under the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit

                                                        regarding EY’s communications with an audit committee concerning independence, and discussed with EY its independence; > reviewed the services provided by EY other than its audit services and considered whether the provision of such other services by EY is compatible with maintaining
                                                        its independence, discussed with EY its independence, and concluded that EY is independent from L3Harris and its management; and > reviewed the contents of SEC-required certification statements from the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and also discussed and reviewed the
                                                        process and internal controls for providing reasonable assurances that the financial statements included in L3Harris’ Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the fiscal transition period ended January 3,
                                                        2020 are true in all important respects, and that the report contains all appropriate material information of which they are aware. In reliance on the reports, reviews and discussions described in this Report, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved,
                                            that the audited financial statements be included in L3Harris’ Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the fiscal transition period ended January 3, 2020, for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee also has
                                            appointed, and has requested shareholder ratification of its appointment of, EY as L3Harris’ independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending January 1, 2021. Submitted on February 27, 2020 by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. Lewis Kramer, Chairperson Sallie B. Bailey Peter W. Chiarelli Thomas A. Corcoran L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 87 Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Our Board unanimously recommends voting FOR ratification of appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending January 1, 2021 . > Independent accounting firm with breadth of knowledge, support and expertise of accessible national office. > Significant industry and government
                      contracting expertise. > Periodic mandated rotation of audit firm’s
                      lead engagement partner. Our Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) to audit our books and accounts and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending January 1, 2021. Although
        not required by applicable law, our Board believes that obtaining shareholder ratification of the appointment is a sound corporate governance practice. If our shareholders do not ratify the appointment of EY, our Audit Committee will reconsider
        whether to retain EY, and may either do so or hire another firm without resubmitting the matter to shareholders for approval. We expect that a representative of EY will be present at the 2020 Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions from
        shareholders and to make a statement if he or she desires to do so. As provided in our Audit Committee’s charter and as discussed above, our Audit Committee is responsible for directly appointing, compensating, retaining, terminating and overseeing our
        independent registered public accounting firm. Although we have a very long-standing relationship with EY, our Audit Committee frequently evaluates the independence and effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firm and its
        personnel, as well as the cost and quality of its audit and audit-related services. Our Audit Committee retains the discretion at any time to appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm. In accordance with sound corporate
        governance practices and in order to ensure that our Audit Committee and our shareholders are receiving the best and most cost-effective audit services available, our Audit Committee periodically considers issuing a “request for proposal” to EY and
        other large nationally recognized accounting firms with regard to our audit engagement, which could result in a firm other than EY providing audit engagement services to us in later years. Our Audit Committee used this process in connection with
        its selection and appointment of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending January 1, 2021. 88 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF
                        INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Fees Paid to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm EY served as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal transition period ended January 3, 2020. In addition to the engagement to audit our fiscal transition period
        financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and to review the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, EY also was engaged by us during our fiscal transition period to perform certain tax services.
        The following table presents fees for professional audit services and other services rendered by EY for the fiscal transition period ended January 3, 2020 and the fiscal years ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018: Fiscal Transition Period Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2018 Audit Fees (1) $ 14,922,674 $ 9,679,000 $ 12,243,000 Audit-Related Fees (2) $ 6,431 $ 0 $ 0 Tax Fees (3) $ 460,529 $ 455,000 $ 1,425,000 All Other Fees (4) $ 10,615 $ 0 $ 0 Total $ 15,400,249 $ 10,134,000 $ 13,668,000 (1) Audit fees included fees associated with the annual audit and the audit of internal control over financial reporting, as well as reviews of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, SEC registration
                    statements and other filings, comfort letter procedures, accounting and reporting consultations and statutory audits required internationally for certain of our subsidiaries. (2) No audit-related services were rendered or fees billed for fiscal 2019 or 2018. (3) Tax fees for our fiscal transition period consisted of $204,142 related to tax compliance, including foreign and domestic return preparation and transfer pricing studies, and $256,387 related
                    to tax planning and tax advisory services. Tax fees for fiscal 2019 consisted of $125,000 related to tax compliance, including foreign and domestic return preparation and transfer pricing studies, and $330,000 related to tax planning
                    and tax advisory services. Tax fees for fiscal 2018 consisted of $782,000 related to tax compliance, including foreign and domestic return preparation and transfer pricing studies, and $643,000 related to tax planning and tax advisory
                    services. (4) For fiscal 2019 and 2018, no professional services were rendered or fees billed for services not included within Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees or Tax Fees. EY did not perform any professional services related to financial information systems design and implementation for us in our fiscal transition period or in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018. Our Audit Committee has determined that the provision of the services described above is compatible with maintaining EY’s independence. Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Under our Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy and Procedures, our Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm
        to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair the firm’s independence. The policy utilizes a framework of both general pre-approval for certain specified services and specific pre-approval for all other services. Early in each fiscal year, our Audit Committee reviews and, as it deems appropriate, pre-approves the audit services and any audit-related services, tax services and other services to be
        performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, together with specific details regarding such services anticipated to be required for such fiscal year including, when available, estimated fees. Our Audit Committee periodically
        reviews the services provided to date and the actual fees against the estimates, and such fee amounts may be updated to the extent appropriate at regularly scheduled meetings of our Audit Committee. Additional pre-approval is required before actual
        fees for any service can exceed the originally pre-approved amount. Our Audit Committee also may revise the list of pre-approved services and related fees from time to time. Our Audit Committee followed this same process for the fiscal transition
        period, and all of the services described in the table above and related notes were pre-approved in accordance with this policy. If we seek to engage our independent registered public accounting firm for other services that are not considered subject to general pre-approval as described above, then our Audit Committee must
        approve such specific engagement as well as the estimated fees. Such engagement will be presented to our Audit Committee for pre-approval at its next regularly scheduled meeting. If the timing of the project requires an expedited decision, then we
        may ask the Chairperson of our Audit Committee to pre-approve such engagement. Any such pre-approval by the Chairperson is then presented to our full Audit Committee for ratification at the next Audit Committee meeting. In any event, pre-approval

L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 89 Table of Contents OVERVIEW OF PROPOSALS 4, 5 AND 6 Proposals 4, 5, and 6 each request that shareholders approve an amendment to modernize our Restated Certificate of Incorporation as follows: > Remove supermajority voting and “fair price” requirements for business combinations involving interested shareholders (Proposal 4) > Remove the “anti-greenmail” provision (Proposal 5) > Remove the requirement that we have cumulative voting for directors if there is a 40% shareholder (Proposal 6) Each of these proposed amendments to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation will be voted on separately, and they are not conditioned on one another or on the approval of any other proposal
          to be presented at the Annual Meeting. We describe these proposals and the related amendments in more detail below. PROPOSAL 4: TO AMEND OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO ELIMINATE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING AND “FAIR PRICE” REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INVOLVING INTERESTED SHAREHOLDERS Our Board unanimously recommends voting FOR the amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the supermajority voting and “fair price” requirements for business combinations involving interested shareholders. > The
                      supermajority voting and “fair price” requirements for business combinations involving interested shareholders were designed to protect our shareholders against hostile takeovers by activist investors. > Our Board believes the concerns that prompted
                      adopting such supermajority voting and “fair price” requirements in 1984 are now adequately addressed by the corporate law of Delaware, the state in which we are incorporated. > Eliminating these requirements would modernize
                      our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and be more consistent with current corporate governance best practices and governance practices of other S&P 500 companies. BACKGROUND ON OUR SUPERMAJORITY VOTING AND “FAIR PRICE” REQUIREMENTS Article Ninth of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Article Ninth”) contains two requirements, approved by our shareholders in 1984, which were originally intended to protect
        our shareholders against hostile takeovers by activist investors: > Supermajority voting requirement. Article Ninth requires the
                      affirmative vote of holders of at least 80% of our common stock to approve certain business combinations involving an interested shareholder (generally defined for this purpose as a holder of more than 10% of our common stock).
                      Article Ninth includes exceptions to this supermajority voting requirement 90 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents PROPOSAL 4: TO AMEND OUR RESTATED
                              CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO ELIMINATE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING AND "FAIR PRICE" REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INVOLVING INTERESTED SHAREHOLDERS if the business combination with the interested shareholder either has been approved by a majority of our “continuing directors” (as defined in Article Ninth) or
                        satisfies the “fair price” requirement described below. If either of these exceptions applies, the business combination with the interested shareholder instead would be subject to the usual voting requirements of the Delaware
                        General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). > “Fair price” requirement. The “fair price” exception (to the
                            supermajority voting requirement) in Article Ninth requires that the consideration to be received by shareholders in the business combination with the interested shareholder meet or exceed the highest of certain prices
                            previously paid by the interested shareholder and be in cash or generally the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder. These criteria as to amount and form of consideration, in addition to certain notice and
                            information criteria, were common elements of a “fair price” requirement, an anti-takeover measure intended to defend against two-tiered tender offers in which a potential acquirer offers one price for shares needed to gain
                            control of a target company and a lower price (or other less attractive consideration) for the remaining shares, which can pressure shareholders to tender their shares for the tender offer price regardless of their value. A
                            standard “fair price ” provision encourages a potential acquirer to negotiate with a company’s board of directors by requiring the potential acquirer to pay a “fair
                            price” for all shares based on a formula or other criteria unless the acquirer’s offer satisfies specified approval requirements of the company’s board of directors or shareholders. WHY WE PROPOSE TO ELIMINATE THESE REQUIREMENTS In the years since our shareholders approved these supermajority and “fair price” requirements, Delaware corporate law has been amended to provide similar protections.
              Specifically, Section 203 of the DGCL disallows a business combination involving an interested shareholder (defined for this purpose as a shareholder owning more than 15% of a company’s voting stock) for a period of three years after the
              shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless: > the company’s board approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder prior to such business combination or
                          transaction; > the shareholder owned at least 85% of the company’s outstanding voting stock (excluding shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers of the company and shares owned by certain
                          employee benefit plans) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder; or > the business combination was approved by the company’s board of directors and by the affirmative vote of at least 66 and 2/3% of the company’s outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested
                          shareholder. Our Nominating and Governance Committee and our Board believe that Section 203 of the DGCL sufficiently protects our shareholders against the concerns that Article Ninth of our
              Restated Certificate of Incorporation sought to address, making Article Ninth no longer necessary. Our Nominating and Governance Committee and our Board therefore believe that eliminating Article Ninth is in the best interests of L3Harris and
              our shareholders and also would be consistent with current corporate governance best practices and the governance practices of other S&P 500 companies. On the recommendation of our Nominating and Governance Committee, our Board unanimously approved, and recommends that our shareholders approve an amendment to our Restated Certificate of
              Incorporation to eliminate the supermajority voting and “fair price” requirements for business combinations involving interested shareholders by eliminating Article Ninth based on the determination of our Nominating and Governance Committee
              and our Board that such an amendment is in the best interests of L3Harris and our shareholders because Article Ninth is not necessary considering the similar protections afforded by Section 203 of the DGCL and eliminating Article Ninth would
              be consistent with current corporate governance best practices and governance practices of other S&P 500 companies. WHAT HAPPENS IF SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE THIS PROPOSAL If this proposal is approved, Article Ninth’s supermajority voting and “fair price” requirements for business combinations involving interested shareholders would no longer apply, and
              Article Ninth would be eliminated entirely from our Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The primary effects of eliminating Article Ninth would be that, for business combinations previously covered by Article Ninth, the business combination would be
              subject to Board approval, and if the DGCL requires a shareholder vote, to the affirmative vote of shareholders required by the DGCL (including Section 203, if applicable) and our governing documents. If this proposal is approved, it will become effective upon our filing of an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
              promptly after the 2020 Annual Meeting. Such amendment will amend and restate Article Ninth to read in its entirety as follows: “NINTH: Reserved.” If this proposal is not approved, Article Ninth will remain unchanged and as currently in
              effect. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 91 Table of Contents PROPOSAL 5: TO AMEND OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO ELIMINATE THE “ANTI-GREENMAIL” PROVISION Our Board unanimously recommends voting FOR the amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the “anti-greenmail” provision. > “Anti-greenmail” provisions were commonly implemented in the 1980s to prohibit companies from making “greenmail” payments – premium payments to activist investors. > Our Board believes that our
                                    anti-greenmail provision is no longer necessary to combat the threats that it was originally intended to address when adopted in 1985, due to subsequent laws that sufficiently deter “greenmail” payments and the behavior
                                    of activist investors that originally prompted those payments. > Anti-greenmail

























































































                                    provisions now are less common among S&P 500 companies, and our Board believes eliminating our anti-greenmail provision is consistent with current corporate governance best practices. BACKGROUND ON OUR “ANTI-GREENMAIL” PROVISION Article Tenth, Section 1 of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains an “anti-greenmail” provision. This provision requires that, if we wish to repurchase shares of
                          our common stock from an interested shareholder (generally defined as one beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock) and we do not offer the same repurchase terms to our other shareholders, then
                          we cannot repurchase the interested shareholder’s shares without the approval of the shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder plus a majority of the remaining outstanding shares of our common stock. WHY WE PROPOSE TO ELIMINATE THIS PROVISION Our “anti-greenmail” provision, adopted in 1985, was designed to prohibit us from making premium payments to activist investors. It is now uncommon for S&P 500
                          companies to have “anti-greenmail” provisions in their certificates of incorporation, and such provisions are no longer necessary because federal and state laws exist that deter “greenmail” payments as well as the behavior of
                          activist investors that originally prompted “greenmail” payments. Our Nominating and Governance Committee and our Board believe that eliminating our “anti-greenmail” provision is in the best interests of L3Harris and our shareholders because
                          it is no longer necessary to deter the threats it was intended to address when adopted. Also, our Nominating and Governance Committee and our Board believe that eliminating it would be consistent with current corporate governance
                          best practices and governance practices of other S&P 500 companies and would modernize our Restated Certificate of Incorporation. 92 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents PROPOSAL 5: TO AMEND OUR
                                            RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO ELIMINATE THE "ANTI-GREENMAIL" PROVISION WHAT HAPPENS IF SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE THIS PROPOSAL The primary effect of eliminating our “anti-greenmail” provision would be that our Board would be able to authorize such a payment without shareholder approval if
                            it determines the payment to be in the best interests of L3Harris and our shareholders. As noted, our “anti-greenmail” provision is contained in Article Tenth, Section 1 of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Our Board also is separately
                            proposing to eliminate Article Tenth, Section 2 of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as discussed in Proposal 6. For this reason, there are several different ways that the vote on this proposal could impact Article
                            Tenth: > If this proposal and Proposal 6 are both approved: we will file an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
                                        promptly after the 2020 Annual Meeting to amend and restate Article Tenth to read in its entirety: “TENTH: Reserved.” > If neither this proposal nor Proposal 6 is approved: Article Tenth will not be amended and will remain unchanged and as currently in effect. > If this proposal is approved, but Proposal 6 is not approved: we will file an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State promptly
                                        after the 2020 Annual Meeting to amend and restate Article Tenth to read in its entirety as set forth in Appendix B-1 to this proxy statement. > If this proposal is not approved, but Proposal 6 is approved: we will file an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State promptly
                                        after the 2020 Annual Meeting to amend and restate Article Tenth to read in its entirety as set forth in Appendix B-2 to this proxy statement. L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 93 Table of Contents PROPOSAL 6: TO AMEND OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO ELIMINATE THE CUMULATIVE VOTING PROVISION THAT APPLIES WHEN WE HAVE A 40% SHAREHOLDER Our Board unanimously recommends voting FOR the amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the cumulative voting provision that applies when we have a 40% shareholder. > The only cumulative
                                          voting requirement in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation is in Article Tenth, Section 2; it applies when we have a 40% shareholder and was originally adopted in 1985 as an anti-takeover measure. > Cumulative voting
                                          generally is rare among S&P 500 companies, and our Board believes that this limited cumulative voting right is not necessary to protect our shareholders against activist investors. > Our Board also believes
                                          that eliminating this limited cumulative voting right is consistent with current corporate governance best practices, the governance practices of other S&P 500 companies, and the majority voting standard that
                                          otherwise applies to the election of our directors. BACKGROUND ON OUR CUMULATIVE VOTING PROVISION Article Tenth, Section 2 of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation currently provides that when any shareholder holds 40% or more of
                          our common stock, we must use cumulative voting for the election of directors. Cumulative voting entitles each shareholder to one vote per share times the number of directors to be elected and allows a shareholder
                          to allocate those votes among the director nominees in whatever manner the shareholder chooses. For example, a shareholder may concentrate voting power by allocating all of the shareholder’ votes to one director nominee or may
                          distribute those votes among two or more director nominees. As a result, when cumulative voting is in effect, one shareholder (or group of shareholders) holding a relatively small number of shares may, by cumulating votes and
                          applying them to certain director nominees, be able to elect one or more directors even if a majority of shareholders oppose their election. WHY WE PROPOSE TO ELIMINATE THIS PROVISION Our limited cumulative voting requirement (which applies when we have a 40% shareholder), adopted in 1985, was designed as an
                          anti-takeover measure. Moreover, cumulative voting generally is rare among S&P 500 companies, and it is not consistent with the majority voting standard that normally applies to the election of our directors. Our Nominating and Governance Committee and our Board believe that eliminating this limited cumulative voting right is in the best interests of L3Harris and
                          our shareholders because it is not necessary to protect our shareholders against activist investors (as was the intention when it was adopted). In addition, our Nominating and Governance Committee and our Board believe that
                          eliminating this limited cumulative voting right would be consistent with current corporate governance best practices and governance practices of other S&P 500 companies and with the majority voting standard that otherwise
                          applies to the election of our directors, and would modernize our Restated Certificate of Incorporation. 94 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents PROPOSAL 6: TO AMEND OUR
                                            RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO ELIMINATE THE CUMULATIVE VOTING PROVISION THAT APPLIES WHEN WE HAVE A 40% SHAREHOLDER WHAT HAPPENS IF SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE THIS PROPOSAL In general, Delaware corporate law provides that shareholders do not have the right to cumulatively vote their shares in any election of directors unless
                            a company’s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Therefore, the primary effect of eliminating our cumulative voting provision would be that all director elections would be conducted using a standard voting method in
                            which shareholders cast one vote per share per nominee, without regard for whether any shareholder owns 40% or more of our common stock, and the voting standard for director elections would continue to be a majority voting
                            standard in uncontested elections and a plurality voting standard in contested elections. The cumulative voting provision is contained in Article Tenth, Section 2 of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Our Board is also separately
                            proposing to eliminate Article Tenth, Section 1 of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as discussed in Proposal 5. For this reason, there are several different ways that the vote on this proposal could impact Article
                            Tenth: > If Proposal 5 and this proposal are both approved: we will file an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
                                        promptly after the 2020 Annual Meeting to amend and restate Article Tenth to read in its entirety: “TENTH: Reserved.” > If neither Proposal 5 nor this proposal is approved: Article Tenth will not be amended and will remain unchanged and as currently in effect. > If Proposal 5 is approved, but this proposal is not approved: we will file an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of

L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 95 Table of Contents PROPOSAL 7: SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL TO PERMIT THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT Our Board unanimously recommends voting AGAINST the shareholder proposal to permit the ability of shareholders to act by written consent. > We received the
                                                    shareholder proposal and supporting statement set forth below from John Chevedden. According to the information provided to us, John Chevedden, whose address is 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach,
                                                    California 90278, owns more than $2,000 in market value of our common stock as of the date the proposal was submitted to us. The shareholder proposal is required to be voted on at our Annual Meeting only
                                                    if properly presented at our Annual Meeting. In accordance with the applicable proxy statement regulations, the shareholder proposal and supporting statement, for which the Board of Directors of L3Harris
                                                    accepts no responsibility, are as follows: SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL AND SUPPORTING STATEMENT Proposal 7 - Adopt a Mainstream Shareholder Right - Written Consent Shareholders request that our board of directors take the steps necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes
                                        that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to give shareholders the fullest power to act by
                                        written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any appropriate topic for written consent. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 large companies in a single
                                        year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. This proposal topic also won 63%-support at Cigna Corp. (CI) in 2019. This proposal topic would have received higher votes
                                        than 63% to 67% at these companies if more shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice. Our high 25% threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting has bureaucratic pitfalls that trigger minor shareholder errors that could mean that 50% of
                                        shares would need to ask for a special meeting in order to be sure of obtaining the threshold of 25% of requests without errors. One can be sure that management will have an eagle eye to spot any errors. The right for shareholders to act by written consent is gaining acceptance as a more important right than the right to call a special meeting. This also seems to
                                        be the conclusion of the Intel Corporation (INTC) shareholder vote at the 2019 Intel annual meeting. The directors at Intel apparently thought they could divert shareholder attention away from written consent by making it less difficult for shareholders to call a
                                        special meeting. However Intel shareholders responded with greater support for written consent in 2019 compared to 2018. After a 45%-vote (less than a majority vote) for a written consent shareholder proposal The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) said it adopted written
                                        consent in 2019. Perhaps BK is starting a new trend in recognizing that a 45%-vote represents a majority vote from the shares that have access to independent proxy voting advice. Written consent won 44%-support at Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) in 2018 and this increased to 56% support in 2019. Written consent won 47%-support at
                                        United Rentals, Inc. (URI) in 2018 and this increased to 51%-support in 2019. Written consent won 43%-support at Flowserve Corporation (FLS) in 2018 and this increased to 51%-support in 2019.

                                                          PROPOSAL TO PERMIT THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT L3HARRIS’ RESPONSE TO THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL Our Board has considered the shareholder proposal carefully, believes it is unnecessary and not in the best interest of L3Harris and our
                                          shareholders and unanimously recommends voting AGAINST the shareholder proposal for the reasons set forth below. If not otherwise specified, proxies will be voted AGAINST the shareholder proposal. Our Board believes that the ability of shareholders to act by written consent is not necessary because our shareholders currently have the right to call a
                                          special meeting. In 2012, our Board amended our By-Laws to allow shareholders holding 25% of our outstanding common stock to call a special meeting. The provisions in our By-Laws governing the ability to call a
                                          special meeting offer all shareholders a formal and well-informed, fair and equitable opportunity, including advance notice and thorough disclosure to all shareholders, to act rather than enabling a limited group
                                          of shareholders to act by written consent. Shareholder meetings provide an opportunity for discussion and interaction among shareholders so that all points of view may be considered prior to a vote. By contrast, enabling a small group of shareholders to act by written consent could deprive the remaining shareholders of these important rights, while
                                          presenting an opportunity for special interest investors (including those who accumulate a short-term voting position through the borrowing of shares) with no fiduciary duties to other shareholders to initiate
                                          action with no prior notice either to the other shareholders or to L3Harris, thus precluding the opportunity for all shareholders to deliberate in an open and transparent manner and to consider arguments for and
                                          against any action, including our Board’s views and potential alternatives our Board might propose. The ability of shareholders to act by written consent as reflected in the shareholder proposal also could cause confusion and disruption. For example, multiple
                                          shareholder groups could solicit written consents simultaneously, which could result in duplicative or contradictory written consents. Our Board believes that matters of sufficient importance to warrant action between annual meetings of shareholders should not be decided without notification to
                                          all shareholders, the benefit of consideration and input by our Board and an opportunity for all shareholders to be heard and to vote at a meeting. We are committed to engaging with our shareholders and listening to their perspectives. We regularly engage in discussions with investors, investor advocates and
                                          key opinion leaders on a broad variety of governance issues. In addition to the right to call a special meeting and extensive shareholder outreach, we maintain other strong corporate governance practices that protect the
                                          rights of all shareholders, including: > Annual election of directors, with majority voting and a resignation policy for directors in uncontested elections. > Proxy access provisions (proactively adopted), which enable shareholders to nominate directors to be included in our proxy materials subject to satisfying procedural
                                                      and eligibility requirements. > Shareholders’ ability to submit proposals to be considered at our annual meetings. > Lead Independent Director with expansive duties. > Engaged, experienced and diverse Board, which held 17 Board and committee meetings during our fiscal transition period and 36 Board and committee meetings during our
                                                      fiscal 2019. > Shareholder access to our Board, as described in the “Communicating With Our Board of Directors” section of this proxy statement beginning on page 22. > No “poison pill.” In summary, our Board opposes this shareholder proposal because our Board believes it is not necessary given the existing right of our shareholders to call
                                          special meetings, it could provide an opportunity for advancement of special interests and short-termism and it could potentially cause confusion and disruption. For these reasons, and in light of our strong
                                          commitment to corporate governance practices that protect the rights of all shareholders, our Board unanimously recommends voting AGAINST the shareholder proposal.

RECEIVING PROXY MATERIALS What is a proxy and what is a proxy statement? A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the shares you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as
                                                        your proxy, the document in which you make that designation also is called a proxy. A proxy statement is a document that we are required by law to provide to you when we ask you to name a proxy to
                                                        vote your shares. This document you are reading is a proxy statement, and we encourage you to read it carefully. Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials? The rules of the SEC permit us to furnish proxy materials over the Internet. As a result, our practice is to mail to most of our shareholders a
                                                        Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of our proxy materials. All shareholders receiving the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will have the
                                                        ability to access our proxy materials over the Internet and also may request to receive a paper copy of our proxy materials by mail. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials contains

                                                        ongoing basis. * If it becomes
                                                          necessary due to coronavirus/COVID-19 precautions or impacts to change the date, time, location (including to Melbourne, Florida) and/or means of holding the Annual Meeting (including solely by
                                                          means of remote communication), we will announce the change(s) in advance, and details on how to participate will be issued by press release, posted on our website and filed as additional proxy
                                                          materials.

A record date is the date, as of the close of business on which, shareholders of record are entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of
                                                          shareholders. The record date for the 2020 Annual Meeting is February 28, 2020 and was established by our Board as required under the laws of Delaware, our state of incorporation. Thus,

You have a choice of voting your shares: > Over the Internet; > By telephone; > By mail; or > In person at the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to vote your shares over the Internet, by telephone or by mail. Please carefully
                                                          read the instructions below on how to vote your shares. Because the instructions vary depending on how you own your shares and the method you use to vote your shares, it is important to follow the
                                                          instructions for your particular situation. If you vote your shares over the Internet or by telephone, you should not return a proxy/voting instruction card. What is the difference between a “record holder” and a “beneficial owner” holding shares in “street name”? You are a “record holder” if your shares are registered in your name, in which case you either hold a stock certificate or have an account
                                                          directly with our transfer agent, Computershare Shareowner Services. Your shares are held in “street name” if your shares are registered or held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, in
                                                          which case you are considered the “beneficial owner” of such shares. 102 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING How do I vote my shares if I am a “record holder” (shares registered in my name)?

L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 103 Table of Contents INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING What happens if I return an unmarked proxy/voting instruction card? If you properly execute and return a proxy/voting instruction card with no votes marked, your shares will be voted as recommended by our Board. Our Board’s
                                                          recommendations, together with the description of each proposal, are included earlier in this proxy statement. In summary, our Board unanimously recommends you vote: > FOR election of all

Could other matters be decided at the meeting? At the date of this proxy statement, our Board did not know of any matters to be raised at the Annual Meeting other than those referred to in this proxy statement
                                                          and did not intend to bring before the Annual Meeting any matter other than the proposals described in this proxy statement. The deadline under our By-Laws for any shareholder proposal not discussed
                                                          in this proxy statement to be properly presented at the Annual Meeting has passed. If any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof,
                                                          your shares will be voted at the discretion of the proxy holders. How will my shares be voted if I do not provide instructions to my broker? It is possible for a proxy to indicate that some of the shares represented are not being voted with respect to certain proposals. This occurs, for
                                                        example, when a broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretion under NYSE rules to vote on a matter without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and has not received such
                                                        instructions. In these cases, the unvoted shares will not be considered present and entitled to vote with respect to that matter, although they may be considered present and entitled to vote for other
                                                        purposes and will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. Under NYSE rules, no proposal in this proxy statement (other than Proposal 3 to ratify our Audit Committee’s appointment of Ernst & Young LLP
                                                        as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year 2020) is “routine” and, as such, your broker, bank or other nominee will not have the discretion to vote your shares on any
                                                        proposal in this proxy statement (other than Proposal 3). 104 L3HARRIS 2020 PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING What is the required vote for each proposal?
