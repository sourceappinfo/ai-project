Directors SHARON L. HECK, Secretary Omaha, Nebraska March 13, 2015 A shareholder may request meeting credentials for admission to the meeting by

record owner, possession of a proxy card will be adequate identification.

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. 3555 Farnam Street Omaha, Nebraska 68131 PROXY STATEMENT FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS May 2, 2015 This statement is furnished in connection with the
solicitation by the Board of Directors (“Board”) of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (hereinafter “Berkshire” or “Corporation” or “Company”) of proxies in the accompanying form for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to
be held on Saturday, May 2, 2015 at 3:45 p.m. and at any adjournment thereof. This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy were first sent to shareholders on or about March 13, 2015. If the form of proxy enclosed herewith is
executed and returned as requested, it may nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to exercise by filing an instrument revoking it or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date. Solicitation of proxies will be made solely by mail at the
Corporation’s expense. The Corporation will reimburse brokerage firms, banks, trustees and others for their actual out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding proxy material to the beneficial owners of its common stock. As of the close of business on March 4, 2015, the record date for the Annual Meeting, the Corporation had outstanding and entitled
to vote 824,920 shares of Class A Common Stock (hereinafter called “Class A Stock”) and 1,227,069,442 shares of Class B Common Stock (hereinafter called “Class B Stock”). Each share of Class A Stock is
entitled to one vote per share and each share of Class B Stock is entitled to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the Corporation. The Class A Stock and Class B Stock
vote together as a single class on the matters described in this proxy statement. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2015 are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting or at any adjournment thereof. The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of Class A Stock and Class B Stock holding in the aggregate a
majority of the voting power of the Corporation’s stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. A plurality of the votes properly cast for the election of directors by the shareholders attending the meeting,
in person or by proxy, will elect directors to office. However, pursuant to the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Corporate Governance Guidelines, if a director nominee in an uncontested election receives a greater number of votes “withheld” from
his or her election than votes “for” that director’s election, the nominee shall promptly offer his or her resignation to the Board. A committee consisting of the Board’s independent directors (which will specifically exclude any
director who is required to offer his or her own resignation) shall consider all relevant factors and decide on behalf of the Board the action to be taken with respect to such offered resignation and will determine whether to accept the resignation
or take other action. The Corporation will publicly disclose the Board’s decision with regard to any resignation offered under these circumstances with an explanation of how the decision was reached, including, if applicable, the reasons for
rejecting the offered resignation. A majority of votes properly cast upon any other question shall decide the question.
Abstentions will count for purposes of establishing a quorum, but will not count as votes cast for the election of directors or any other question. Accordingly, abstentions will have no effect on the election of directors and are the equivalent of
an “against” vote on matters requiring a majority of votes properly cast to decide the question. Broker non-votes will not count for purposes of establishing a quorum or as votes cast for the election of directors or any other question and
accordingly will have no effect. Shareholders who send in proxies but attend the meeting in person may vote directly if they prefer and withdraw their proxies or may allow their proxies to be voted with the similar proxies sent in by other
shareholders. IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING TO BE HELD ON MAY 2, 2015. The Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 2, 2015 and the 2014 Annual Report to the Shareholders are available at www.berkshirehathaway.com/eproxy. 1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS At
the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a Board of Directors consisting of 12 members will be elected, each director to hold office until a successor is elected and qualified, or until the director resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified. The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee (“Governance Committee”) has established certain attributes
that it seeks in identifying candidates for directors. In particular the Governance Committee looks for individuals who have very high integrity, business savvy, an owner-oriented attitude and a deep genuine interest in Berkshire. These are the same
attributes that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, believes to be essential if one is to be an effective member of the Board of Directors. In considering candidates for director, the Governance Committee considers the entirety
of each candidate’s credentials in the context of these attributes. In the judgment of the Governance Committee as well as that of the Board as a whole, each of the candidates being nominated for director possesses such attributes. Upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee and Mr. Buffett, the Board of Directors has nominated for election the 12 current

nominees, or (ii) to elect such lesser number to constitute the whole Board as equals the number of nominees who are able to serve. 3 Directors’ Independence The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has concluded that the following directors are independent in accordance with the
director independence standards of the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Item 407(a) of Regulation S-K, and has determined that none of them has a material relationship with the Corporation which would impair his or her
independence from management or otherwise compromise his or her ability to act as an independent director: Stephen B. Burke; Susan L. Decker; William H. Gates III; David S. Gottesman; Charlotte Guyman; Thomas S. Murphy; Walter
Scott, Jr. and Meryl B. Witmer. In making its determination with respect to Mr. Scott, the Governance Committee
considered his role as a director of and the holder (along with family members and related entities) of 9.1% of the voting stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) in which the Corporation owns approximately 89.9% of the voting
stock. The Governance Committee also considered the agreement between the Corporation and Mr. Scott that requires Mr. Scott and his related family interests, before selling their BHE shares, to give the Corporation the right of first
refusal to purchase their shares (if the Corporation is legally permitted to buy them) or the opportunity to assign its right to purchase to a third party (if it is not legally permitted to buy them). That same agreement also gives Mr. Scott
and his related family interests the right to put their shares to the Corporation (if the Corporation is legally permitted to buy them) at fair market value to be determined by independent appraisal if the sellers do not agree with the price offered
by the Corporation, and payable in Berkshire shares. The Governance Committee considered these relationships in light of the attributes it believes need to be possessed by independent-minded directors, including personal financial substance and
a lack of economic dependence on the Corporation, as well as business wisdom and ownership of Berkshire shares. The Governance Committee concluded that Mr. Scott’s relationships, rather than interfering with his ability to be
independent from management, are consistent with the business and financial substance that have made and continue to make him an independent director. In making its determination with respect to Mr. Gates, the Governance Committee considered that Mr. Gates and his wife are trustees of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (“Gates
Foundation”) that since 2006 has received donations from Warren Buffett of 184,875,314 Class B shares of the Corporation. These shares were received in connection with Mr. Buffett’s pledge to donate Class B Stock to the Gates
Foundation over the remainder of Mr. Buffett’s life. Terms of his pledge are described on Berkshire’s website at www.berkshirehathaway.com under the heading “Letters from Warren E. Buffett Regarding Pledges to Make Gifts
of Berkshire Stock.” The Governance Committee considered these relationships in light of the attributes it believes need to be possessed by independent-minded directors, including personal financial substance and a lack of economic dependence
on the Corporation, as well as business wisdom and ownership of Berkshire shares. The Governance Committee concluded that Mr. Gates’ relationship to the Gates Foundation had no impact on his independence and that he continued to qualify as
an independent director. Howard G. Buffett is the son of Warren Buffett. Ronald L. Olson is a partner of the law firm of
Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP. Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP rendered legal services to the Corporation and its subsidiaries in 2014 and has been rendering services in 2015. The Corporation and its subsidiaries paid fees of $7.2 million
to Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP during 2014. Board of Directors’ Leadership Structure and Role in Risk
Oversight Warren E. Buffett is Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. He is
Berkshire’s largest shareholder and owns shares of Berkshire that represent 33.9% of the voting interest and 19.6% of the economic interest. As such he may be deemed to be Berkshire’s controlling shareholder. It is
Mr. Buffett’s opinion that a controlling shareholder who is active in the business, as is currently the case and has been the case for Mr. Buffett for the last 45 years, should hold both roles. This opinion is shared by
Berkshire’s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has not named a lead independent director. Mr. Buffett and
the other members of the Board of Directors extensively discuss succession planning at each meeting of the Board. Upon his death or inability to manage Berkshire, no member of the Buffett family will be involved in managing Berkshire but, as very
substantial Berkshire shareholders, the Buffett family will assist the Board of Directors in picking and overseeing the CEO selected to succeed Mr. Buffett. At that time, Mr. Buffett believes it would be prudent to have a member of the
Buffett family serve as the non-executive Chairman of the Board. Ultimately, however, that decision will be the responsibility of the then Board of Directors. The full Board of Directors has responsibility for general oversight of risks. It receives reports from Mr. Buffett and other members of senior management at least twice a year on areas of risk
facing the Corporation. Also, at least once a year, the senior management of each of the Corporation’s significant businesses reports to the Board of Directors on risks facing their respective businesses. In addition, as part of its charter,
the Audit Committee discusses Berkshire’s policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. Board of
Directors’ Meetings Board of Directors’ actions were taken in 2014 at the Annual Meeting of Directors that
followed the 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and at two special meetings and upon one occasion by directors’ unanimous written consent. Each then current director attended all meetings of the Board and of the Committees of the Board on
which he or she served except that David S. Gottesman did not attend either special meeting of the Board of Directors. Directors are encouraged but not required to attend annual meetings of the Corporation’s shareholders. All directors of the
Corporation attended the 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 4 Meetings of Non-Management and Independent Directors Two meetings of non-management directors were held during 2014. Mr. Ronald L. Olson presided as ad hoc chair of the meetings. In
addition, following one of the meetings of non-management directors, a meeting of directors determined to be independent was held. Mr. Walter Scott, Jr. presided as ad hoc chair of that meeting. A shareholder or other interested party wishing
to contact the non-management directors or independent directors, as applicable, should send a letter to the Secretary of the Corporation at 3555 Farnam Street, Omaha, NE 68131. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation that the
enclosed letter is to be forwarded to the Corporation’s non-management directors or independent directors, as applicable. Board of Directors’ Committees The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During 2014, the Audit Committee consisted of Susan L. Decker,
Charlotte Guyman, Donald R. Keough and Thomas S. Murphy. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Murphy and Ms. Decker are each an “audit committee financial expert” as that term is used in Item 401(h) of Regulation
S-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act. All current members of the Audit Committee meet the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act and in Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange Listed
Company Manual. The Audit Committee assists the Board with oversight of a) the integrity of the Corporation’s financial statements, b) the Corporation’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and c) the qualifications and
independence of the Corporation’s independent public accountants and the Corporation’s internal audit function. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the Corporation’s independent public accountants, Director of Internal
Auditing and members of management and reviews the Corporation’s accounting policies and internal controls. The Audit Committee also selects the firm of independent public accountants to be retained by the Corporation to perform the audit. The
Audit Committee held six meetings during 2014. The Board of Directors adopted an Audit Committee Charter on April 29, 2000, which was subsequently amended and restated on March 2, 2004. The amended Audit Committee Charter is available on
Berkshire’s website at www.berkshirehathaway.com . The Board of Directors has established a Governance Committee
and adopted a Charter to define and outline the responsibilities of its members. A copy of the Governance Committee’s Charter is available on Berkshire’s website at www.berkshirehathaway.com . The Governance Committee
consists of Susan L. Decker, David S. Gottesman, Walter Scott, Jr. and Meryl B. Witmer, all of whom are independent directors in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange director independence standards. The role of the Governance Committee is to assist the Board of Directors by a) recommending governance guidelines applicable to Berkshire;
b) identifying, evaluating and recommending the nomination of Board members; c) setting the compensation of Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer and performing other compensation oversight; d) reviewing related persons transactions and e)
assisting the Board with other related tasks, as assigned from time to time. The Governance Committee met twice during 2014. Director Nominations Berkshire does not have a policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying nominees for director. In identifying director nominees, the Governance Committee does not seek diversity, however
defined. Instead, as previously discussed, the Governance Committee looks for individuals who have very high integrity, business savvy, an owner-oriented attitude and a deep genuine interest in the Company. With respect to the selection of director
nominees at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Governance Committee recommends the Board nominate each of the 12 directors currently serving on the Board. Berkshire’s Governance Committee has a policy under which it will consider recommendations presented by shareholders. A shareholder wishing to submit such a recommendation should send a letter
to the Secretary of the Corporation at 3555 Farnam Street, Omaha, NE 68131. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation that the enclosed letter is a “Director Nominee Recommendation.” The Secretary must receive the recommendation
by December 14, 2015, for it to be considered by the Committee for the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The letter must identify the author as a shareholder and provide a brief summary of the candidate’s qualifications. At a minimum,
candidates recommended for nomination to the Board of Directors must meet the director independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The Governance Committee’s policy provides that candidates recommended by shareholders will be
evaluated using the same criteria as are applied to all other candidates. Director Compensation Directors of the Corporation or its subsidiaries who are employees or spouses of employees do not receive fees for attendance at
directors’ meetings. A director who is not an employee or a spouse of an employee receives a fee of $900 for each meeting attended in person and $300 for participating in any meeting conducted by telephone. A director who serves as a member of
the Audit Committee receives a fee of $1,000 quarterly. Directors are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of directors or shareholders. The Company does not provide directors and officers liability insurance to
its directors. 5 The following table provides compensation information for the year ended December 31,
2014 for each non-management member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors. Fees Earned or Paid in Cash Total Howard G. Buffett $ 2,700 $ 2,700 Stephen B. Burke 2,700 2,700 Susan L.

compensation committee of any entity for which a member of our Board of Directors or Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee served as an executive officer. Communications with the Board of Directors Shareholders and other
interested parties who wish to communicate with the Board of Directors or a particular director may send a letter to the Secretary of the Corporation at 3555 Farnam Street, Omaha, NE 68131. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation
indicating that the enclosed letter is a “Board Communication” or “Director Communication.” All such letters must clearly state whether the intended recipients are all members of the Board or just certain specified individual
directors. The Secretary will make copies of all such letters and circulate them to the appropriate director or directors. Corporate Governance Guidelines The Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines to promote effective governance of the Corporation. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Berkshire’s website at www.berkshirehathaway.com . Code of Business Conduct and Ethics The Corporation has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for all Berkshire directors, officers and employees as well as
directors, officers and employees of each of its subsidiaries. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on Berkshire’s website at www.berkshirehathaway.com . Related Persons Transactions The Charter of the Governance Committee includes procedures for the approval or ratification of any Related Persons Transaction (“Transaction”) as defined in the regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The procedures require that all requests for approval of proposed Transactions or ratification of Transactions be referred to the Chairman of the Governance Committee or directly to the full committee. The full committee
reviews any Transaction which the Chairman concludes is material to the Company or which the Chairman is unable to review. Only Transactions which the Governance Committee or its Chairman finds to be in the best interests of Berkshire and its
stockholders are approved or ratified. The Chairman reports all Transactions which he reviews to the Governance Committee annually for ratification. Berkshire is not aware of any Transaction entered into since January 1, 2014, or currently
proposed, in which a Related Person had, or will have, a direct or indirect material interest. 6 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management Warren E. Buffett, whose address is 3555 Farnam Street, Omaha, NE 68131, is a nominee for director and the only

(1) Beneficial owners exercise both sole voting and sole investment power unless otherwise stated. Each share of Class A Stock is convertible into
1,500 shares of Class B Stock at the option of the shareholder. As a result, pursuant to Rule 13d-3(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a shareholder is deemed to have beneficial ownership of the shares of Class B Stock which such
shareholder may acquire upon conversion of the Class A Stock. In order to avoid overstatement, the amount of Class B Stock beneficially owned does not take into account such shares of Class B Stock which may be acquired upon conversion (an
amount which is equal to 1,500 times the number of shares of Class A Stock held by a shareholder). The percentage of outstanding Class B Stock is based on the total number of shares of Class B Stock outstanding as of March 4, 2015 and
does not take into account shares of Class B Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Class A Stock. (2) Mr. Buffett has entered into a voting agreement with Berkshire providing that, should the combined voting power of Berkshire shares as to which
Mr. Buffett has or shares voting and investment power exceed 49.9% of Berkshire’s total voting power, he will vote those shares in excess of that percentage proportionately with votes of the other Berkshire shareholders. (3) Includes 859 Class A shares and 403,189 Class B shares held by a private foundation for which Mr. Buffett possesses voting and investment
power but with respect to which he disclaims any beneficial interest. (4) Includes 4,050 Class A shares held by a single-member limited liability company of which Mr. Gates is the sole member and 76,985,314 Class
B shares owned by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust of which Mr. Gates and his wife are co-trustees but with respect to which Mr. and Mrs. Gates disclaim any beneficial interest. (5) Includes 11,685 Class A shares and 2,433,378 Class B shares as to which Mr. Gottesman or his wife has shared voting power and 9,347
Class A shares and 2,406,684 Class B shares as to which Mr. Gottesman or his wife has shared investment power. Mr. Gottesman has a pecuniary interest in 6,425 Class A shares and 395 Class B shares included herein. (6) Includes 67 Class A shares and 26,968 Class B shares owned by three trusts for which Mr. Murphy is a trustee and the beneficiary. (7) Includes 195 Class A shares and 400 Class B shares held by four trusts for which Mr. Olson is a trustee but with respect to which
Mr. Olson disclaims any beneficial interest. (8) Does not include 2 Class A shares owned by Ms. Witmer’s husband and 2 Class A shares owned by her two children. 7 Compensation Discussion and Analysis Berkshire’s program regarding compensation of its executive officers is different from most public company programs.
Mr. Buffett’s and Mr. Munger’s compensation is reviewed annually by the Governance Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors. Due to Mr. Buffett’s and Mr. Munger’s desire that their compensation
remain unchanged, the Committee has not proposed an increase in Mr. Buffett’s or Mr. Munger’s compensation since the Committee was created in 2004. Prior to that time Mr. Buffett recommended to the Board of Directors the
amount of his compensation and Mr. Munger’s. Mr. Buffett’s and Mr. Munger’s annual compensation has each been $100,000 for more than 25 years and Mr. Buffett has advised the Committee that he would not expect or
desire such compensation to increase in the future. The Committee has established a policy that: (i) neither the
profitability of Berkshire nor the market value of its stock are to be considered in the compensation of any executive officer; and (ii) all compensation paid to executive officers of Berkshire be deductible under Internal Revenue Code
Section 162(m). Under the Committee’s compensation policy, Berkshire does not grant stock options to executive officers. The Committee has delegated to Mr. Buffett the responsibility for setting the compensation of Mr. Hamburg,
Berkshire’s Senior Vice President/Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Buffett will on occasion utilize Berkshire personnel
and/or have Berkshire pay for minor items such as postage or phone calls that are personal. Mr. Buffett reimburses Berkshire for these costs by making an annual payment to Berkshire in an amount that is equal to or greater than the costs that
Berkshire has incurred on his behalf. During 2014, Mr. Buffett reimbursed Berkshire $50,000. Berkshire provides personal and home security services for Mr. Buffett. The cost for these services was $364,011 in 2014 and is reflected in the
Summary Compensation Table as a component of Mr. Buffett’s “All Other Compensation.” It should be noted that many large companies maintain security departments that provide costly services to top executives but for which no
itemization is provided in their proxy statements. Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger do not use Company cars or belong to clubs to which the Company pays dues. It should also be noted that neither Mr. Buffett nor Mr. Munger utilizes
corporate-owned aircraft for personal use. Each of them is personally a fractional NetJets owner, paying standard rates, and they use Berkshire-owned aircraft for business purposes only. Factors considered by Mr. Buffett in setting Mr. Hamburg’s salary are typically subjective, such as his perception of
Mr. Hamburg’s performance and any changes in functional responsibility. Mr. Buffett also sets the compensation for each of the CEO’s of Berkshire’s significant operating businesses. He utilizes many different incentive
arrangements, with their terms dependent on such elements as the economic potential or capital intensity of the business. The incentives can be large and are always tied to the operating results for which the CEO has authority. These incentives are
related to measures over which the CEO has control. The following table discloses the compensation received for the three
years ended December 31, 2014 by the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, its other executive officer and its Chief Financial Officer.

Shareholder Meeting Schedule 14A Proxy Statement, filed pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Proxy”). Based on the review and discussion referred to on page 8, we recommend that the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company’s Proxy. Submitted by the members of the Governance, Compensation and
Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors. Walter Scott, Jr., Chairman David S. Gottesman Susan L. Decker Meryl B. Witmer Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Corporation’s officers and directors, and persons who own more
than 10% of a registered class of the Corporation’s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. Officers, directors and greater than
ten-percent shareholders are required by the regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission to furnish the Corporation with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it,
and written representations from certain reporting persons that no Section 16(a) forms were required for those persons, the Corporation believes that during 2014 all filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than
ten-percent shareholders were complied with except as follows. Mr. Murphy filed a Form 5 on February 13, 2015 which disclosed that two purchases of Class B shares in April 2014 by trusts of which Mr. Murphy is a trustee and
beneficiary were not reported on a Form 4 when due. Independent Public Accountants Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) served as the Corporation’s principal independent public accountants for 2014.
Representatives from that firm will be present at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to any appropriate questions. The Corporation has not selected
independent public accountants for the current year, since its normal practice is for the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to make such selection later in the year. The following table shows the fees paid or accrued for audit services and
fees paid for audit-related, tax and all other services rendered by Deloitte for each of the last two years (in millions): 2014 2013 Audit Fees (a) $ 32.5 $ 30.7 Audit-Related Fees (b) 2.1 1.8 Tax Fees (c) 0.9 1.2 $ 35.5 $ 33.7 (a) Audit fees include fees for the audit of the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and interim reviews of the Corporation’s quarterly financial
statements, audit services provided in connection with required statutory audits of many of the Corporation’s insurance subsidiaries and certain of its non-insurance subsidiaries and comfort letters, consents and other services related to
Securities and Exchange Commission matters. (b) Audit-related fees primarily include fees for certain audits of subsidiaries not required for purposes of Deloitte’s audit of the Corporation’s
consolidated financial statements or for any other statutory or regulatory requirements, audits of certain subsidiary employee benefit plans and consultations on various accounting and reporting matters. (c) Tax fees include fees for services relating to tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice. These services include assistance regarding federal, state and
international tax compliance, tax return preparation and tax audits. The Audit Committee has considered
whether the non-audit services provided to the Company by Deloitte impaired the independence of Deloitte and concluded that they did not. All of the services performed by Deloitte were pre-approved in accordance with the pre-approval policy adopted by the Audit Committee on May 5, 2003. The policy provides guidelines for audit, audit
related, tax and other non-audit services that may be provided by Deloitte to the Company. The policy (a) identifies the guiding principles that must be considered by the Audit Committee in approving services to ensure that Deloitte’s
independence is not impaired; (b) describes the audit, audit-related and tax services that may be provided and the non-audit services that are prohibited; and (c) sets forth pre-approval requirements for all permitted services. Under the
policy, requests to provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Company’s independent auditor and its Chief Financial Officer. All requests for services to be
provided by the independent auditor that do not require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and must include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The Chief
Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such services rendered
by the independent auditor. 9 Report of the Audit Committee February 24, 2015 To the Board of
Directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. We have reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation
and its subsidiaries to be set forth in the Corporation’s 2014 Annual Report to Shareholders and at Item 8 of the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 with management of the Corporation
and Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent public accountants for the Corporation. We have discussed with
Deloitte & Touche LLP the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), as adopted in Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communications with Audit Committees). We have received the
written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP required by the applicable PCAOB requirements for independent accountant communications with audit committees with respect to auditor independence and have discussed with
Deloitte & Touche LLP its independence from the Corporation. It is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or
conduct audits or to determine that the Corporation’s financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; that is the responsibility of management and the Corporation’s
independent public accountants. In giving its recommendation to the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee has relied on (i) management’s representation that such financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and (ii) the reports of the Corporation’s independent public accountants with respect to such financial statements. Based on the review and discussions with management of the Corporation and Deloitte & Touche LLP referred to above, we recommend
to the Board of Directors that the Corporation publish the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation and subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2014 in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the
Corporation’s 2014 Annual Report to Shareholders. Submitted by the members of the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors. Thomas S. Murphy, Chairman Charlotte Guyman Susan L. Decker 2. OTHER MATTERS As of the
