The non-employee directors’ compensation plan year begins on March 1 of each year (the “Plan Year”). Summary of Non-Employee Director Annual Compensation for the 2020 Plan Year The table below sets forth the annual retainer, equity grants and committee premiums for the non-employee directors and the Non-Executive Chairperson for the 2020 Plan Year. Each non-employee director may elect to defer all or part of the cash compensation to the 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (“Director Deferral Plan”). Any deferred cash compensation is converted into shares of our common stock.

(3) The stock is granted on the later of (i) March 1 or (ii) the first trading day after each annual meeting of stockholders. The number of shares underlying the stock grant is determined by dividing $225,000 by the average fair market value of our common stock over 20 consecutive trading days up to and including the day prior to the grant date. The stock grant vests immediately upon grant and may be deferred pursuant to the Director Deferral Plan. A non-employee director who joins the Board after the start of the Plan Year will have his or her cash retainer, equity grant and committee premium pro-rated based upon the remaining days in the Plan Year that the director will serve. 11 COMPENSATION OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS Non-Employee Director Compensation for Fiscal Year 2020 The table below sets forth information regarding the compensation earned by each of our non-employee directors during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020: Cash Non-Executive Committee Audit Committee Stock Retainer (1) Chair Retainer (1) Chair Retainer (1) Member Retainer (1) Awards (2)(3) Total Name ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) Mala Anand 94,445 – – 245,094 339,539 Hans E.

For more information regarding our application of  ASC Topic 718, including the assumptions used in the calculations of these amounts, please refer to Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. The dollar values of the stock awards represent stock grants of 3,081 shares for each non-employee director. (3) Stock Awards granted to non-employee directors vest immediately upon grant. Therefore, there are no unvested stock awards outstanding at fiscal year-end. (4) Mr. Koh has served as the Non-Executive Chairperson of the Board since March 15, 2017. Non-Employee Director Reimbursement Non-employee directors are reimbursed for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their service on our Board. Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines Non-employee directors are required to own shares of our common stock having a value of at least six times an amount equal to the annual cash retainer. The shares counted toward the ownership guidelines include shares owned outright and the shares of our common stock in the non-employee director’s deferred compensation account. For recently appointed non-employee directors, these ownership levels must be attained within five years from the date of their initial election or appointment to the Board of Directors. All of our incumbent non-employee directors have either achieved the recommended ownership level or are expected to achieve the recommended ownership level within five years of their initial election or appointment to our Board. 12 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE We have had formal corporate governance standards in place since our inception in 1999. We have reviewed internally and with the Board the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the New York Stock Exchange’s (“NYSE”) corporate governance listing standards regarding corporate governance policies and processes and are in compliance with the rules and listing standards. We have adopted charters for our Audit and Finance Committee, Compensation Committee, Executive Committee and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee consistent with the applicable rules and standards.  Our committee charters, Amended and Restated Corporate Governance Standards and Standards of Business Conduct are located in the Investor Relations section of our website and can be accessed by clicking on “Committee Charters” or “Governance Documents” in the “Governance” section of our web page at www.investor.agilent.com. Board Leadership Structure We currently separate the positions of chief executive officer and chairperson of the Board. Mr. Koh was appointed chairperson of the Board in March 2017. The responsibilities of the chairperson of the Board include: setting the agenda for each Board meeting in consultation with the chief executive officer; chairing the meetings of independent directors; and facilitating and conducting, with the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, the annual self-assessments by the Board and each standing committee of the Board, including periodic performance reviews of individual directors. Separating the positions of chief executive officer and chairperson of the Board allows our chief executive officer to focus on our day-to-day business, while allowing the chairperson of the Board to lead the Board in its fundamental role of providing advice to and independent oversight of management. The Board believes that having an independent director serve as chairperson of the Board is the appropriate leadership structure for the company at this time. However, our Corporate Governance Standards permit the roles of the chairperson of the Board and the chief executive officer to be filled by the same or different individuals. This provides the Board with flexibility to determine whether the two roles should be combined in the future based on our needs and the Board’s assessment of our leadership from time to time. Our Corporate Governance Standards provide that in the event that the chairperson of the Board is also the chief executive officer, the Board may consider the election of an independent Board member as a lead independent director. In 2014, we amended the Corporate Governance Standards to raise the mandatory retirement age for directors from 72 to 75, which may be waived by the Board. The Board made the change in recognition of the contribution that experienced directors, with knowledge of the company, bring to effective Board oversight. Board’s Role in Risk Oversight The Board executes its risk management responsibility directly and through its committees. The full Board is kept abreast of risk oversight and other activities of its committees through reports of the committee chairpersons to the full Board during Board meetings. The Audit and Finance Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing our enterprise risk management process. The Audit and Finance Committee receives updates and discusses individual and overall risk areas during its meetings, including our financial risk assessments, risk management policies and major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Compensation Committee oversees risks associated with our compensation policies and practices with respect to both executive compensation and compensation generally. The Compensation Committee receives reports and discusses whether our compensation policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. Majority Voting for Directors Our Bylaws provide for majority voting of directors regarding director elections. In an uncontested election, any nominee for director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to the director. A “majority of the votes cast” means that the number of shares voted “FOR” a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director. The “votes cast” 13 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE shall include votes to withhold authority and exclude votes to “ABSTAIN” with respect to that director’s election. If a director is not elected due to a failure to receive a majority of the votes cast and his or her successor is not otherwise elected and qualified, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will consider the resignation offer and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee’s recommendation within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. Thereafter, the Board will promptly disclose their decision and the rationale behind it in a press release to be disseminated in the same manner as company press releases typically are distributed. Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer. B oard Communications Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board and our Non-Executive Chairperson of the Board of Directors by filling out the form at “Contact Chairperson” under “Governance” at www.investor.agilent.com or by writing to Koh Boon Hwee, c/o Agilent Technologies, Inc., General Counsel, 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd., MS 1A-11, Santa Clara, California 95051. The General Counsel will perform a legal review in the normal discharge of duties to ensure that communications forwarded to the Non-Executive Chairperson preserve the integrity of the process. For example, items that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board such as spam, junk mail and mass mailings, product complaints, personal employee complaints, product inquiries, new product suggestions, resumes and other forms of job inquiries, surveys, business solicitations or advertisements (the “Unrelated Items”) will not be forwarded to the Non-Executive Chairperson. In addition, material that is unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or similarly unsuitable will not be forwarded to the Non-Executive Chairperson. Any communication that is relevant to the conduct of our business and is not forwarded will be retained for one year (other than Unrelated Items) and made available to the Non-Executive Chairperson and any other independent director on request. The independent directors grant the General Counsel discretion to decide what correspondence shall be shared with our management and specifically instruct that any personal employee complaints be forwarded to our Human Resources Department. Director Stockholder Meeting Attendance We encourage, but do not require, our Board members to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. Director Independence We have adopted standards for director independence in compliance with the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. These independence standards are set forth in our Corporate Governance Standards. The Board has affirmatively determined that all of our directors meet these independence standards with the exception of Michael R. McMullen because of his role as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our non-employee directors meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management. The Non-Executive Chairperson of the Board presides at executive sessions of the non-employee directors. Compensation Committee Member Independence We have adopted standards for compensation committee member independence in compliance with the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. In affirmatively determining the independence of any director who will serve on the compensation committee, the Board of Directors considers all factors specifically relevant to determining whether such director has a relationship to the company or any of its subsidiaries which is material to such director’s ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including, but not limited to: • the source of compensation of such director, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by the company to such director; and • whether such director is affiliated with the company or a subsidiary of the company. 14 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Director Nomination Criteria: Qualifications and Experience The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates for nomination by stockholders, provided that the recommendations are made in accordance with the procedures described in the section entitled “General Information” located at the end of this proxy statement. Candidates recommended for nomination by stockholders that comply with these procedures will receive the same consideration as other candidates recommended by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. We typically hire a third-party search firm to help identify and facilitate the screening and interview process of candidates for director. To be considered by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, a director candidate must have: • a reputation for personal and professional integrity and ethics; • executive or similar policy-making experience in relevant business or technology areas or national prominence in an academic, government or other relevant field; • breadth of experience; • soundness of judgment; • the ability to make independent, analytical inquiries; • the willingness and ability to devote the time required to perform Board activities adequately; • the ability to represent the total corporate interests of the company; and • the ability to represent the long-term interests of stockholders as a whole. In addition to these minimum requirements, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will also consider whether the candidate’s skills are complementary to the existing Board members’ skills; the diversity of the Board in factors such as age, experience in technology, manufacturing, finance and marketing, international experience and culture; and the Board’s needs for specific operational, management or other expertise. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee from time to time reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of board members, including factors that it seeks in board members such as diversity of business experience, viewpoints and, personal background, and diversity of skills in technology, finance, marketing, international business, financial reporting and other areas that are expected to contribute to an effective Board of Directors. In evaluating potential candidates for the Board of Directors, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considers these factors in the light of the specific needs of the Board of Directors at that time. The search firm screens the candidates, does reference checks, prepares a biography of each candidate for the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee to review and helps set up interviews. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee and our Chief Executive Officer interview candidates that meet the criteria, and the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee selects candidates that best suit the Board’s needs.  We do not use a third-party to evaluate current Board members. Our Bylaws provide a proxy access right for stockholders, pursuant to which a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least three percent of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years, may nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two individuals or twenty percent of the Board, subject to certain limitations and provided that the stockholders and the nominees satisfy the requirements specified in our Bylaws. 15 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Committees of the Board of Directors Our Board met seven times in fiscal 2020.

In addition, we have adopted a written Related Person Transactions Policy and Procedures (the “Related Person Transactions Policy”) that prohibits any of our executive officers, directors or any of their immediate family members from entering into a transaction with the company, except in accordance with the policy. For purposes of the policy, a “related person transaction” includes any transaction involving the company and any related person that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. Our Related Person Transactions Policy provides that the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee or, at the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee’s request, the disinterested members of the Board review related person transactions in accordance with the terms of the policy. In making the determination whether to approve or ratify a transaction, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee or the disinterested members of the Board shall consider all relevant available information and, as appropriate, must take into consideration the following: • the size of the transaction and the amount payable to the related person; • the nature of the interest of the related person in the transaction; • whether the transaction may involve a conflict of interest; and • whether the transaction involves the provision of goods or services to the company that are available from unaffiliated third parties and, if so, whether the transaction is on terms and made under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the company as would be available in comparable transactions with or involving unaffiliated third parties. The Related Person Transactions Policy provides for standing pre-approval of the following transactions with related persons: (a) Any transaction with another company at which a related person’s only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer or an equivalent), director or beneficial owner of less than 10% of that company’s shares, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of (i) $1,000,000, or (ii) 2 percent of that company’s total annual revenues. (b) Any charitable contribution, grant or endowment by the company to a charitable organization, foundation or university at which a related person’s only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer or an equivalent), a director or a trustee, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the lesser of $500,000, or 2 percent of the charitable organization’s total annual receipts. We will disclose the terms of related person transactions in our filings with the SEC to the extent required. Transactions with Related Persons We purchase services, supplies, and equipment in the normal course of business from many suppliers and sell or lease products and services to many customers. In some instances, these transactions occur with companies with which members of our management or Board have relationships as directors or executive officers. For transactions entered into during fiscal year 2020, no related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. None of the fiscal year 2020 transactions exceeded or fell outside of the pre-approved thresholds set forth in our Related Person Transactions Policy except for transactions with GRAIL, Inc. (“GRAIL”), the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (“UTSW”), Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (“Varian”) and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (“Vir”). Hans E. Bishop serves as Chief Executive Officer and director of GRAIL, Daniel K. Podolsky, M.D., is the President of UTSW, Dow R. Wilson is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Varian, and George A. Scangos serves as Chief Executive Officer and director of Vir. The members of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, excluding Mr. Bishop, Dr. Podolsky, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Scangos, for their company’s respective transactions only, reviewed, approved and ratified the transactions with GRAIL, UTSW, Varian and Vir in accordance with the policy. 17 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Below is a summary of the aggregate transactions between Agilent and each of GRAIL, UTSW, Varian and Vir that occurred in fiscal 2020 or during the time such Agilent director served as an officer of GRAIL, UTSW, Varian or Vir. • GRAIL, Inc. (“GRAIL”). GRAIL purchased an aggregate of approximately $458,924 of products and/or services from us during fiscal year 2020. • University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (“UTSW”). UTSW, or its affiliates, purchased an aggregate of approximately $498,445 of products and/or services from us during fiscal year 2020. • Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (“Varian”). Varian, or its affiliates, purchased an aggregate of approximately $1,064,171 of products and/or services from us, and Agilent, or its affiliates, purchased an aggregate of approximately $400,000 of products and/or services from Varian during fiscal year 2020. • Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (“Vir”). Vir purchased an aggregate of approximately $203,285 of products and/or services from us during fiscal year 2020. 18 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Dear Stockholder, The COVID-19 pandemic and global economic turmoil tested Agilent in fiscal year 2020 and our company responded. Adjusted operating margins were 23.5% despite slower than planned revenue growth as the company took swift action to rein in costs and operate more efficiently while avoiding COVID-19 related layoffs, base salary cuts for employees or adjustments to any of our incentive programs. Despite external headwinds, the company maintained its quarterly dividend and increased adjusted earnings per share by 5.5% over fiscal year 2019. The leadership team, led by our CEO Mike McMullen, sustained the company’s momentum during a turbulent and uncertain 2020 and continued to expand our product portfolio to extend into adjacent markets to improve the customer experience and to deliver earnings growth to shareholders. Our executive compensation program has not changed significantly in several years as we believe it is working well.  Our executive team is delivering on the most critical short- and long-term strategic priorities for the company as our consistent, strong results and steady increase in stockholder value over the past years indicate. We have maintained ongoing dialog with our stockholders, who support our current executive compensation program and see no need for major changes as evidenced by our Say on Pay vote results and the feedback received in our stockholder outreach efforts. We believe in the value of consistency and plan only minor changes to our executive compensation program for fiscal year 2021. In the Compensation Discussion and Analysis that follows, we discuss our fiscal year 2020 CEO and executive officer compensation in more detail and share additional information about the program refinements we will implement for fiscal year 2021. You will see that our commitment to both pay for performance and clear, transparent disclosure is strong. We encourage you to review this analysis carefully and believe you will agree that our executive compensation program is achieving our objectives of supporting the company’s growth strategy and creating long-term stockholder value. Compensation Committee Tadataka Yamada, M.D., Chairperson Mala Anand Hans E. Bishop Heidi Kunz George A. Scangos, Ph.D. 19 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS COMPENSATION DISCU SSION AND ANALYSIS This section of the proxy statement describes the compensation arrangements for our Named Executive Officers (NEOs) for fiscal year 2020, which were exclusively determined by our independent Compensation Committee and which are further detailed in the 2020 Summary Compensation Table and other compensation tables contained in this proxy statement. This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) also includes additional information on how the Compensation Committee arrived at its fiscal year 2020 compensation decisions for the NEOs and an overview of our executive compensation philosophy and our executive compensation program. Our NEOs for fiscal year 2020 are as follows: • Michael R. McMullen, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) • Robert McMahon, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) • Jacob Thaysen, Senior Vice President, President Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (LSAG) • Sam Raha, Senior Vice President, President Diagnostic and Genomics Group (DGG) • Michael Tang, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary • Mark Doak, Former Senior Vice President, President Agilent Cross Lab Group (ACG) In this CD&A, we provide the following: • Executive Summary • Determining Executive Pay • Fiscal Year 2020 Compensation • Additional Information 20 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Executive Summary Fiscal Year 2020 at a glance: Performance and Compensation Highlights CEO and NEO Compensation • Strong financial performance despite the turbulence caused by COVID-19, including strong EPS growth which created higher stockholder value. • Continued investment in high-growth businesses. • Strong alignment between current executive compensation program and increased stockholder value creation. Total Target Compensation % of Total Target Compensation at Risk McMullen $13,644,000 91% Other NEOs (average) $3,102,800 81% FY20 Executive Compensation Program Highlights Pay for Performance • Made no material changes to program due in part to continued effectiveness and shareholder support. • Maintained operating margin and revenue in short-term incentive program. • Maintained earnings per share and relative TSR in long-term incentive program. • Broadened recoupment policy to cover all executives and to take into account our continued growth in the healthcare sector. • As a result of solid company performance, the Short-Term Incentive program (financial targets) paid out at 69% of target. • 25% of the short-term incentive payout for Agilent’s business presidents is determined based on select key business initiatives (KBIs) approved by the Compensation Committee. These KBIs paid out at 79% on average in fiscal year 2020. Our CEO, CFO and General Counsel were not assigned any KBIs this year. • In fiscal year 2020, the payout % achieved for our LTI-TSR grants was 191% as our relative TSR was at the 73rd percentile of our S&P 500 Health Care and Materials Indexes peer group. The payout % achieved for the LTI-EPS grants was 132% as we exceeded our targets in two of the three -years in the performance period. Stockholder Engagement We are pleased with the 95% support for our 2020 Say-on-Pay proposal and continue to engage with stockholders regarding our executive pay program. In 2020, consistent with prior years, we solicited input from our largest stockholders on our current program, including the minor changes we are planning for fiscal year 2021. 21 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Financial Performance Highlights Year-over-year financial results as compared to fiscal year 2019 results: Measure Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2020 YOY % S&P 500 TSR* 6,138.73 6,734.84 9.7% Agilent TSR* $75.11 $102.09 35.9% Revenue (Actual) $5.2B $5.3B 3.4% Operating Margin 18.2% 15.8% (13.2)% Operating Margin (non-GAAP)** 23.3% 23.5% 0.9% Diluted EPS $3.37 $2.30 (31.8%) Diluted EPS (non-GAAP)** $3.11 $3.28 5.5% * Stock prices shown for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 are as of 10/31/2019 and 10/31/2020 respectively and include reinvested dividends. ** Non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS are further defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Appendix A to this proxy statement. Correlation of CEO Total Direct Compensation to Company Performance The chart below demonstrates how the historical total direct compensation (salary, actual bonus and grant value of equity awards) of our CEO compares to our five-year indexed TSR. The numbers shown as the indexed TSR for each year are based on the dollar amount a stockholder would have held at the end of the indicated fiscal year assuming the stockholder invested $100 in Agilent common stock on October 31, 2015. 22 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Aligning CEO and NEO Pay with Performance For fiscal year 2020, approximately 91% of Mr. McMullen’s and 81% of our other NEOs’ total direct compensation consisted of short-term and long-term incentives and was “at risk”— which means that this component can vary year to year depending on the performance of the company and our stock price performance. Stockholder Outreach We received 95% stockholder support on our 2020 Say-on-Pay proposal, along with support from the major stockholder advisory firms. While pleased with these results, our Compensation Committee and members of management believe ongoing dialog with stockholders regarding executive compensation is crucial. In the summer of 2020, we communicated with many of our largest stockholders to recap our program for fiscal year 2020 and discuss our strategy for fiscal year 2021. The process affirmed our executive compensation program and supported our plan to maintain the current design for fiscal year 2021 with only minor changes. Fiscal Year 2020 Program Highlights For fiscal year 2020, we made no changes to our program other than eliminating the financial planning perquisite for the CEO and other NEOs.  We maintained operating margin and revenue as the financial metrics in the short-term incentive program and earnings per share and relative TSR as our metrics in the long-term incentive program. Fiscal Year 2021 Planned Program Change To further strengthen our executives’ alignment with shareholders, motivate growth and position competitively with our peers, we plan to introduce non-qualified stock options to our long-term incentive mix. 60% of the long-term incentive award will continue to be delivered in long-term performance shares (30% tied to an earnings per share metric and 30% tied to a relative TSR metric); 20% will be delivered in restricted stock units (down from 40% during previous fiscal years); and 20% will be delivered in non-qualified stock options (up from 0% in previous fiscal years). 23 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Determining Executive Pay Our executive pay decisions are grounded in a core philosophy that applies to all elements of compensation. Our compensation philosophy is intended to: • Align executive interests with stockholders; • Support our short- and long-term business strategy; • Deliver competitive total direct compensation targeted, in aggregate, around the 50th percentile of our peers to attract, retain and motivate the best employees; and • Provide pay for performance. The following principal elements of compensation are provided under our executive compensation program: Elements of Pay Base Pay ✓ Baseline for competitive total compensation. ✓ Normally 20% or less of total direct compensation for NEOs. Short-Term Incentives ✓ Focuses executives on critical operating and strategic goals best measured annually. ✓ Provides downside risk for underperformance and upside reward for success. ✓ Leverages financial measures such as revenue and operating margin, supplemented with select strategic initiatives. Long-Term Incentives ✓ The majority of NEO target compensation is performance-based and “at risk”. ✓ Motivates and rewards multi-year stockholder value creation. ✓ Facilitates executive stock ownership. ✓ Enables retention. ✓ Delivered through performance shares and RSUs, both with a mandatory one-year post-vest holding period to encourage long-term orientation. ✓ Performance measures include long-term financial objectives and the relative performance of our stock. Our actual total compensation for each NEO varies based on (i) company performance measured against external metrics that correlate to long-term stockholder value, (ii) performance of the business organizations against specific targets, and (iii) individual performance. These three factors are considered in positioning salaries, determining earned short-term incentives and determining long-term incentive grant values. 24 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Pay Practices Our executive compensation program is supported by a set of strong governance provisions and pay practices. Philosophy / Practice Result We structure compensation to create strong alignment with stockholder interests ✓ Majority of pay is “at risk,” delivered via performance-based vehicles such as long-term performance shares and annual cash incentives. ✓ Robust stock ownership guidelines. ✓ Mandatory one-year post-vest holding period on annual LTI awards. We design our programs to avoid excessive risk taking (1) ✓ Strong recoupment and anti-hedging policies in place. ✓ Annual compensation risk assessment. ✓ Balanced internal and external goals. We follow best practices in executive compensation design ✓ Limited perquisites. ✓ Double trigger on change in control benefit provisions and no tax gross-up agreements. ✓ No dividends / dividend-equivalents on unearned performance awards and unvested stock awards. ✓ No acceleration of vesting of equity awards or LTPP shares upon retirement (shares continue to vest) ✓ Independent Compensation Committee consultant. 1) See Compensation Risk Controls in Additional Information Independent Compensation Committee and Consultant The Compensation Committee is composed solely of independent members of the Board and operates under a Board-approved charter which outlines the Committee’s major duties and responsibilities. This charter is available on our Investor Relations website. Semler Brossy, our independent compensation consultant, does not perform any other work for us, does not trade our stock, has independence policies that are reviewed annually and will proactively notify the Compensation Committee chair of any potential or perceived conflicts of interest. The Compensation Committee found no conflict of interest during fiscal year 2020. For fiscal year 2020, our independent compensation consultant advised the Compensation Committee on several compensation matters, including but not limited to: • Criteria used to identify peer companies for executive compensation and performance metrics; • Evaluation of our total direct compensation levels and mix for the NEOs and four other senior officers; • Mix of long-term incentives, grant types and allocation of equity awards; • Review of the short- and long-term incentive programs for fiscal year 2020; • Review of market trends and governance practices; • Review of various other proposals presented to the Compensation Committee by management; and • Support for stockholder outreach campaign. Process for Determining Compensation To determine total target compensation for the upcoming fiscal year, the Compensation Committee considered: • The performance of each individual executive for the last fiscal year; • The most recent peer group data from our independent compensation consultant; 25 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS • Our short-and long-term business and strategic goals; and • D etailed tally sheets for the CEO and each NEO. Our independent compensation consultant presents and analyzes market data for each individual position and provides insight on market practices for the Compensation Committee’s actions, but it does not make any specific compensation recommendations on the individual NEOs. Our consultant does collaborate with the Committee Chair to develop CEO pay recommendations. The Compensation Committee then determines the form and amount of compensation for all executive officers after considering the market data and company, business unit and individual performance. Peer Group for Executive Compensation Each year, the Compensation Committee meets with our independent compensation consultant to review and approve the peer group companies that satisfy our selection criteria. For fiscal year 2020, our compensation peer group consisted of the 32 companies listed below from the S&P 500 Health Care Index (excluding the Health Care Distributors, Health Care Facilities and Managed Health Care subsectors) with revenues between 0.25x and 2.5x times our projected revenue, supplemented with two of our most direct competitors (Thermo Fisher and Danaher). We also kept prior year peers if those companies were still in the S&P 500 and revenue was within plus or minus 10% of the range. The range of annual revenues for peer group members was determined so that our annual revenue would be around the median of the peer group. We used data from this peer group to set each NEO’s compensation for fiscal year 2020, with aggregate compensation targeted at around the peer group median. • Alexion Pharma • DaVita Healthcare • Lab Corp of America • Teleflex • Align Technology • DENTSPLY Sirona • Mettler-Toledo • Thermo Fisher • Baxter Intl • Edwards Lifesciences • Mylan NV (now Viatris) • Varian Medical Systems • Biogen • Hologic • Perkin Elmer • Vertex Pharma • Boston Scientific • IDEXX Labs • Perrigo • Waters • Celgene • Illumina • Quest Diagnostics • Zimmer • Cerner • Incyte • Regeneron Pharma • Zoetis • Cooper • Intuitive Surgical • ResMed • Danaher • IQVIA • Stryker Peer Group for the Long-Term Performance Program The Compensation Committee believes that an expanded peer group is more appropriate for determining relative TSR under the company’s LTPP, as an expanded peer group better represents a range of alternative investment options for shareholders and reduces the volatility inherent in small comparator groups. Therefore, the Compensation Committee uses the approximately 89 companies in the Health Care and Materials Indexes of the S&P 500 for determining TSR under the LTPP. Only companies that are included in one of these indexes at the beginning of the performance period and which have three years of stock price performance at the end of the performance period are included in the final calculation of results. Any change in the expanded peer group is solely due to Standard & Poor’s criteria for inclusion in the indexes. Role of Management The CEO and the Chief Human Resources Officer consider the responsibilities, performance and capabilities of each of our named executive officers, other than the CEO, and the compensation package they believe will attract, retain and motivate. The Chief Human Resources Officer does not provide input on setting his own compensation. A comprehensive analysis is conducted using a combination of the market data based on our compensation peer group and proxy data, performance against targets, and overall performance assessment. This data is used to determine if an increase in compensation is warranted and the amount and type of any increase for each of the total compensation components for the then-current fiscal year. After consulting with the Chief Human Resources Officer, the CEO makes compensation recommendations, other than for his own compensation, to the Compensation Committee at its first meeting of the fiscal year. 26 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CEO Compensation The Compensation Committee establishes the CEO’s compensation based on a thorough review of the CEO’s performance that includes: • An objective assessment against predetermined metrics set by the Compensation Committee; • Tally sheets; • Market data from our independent compensation consultant; • A self-evaluation by the CEO that the Compensation Committee discusses with the other independent directors; and • A qualitative evaluation of the CEO’s performance that is developed by the independent directors, including each member of the Compensation Committee, in executive session. The Compensation Committee reviews the CEO’s total direct compensation package annually and presents its recommendation to the other independent directors for review and comment before making the final determinations on compensation for the CEO. Fiscal Year 2020 Compensation Base Salary Our salaries reflect the responsibilities of each NEO and the competitive market for comparable professionals in our industry and are set to create an incentive for executives to remain with us. Base salaries and benefits packages are the fixed components of our NEOs’ compensation and do not vary with company performance. Each NEO’s base salary is set by considering market data as well as the performance of each NEO. For fiscal year 2020, our NEOs’ base salaries ranged between the 25th and 75th percentile of our compensation peer group. Mr. Raha received a 10% increase to position his salary closer to the market median after two successful years in his role. Name FY19 Salary FY20 Salary Increase Michael R. McMullen $1,225,000 $1,280,000 4% Robert McMahon $610,000 $650,000 7% Jacob Thaysen $600,000 $625,000 4% Sam Raha $500,000 $550,000 10% Michael Tang $550,000 $570,000 4% Mark Doak $600,000 $630,000 5% Short-Term Cash Incentives The Performance-Based Compensation Plan reflects our pay-for-performance philosophy and directly ties short-term incentives to short-term business performance. These awards are linked to specific annual financial goals and key business initiatives for the overall company and the three business groups (LSAG, ACG and DGG). Annual cash incentives are paid to reward achievement of critical shorter-term operating, financial and strategic measures and goals that are expected to contribute to stockholder value creation over time. Financial goals are pre-established by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the period based on recommendations from management. The financial goals are based on our fiscal year 2020 financial plan established by the Board of Directors and were not changed after they were approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee certifies the calculations of performance against the goals for each period and payouts, if any, are made in cash. For fiscal year 2020, the awards under the Performance-Based Compensation Plan were determined by multiplying the individual’s base salary for the performance period by the individual’s target award percentage and the performance results, as follows: 27 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Financial Goals Annual Salary X Individual Target Bonus % (varies by individual) X Financial Portion of Target Bonus (75% to 100%) X Attainment % (based on actual performance) Key Business Initiatives Annual Salary X Individual Target Bonus % (varies by individual) X Strategic Portion of Target Bonus (0% to 25%) X Attainment % (based on actual performance) Target Award Percentages and FY20 Actual Payouts Our Compensation Committee set the fiscal year 2020 short-term incentive target amounts based on a percent of base salary pre-established for each NEO considering the relative responsibility of each NEO. For fiscal year 2020, short-term incentive target bonuses were set at 130% of base salary for the CEO and either 80% or 70% of base salary for the other NEOs (see chart below). The CEO, CFO and General Counsel were not assigned to key business initiatives for fiscal year 2020. The payouts under the Performance-Based Compensation Plan for fiscal year 2020 are provided in the chart below and in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column in the “Summary Compensation Table.” The overall payout percent compared to target is shown above the actual columns. The payout percentage for Mr. Raha was adjusted from 62% to 51% at the recommendation of the CEO and Compensation Committee due to insufficient progress on an operational objective. Financial Goals and Fiscal Year 2020 Operational Results The Performance-Based Compensation Plan financial goals were based on (1) our adjusted operating margin percentage and our revenue and (2) the operating margin percentage and revenue goals for each of the business units. The Compensation Committee chose those metrics because: • operating margin keeps focus on expense discipline and meeting efficiency measures; and • revenue places focus on delivering strong top-line growth results. The financial targets that must be met to receive the target payout are based on our financial plan. We use a non-GAAP adjusted operating margin that excludes the ongoing impact of certain mergers and acquisitions, currency, hedging and interest costs related to mergers and acquisitions and share buybacks. To determine earned awards, we use payout matrices that link the metrics and reflect threshold-to-maximum opportunities based on various achievement levels of the metrics. No awards are paid 28 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS unless the operating margin percentage threshold is achieved and the maximum award under the plan is capped at 200% of the target award. The target metrics set for our short-term incentives and their corresponding results were as follows: Operating Margin % Revenue $ Threshold Target Max Results Goal Attainment Target (Mil) Max (Mil) Results (Mil) Goal Attainment Payout Percentage (Per Matrix) Agilent 21.0% 24.1% 25.8% 23.7% 98.5% $5,609 $5,890 $5,343 95% 69.2% LSAG 20.4% 23.5% 25.1% 22.9% 97.5% $2,493 $2,617 $2,393 96% 71.6% ACG 23.6% 27.1% 29.0% 27.3% 100.5% $1,992 $2,092 $1,904 96% 81.7% DGG 16.6% 19.1% 20.4% 18.1% 95.0% $1,125 $1,181 $1,045 93% 48.4% * The adjusted non-GAAP operating margin and adjusted non-GAAP revenue measures used in our executive compensation programs may differ from non-GAAP operating margin and GAAP revenue as reported in our quarterly earnings releases as they exclude the ongoing impact of mergers and acquisitions, currency and hedging and reimbursement from Keysight for services. See Appendix A to this proxy statement for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Payout Matrices to Measure Financial Metrics We use payout matrices to determine payout percentages for our fiscal year 2020 short-term incentive program. The payout matrices are designed to reward profitable growth by increasing payout percentages commensurate with increased operating margin and / or revenue achievement as illustrated in the table below. FY20 - Revenue Achievement (% of target) <=93% 97.0% 100.0% 103.0% 105.0% 107% 95% 126% 150% 180% 200% 104% 81% 108% 129% 159% 179% FY20 - OM 100% 63% 84% 100% 130% 150% Achievement 94% 45% 67% 83% 108% 125% (% of target) 87% 25% 46% 63% 82% 95% 86% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Note: This specific payout matrix was used to determine the company level payout percentage. The payout percentage is determined by finding the intersection between goal attainments as a percentage of plan for each financial metric. Payout percentages are assigned to each intersection of revenue and adjusted operating margin percentage throughout the payout matrix. Payouts between the numbers represented in the table above are calculated on a linear payout matrix and the threshold amount for adjusted operating margin percentage must be met in order for a payout to be made. Payout matrices vary by business group. No payouts are awarded for Operating Margin achievement below the 87% threshold. Key Business Initiatives – Targets and Results For fiscal year 2020, under the Performance-Based Compensation Plan, we continued to utilize annual key business initiatives to align NEOs’ objectives with strategic company priorities. These key business initiatives are established at the same time as the financial goals and account for 25% of the total target bonus for each NEO who was assigned to key business initiatives. The maximum payout per NEO for satisfaction of the strategic component is the lesser of (i) up to 200% of key business initiative performance results or (ii) 0.75% of non-GAAP pre-tax earnings for the company, and the Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion in determining the final payout. The key business initiatives were selected to focus NEOs on strategic priorities such as revenue growth in specific markets and products, success of specific acquisitions and regulatory compliance. The following table sets forth (i) each key business initiative and its threshold, target and maximum achievement levels, (ii) the NEOs assigned to each key business initiative, and (iii) the final attainment and payout percentage for each objective. If an NEO is assigned to more than one objective, the weighting is equally distributed. For fiscal year 2020, Messrs. McMullen, McMahon and Tang were not assigned to any key business initiatives. The targets were established with the rigor necessary to drive desired results for each initiative. For competitive purposes, specific threshold, target and maximum amounts are not shown in the descriptions that follow. 29 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Officer Assigned FY20 Key Business Initiative Description Threshold (50%) Target (100%) Maximum (200%) Payout Percentage Messrs. Thaysen and Doak Agilent Biopharma revenue growth 69% of plan Achieve Plan 131% of plan 25% Mr. Thaysen LSAG Acquisition Performance 92% of plan Achieve Plan 108% of plan 66% Mr. Raha DGG China revenue growth DGG eCommerce order growth 50% of plan 50% of plan Achieve Plan Achieve Plan 150% of plan 150% of plan 0% 143% Mr. Doak Agilent eCommerce order growth 81% of plan Achieve Plan 119% of plan 0% Notes: If a NEO is assigned to more than one key business initiative within a category, those initiatives are equally weighted. For foreign exchange conversion purposes, all Orders/Revenue assume the November accounting rate. Actual payout tables for key business initiatives use a straight-line payout slope (and/or key milestones) from threshold to target and from target to maximum. Final payouts for each key business initiative are recommended by the CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee. Long-Term Incentives – Performance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units Performance Stock Units Earned in Fiscal Year 2020 – Relative TSR Fifty percent of the performance stock units granted in fiscal year 2018 for the FY18 to FY20 performance period were measured based on relative TSR versus all companies in the S&P 500 Health Care and Materials Indexes for fiscal years 2018 through 2020. The company did not establish an absolute TSR target as we believe performance is best measured on a relative basis against our selected peer group with the payout percentages as follows: Peer Group TSR Payout Percentage 75 th Percentile 64.8% 200% Median 30.8% 100% 25 th Percentile -0.7% 25% Agilent 60.4% 191% In November 2020, the Compensation Committee certified the relative TSR results for the FY18 to FY20 performance period. Agilent’s strong stock price performance was at the 73 rd percentile of our peer group and resulted in a 191% payout percentage. See table below: Target Awards (Shares) Original Target Award Value ($) Resulting Share Payout % Resulting Share Payout Michael R. McMullen 29,112 2,490,000 191.0% 55,603 Robert McMahon 14,847 1,200,000 191.0% 28,357 Jacob Thaysen 6,442 547,500 191.0% 12,303 Sam Raha 1,454 120,000 191.0% 2,777 Michael Tang 3,858 330,000 191.0% 7,368 Mark Doak 7,190 615,000 191.0% 13,732 Note: The final share amount was determined by multiplying the target award shares by the resulting payout percentage. The target award shares for Messrs. Thaysen and Raha include shares from promotions that occurred during FY18. 30 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Our relative TSR performance (or percentile position) compared to that of our LTPP peer group and the payout percentages for the LTPP for the past five performance periods are set forth below: Note: A 200% payout is achieved when our relative TSR is at or above the 75th percentile of our LTPP-TSR peer group.  Due to the 3x value cap in place for the FY16 to FY18 performance period, the payout was limited to 189%. Performance Stock Units Earned in Fiscal Year 2020 – Earnings Per Share Fifty percent of the performance stock units granted in fiscal year 2018 for the FY18 to FY20 performance period had financial goals based on adjusted earnings per share. The 132% payout percentage earned under these performance stock units was determined by calculating the adjusted earnings per share attained at the end of each of the three fiscal years in the performance period compared to the targets (which were set at the midpoint of external guidance at the beginning of each fiscal year during the three-year performance period). We set our EPS goals on an annual basis to maximize the alignment of the program with our aggressive long-term growth plans. We believe setting EPS targets at the time of grant for the full three-year period risks establishing goals that could be insufficiently aggressive in years two and/or three of the performance period and therefore does not have the intended motivational effect. Annual goal setting is a common practice among our peer companies and we find it has had the intended motivational affect for our executive team.  We use non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, subject to Compensation Committee approval. The payout percentage, which was certified by the Compensation Committee at the November 2020 meeting was a simple average of the payout percentage certified for fiscal year 2018, fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020. The threshold, target, maximum and final attainment numbers are set forth in the table below: Long-Term Performance Shares - EPS Fiscal Year Threshold (25%) Target (100%) Maximum (200%) Actual Adjusted EPS Attainment Percentage FY18 $2.36 $2.53 $2.70 $2.80 200% FY19 $2.80 $3.03 $3.26 $3.09 126% FY20 $3.09 $3.41 $3.73 $3.28 70% Payout 132% * The adjusted non-GAAP EPS measure used in our executive compensation programs for FY18 and FY19 may differ from non-GAAP EPS as reported in our quarterly earnings releases as it excludes the ongoing impact of mergers and acquisitions, currency, hedging and interest costs related to mergers and acquisitions and share buybacks. See Appendix A to this proxy statement for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 31 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS In November 2020, the Compensation Committee certified the LTPP-EPS results for the FY18 to FY20 performance period.

The target award shares for Messrs. Thaysen and Raha include shares from promotions that occurred during FY18. Relative TSR Performance Stock Units – FY19 to FY21 Performance Period Fifty percent of the performance stock units granted in fiscal year 2019 for the FY19 to FY21 performance period had financial goals based on relative TSR versus all companies in the S&P 500 Health Care and Materials Indexes for fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year 2021. Relative TSR performance stock units are completely “at risk” compensation because our performance must be at or above the 25th percentile for the individuals to receive a payout. The final and only payout will be at the end of fiscal year 2021 based on the relative TSR for the three-year performance period. Payout as a Percentage of Relative TSR Performance Target Below 25 th Percentile Rank (threshold) 0% 25 th Percentile Rank 25% 50 th Percentile Rank (target) 100% 75 th Percentile Rank and Above 200% Earnings Per Share Performance Stock Units – FY19 to FY21 Performance Period Fifty percent of the performance stock units granted in fiscal year 2019 for the FY19 to FY21 performance period had financial goals based on adjusted earnings per share. Awards will be determined by calculating the adjusted earnings per share attained at the end of each of the three fiscal years in the performance period compared to the targets (which are set at the beginning of each fiscal year during the three-year performance period). The FY19 and FY20 EPS targets were set at the mid-point of external guidance issued at the beginning of each respective fiscal year. We use non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share and all targets are subject to Compensation Committee approval. The final and only payout will be at the end of fiscal year 2021 based on an average of the payout percentage for each fiscal year. The threshold, target and maximum levels are set forth in the table below: Long-Term Performance Shares - EPS Fiscal Year Threshold (25%) Target (100%) Maximum (200%) Actual Adjusted EPS Attainment Percentage FY19 $2.80 $3.03 $3.26 $3.09 126% FY20 $3.09 $3.41 $3.73 $3.28 70% FY21 TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD Payout TBD * The adjusted non-GAAP EPS measure used in our executive compensation programs may differ from non-GAAP EPS as reported in our quarterly earnings releases as it excludes the ongoing impact of mergers and acquisitions, currency, hedging and interest costs related to mergers and acquisitions and share buybacks.

Restricted stock units make up the other 40% of the target LTI value. Stock grant values were delivered as follows: Equity Vehicle Weighting Metric Vesting Holding Period Methodology for Determining Target Award Payout Range Performance Stock Units 30% Relative Total Shareholder Return 100% after 3 rd year Performance Stock Units 30% Adjusted Earnings Per Share 100% after 3 rd year One-year post-vest holding period Divide the target award amount by the product of the 20-day average stock price, preceding the grant date, multiplied by the applicable accounting valuation 0x to 2X share target Restricted Stock Units 40% None 25% each year over 4 years n/a The target value of the long-term incentive awards is determined at the beginning of the then-current fiscal year for each NEO. The target value reflects the Compensation Committee’s judgment on the relative role of each NEO’s position within the company, as well as the performance of each NEO and benchmark data from our compensation peer group.

The financial goals for the performance stock units for fiscal year 2020 are based on relative TSR and adjusted earnings per share. Relative TSR aligns with stockholder interests as higher TSR results in higher potential returns for stockholders as well as ensuring a correlation between performance and payouts. Adjusted earnings per share ensures our executives are focused on long-term superior earnings growth. As noted above, our fiscal year 2020 short-term incentive program focuses on adjusted operating margin and revenue, which drive internal business strategies that in turn impact our TSR. Relative TSR Performance Stock Units – FY20 to FY22 Performance Period The performance stock units granted in fiscal year 2020 with relative TSR as a metric will be measured and paid out based on relative TSR versus all companies in our LTPP peer group, the Health Care and Materials Indexes of the S&P 500 for fiscal year 2020 through fiscal year 2022. The LTPP peer group companies are established at the beginning of the performance period and need to have three full years of stock price data to be used in the final relative TSR calculation. The company does not establish an absolute 33 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS TSR target as we believe performance is best measured on a relative basis against our selected LTPP peer group. The payout schedule determined by the Compensatio n Committee in fiscal year 2020 was as follows: Payout as a Percentage of Relative TSR Performance Target Below 25 th Percentile Rank (threshold) 0% 25 th Percentile Rank 25% 50 th Percentile Rank (target) 100% 75 th Percentile Rank and Above 200% Relative TSR performance stock units are completely “at risk” compensation because our performance must be at or above the 25th percentile for the individuals to receive a payout. For purposes of determining the relative TSR awards, relative TSR reflects (i) the aggregate change in the 20-day average closing price of our stock versus each of the companies in our LTPP peer group, each as measured at the beginning and end of the three-year performance period plus (ii) the value (if any) returned to stockholders in the form of dividends or similar distributions, assumed to be reinvested on distribution date on a pre-tax basis. Earnings Per Share Performance Stock Units – FY20 to FY22 Performance Period The earnings per share performance awards will be determined by calculating the adjusted earnings per share attained at the end of each of the three fiscal years in the performance period compared to the targets (which are set at the beginning of each fiscal year during the three-year performance period). The fiscal year 2020 EPS targets were set at the mid-point of external guidance issued at the beginning of each respective fiscal year. We use non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share and all targets are subject to Compensation Committee approval. The final and only payout will be at the end of fiscal year 2022 based on an average of the payout percentage for each fiscal year. The threshold, target and maximum levels are set forth in the table below: Long-Term Performance Shares - EPS Fiscal Year Threshold (25%) Target (100%) Maximum (200%) Actual Adjusted EPS Attainment Percentage FY20 $3.09 $3.41 $3.73 $3.28 70% FY21 TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD FY22 TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD Payout TBD * The non-GAAP EPS measure used in our executive compensation programs may differ from non-GAAP EPS as reported in our quarterly earnings releases as it excludes the ongoing impact of mergers and acquisitions, currency, hedging and interest costs related to mergers and acquisitions and share buybacks. See Appendix A to this proxy statement for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Additional Information Equity Grant Practices The Compensation Committee generally makes grants of stock awards to our NEOs at the first Compensation Committee meeting of our fiscal year. Awards are neither timed to relate to the price of our stock nor to correspond with the release of material non-public information, although grants are generally made when our trading window is open. Grants to current employees are generally effective on the date of the Compensation Committee meeting approving such grants. Grants to new employees, including potential NEOs, are typically made at the next regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meeting following the employee’s start date. The standard vesting schedule for our equity grants is 100% after the third year for performance stock units and 25% per year over four years for restricted stock units. Starting in fiscal year 2016, awards granted to executive level employees and above are also subject to a one-year post-vest holding period. For stock awards issued prior to fiscal year 2019, when an employee retires after age 55 with 15 years of service, his or her stock options and stock awards continue to vest per their original vesting schedule rather than accelerate at termination and such 34 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS employee is eligible to receive the full amount paid out under his or her performance stock units at the end of the applicable performance period, assuming such retirement occurs after the 12-month anniversary of the date of grant of the performance stock units. If such retirement occurs during the first 12 months of the date of grant of the performance stock units, the employee would be eligible to receive a pro rata portion of the amount paid out under his or her performance stock units at the end of the applicable performance period. Effective with awards issued after October 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee modified the formula to qualify for continued vesting of awards as outlined above. The new formula requires that an employee voluntarily terminate his or her employment after age 60 and that the combination of the employee’s age plus years of service is 75 or greater. We believe continued vesting into retirement better aligns NEO interests with stockholders beyond the date such NEO retires from the company. As of October 31, 20 20 , M r. McMullen met the eligibility requirements for continued vesting upon retirement under the rule in effect through fiscal year 2018, while as of October 31, 20 20 none of our active NEOs met the eligibility criteria for continued vesting of equity awards . Mr. Doak met the eligibility criteria for continued vesting of equity awards when he retired in May 2020. Stock options and stock awards vest on a “double-trigger” basis in connection with a change in control as described below.  Finally, if an employee dies or becomes fully disabled, his or her unvested stock options or stock awards fully vest. Compensation Risk Controls Semler Brossy, our independent compensation consultant, collaborates with management to conduct an annual review of our compensation-related risks. The risk assessment conducted during fiscal year 2020 did not identify any significant compensation-related risks and concluded that our compensation program is well designed to encourage behaviors aligned with the long-term interests of stockholders. Semler Brossy also found an appropriate balance in fixed versus variable pay, cash and equity, corporate, business unit, and individual goals, financial and non-financial performance measures, and formulas and discretion. Finally, it was determined that there are appropriate policies and controls in place to mitigate compensation-related risk, including the following: Recoupment Policy We maintain an Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy that applies to all our executives and former executives who leave the company after September 16, 2020. Under this Policy, in the event of a material restatement of financial results (wherein results were incorrect at the time published due to mistake, fraud or other misconduct), the Compensation Committee will review all short and long-term incentive compensation awards that were paid or awarded to executives for performance periods beginning after July 14, 2009 (in the case of executive officers covered by Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act) or September 16, 2020 (in the case of other executives) that occurred, in whole or in part, during the restatement period. Additionally, under this Policy, in the case of fraud or misconduct by an executive, including breach of any regulatory standards that have resulted in significant negative impact on our results or operations or market capitalization, the Compensation Committee will consider actions to remedy the misconduct, prevent its recurrence, and impose discipline on the wrongdoers, in each case, as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate.  These actions may include, without limitation: • requiring reimbursement of compensation; • the cancellation of outstanding restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, deferred stock awards, stock options, and other equity incentive awards; • limiting future awards or compensation; and • requiring the disgorgement of profits realized from the sale of our stock to the extent such profit resulted from fraud or misconduct. Insider Trading and Hedging Policy Our insider trading policy, which applies to officers, directors and employees considered insiders, expressly prohibits purchasing or selling our securities while in possession of material, non-public information, or otherwise using such information for their personal benefit. Our insider trading policy further prohibits officers, directors and employees considered insiders from engaging in hedging transactions, such as purchasing or writing derivative securities including puts and calls and entering into short sales or short 35 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS positions with respect to our stock. Directors and executive officers are prohibited from buying our stock on margin or pledging owned Agilent stock as collateral for loans or other indebtedness. Employees, who are not insiders or officers, are generally permitted to engage in transactions designed to hedge or offset market risk. Our executives and directors are permitted to enter into trading plans that are intended to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act so that they can prudently diversify their asset portfolios and exercise their stock options before expiration. Stock Ownership Guidelines Our stock ownership guidelines are designed to encourage our NEOs and other executive officers to achieve and maintain a significant equity stake in our company and more closely align their interests with those of our stockholders. The guidelines provide that the CEO and CFO and other executive officers should accumulate and hold, within five years from election to his or her position, an investment level in our stock equal to the lesser of a multiple of his or her annual base salary or accumulate a direct ownership of our stock as set forth below: Investment Level = Direct Ownership of Multiple of Annual Agilent Stock Executive Base Salary (# of Shares) CEO 6X N/A CFO 3X 80,000 All other executive officers 3X 40,000 Shares directly owned by the executive officer and their household family members, deferred shares and vested restricted stock units are considered in complying with these guidelines. An annual review is conducted to assess compliance with the guidelines, and at the end of fiscal year 2020, all of our NEOs had either met or were on track to reach their stock ownership guideline requirements within the applicable timeframe. Benefits Our global benefits philosophy is to provide NEOs with protection and security through health and welfare, retirement, disability insurance and life insurance programs. During fiscal year 2020, the CEO and other NEOs were eligible to receive the same benefits that are generally available to our other employees. Generally, it is our Compensation Committee’s philosophy to not provide perquisites to our NEOs except in limited circumstances. In addition, our executive officers can use company drivers to transport themselves and their family members to the airport for personal travel. Lastly, we provided some relocation expenses for Messrs. McMullen and McMahon to facilitate their relocations to the San Francisco Bay Area from New Jersey and Massachusetts, respectively. Mr. McMullen’s relocation benefit ended in fiscal year 2020 and will not continue to fiscal year 2021. Our relocation program is designed to facilitate employee relocations that support our business priorities. It does not provide any payments for loss on the sale of a home or special tax gross-ups. These perquisites are included in the “All other Compensation” column in the “Summary Compensation Table.” Deferred Compensation NEOs on the U.S. payroll are eligible to voluntarily defer base salary, short-term incentives in the form of awards under the Performance-Based Compensation Plan and long-term incentives in the form of stock awards under the LTPP. The deferrals are made through our 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, which is available to all active employees on the US payroll whose total target compensation is greater than or equal to $285,000. This is a common benefit arrangement offered by our peer companies, and our plan does not guarantee above market or a specific rate of return on deferrals. These benefits and an additional description of plan features are set forth in the section entitled “Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation” below and the narrative descriptions accompanying this section. 36 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Retirement and Pension Benefits Our executive officers are entitled to participate in the same defined contribution retirement plan that is generally available to all of our eligible employees. We make matching contributions to eligible participants’ retirement plan accounts based on a percentage of their eligible compensation under applicable rules. We believe that this retirement program permits our executives to save for their retirement in a tax-effective manner. Policy Regarding Compensation in Excess of $1 Million per Year Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to our “covered employees,” which currently include our CEO and the three other most highly compensated NEOs employed at the end of the year (other than our CFO). Our Compensation Committee considers the impact of Section 162(m) in setting and determining executive compensation because it is concerned with the net cost of executive compensation to the company (i.e., taking into account the tax treatment of the compensation), and its ability to effectively administer executive compensation in the long-term interests of stockholders. For fiscal year 2020, short-term cash incentives, restricted stock units and long-term performance stock units were intended to comply with the exception for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) as then in effect. However, to maintain flexibility in rewarding individual performance and contributions, the Compensation Committee will not limit all the amounts paid under all of our compensation programs to just those that qualify for tax deductibility. Further, we cannot guarantee that compensation that was intended to comply with the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) will in fact so qualify. Under the 2017 United States Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), effective for our taxable year beginning November 1, 2018, the exception under Section 162(m) for performance-based compensation will no longer be available, subject to transition relief for certain grandfathered arrangements in effect as of November 2, 2017. In addition, the covered employees will be expanded to include our CFO, and once one of our NEOs is considered a covered employee, the NEO will remain a covered employee so long as he or she receives compensation from us.  As regulatory guidance is issued, the Compensation Committee will continue to assess the full impact of the Tax Act’s changes to Section 162(m) on the Company and our compensation programs. Termination and Change of Control Consistent with the practice of many of our peers, the Compensation Committee adopted change-of-control agreements designed to provide protection to the NEOs so they are not distracted by their personal, professional and financial situations at a time when we need them to remain focused on their responsibilities, our best interests and those of all our stockholders. These agreements provide for a “double-trigger” payout only in the event of a change of control and the executive officer is either terminated from his-or-her position or moved into a position that represents a substantial change in responsibilities within a limited period of time after the transaction (these agreements do not become operative unless both events occur). None of our current officers have change-of-control agreements with an excise tax gross-up clause. Potential payments to our NEOs in the event of a change of control under our existing agreements are reported in the “Termination and Change of Control Table.” In addition, we have a Workforce Management Program in place that is applicable to all employees, including NEOs. Employment security is tied to competitive realities as well as individual results and performance, but from time to time, business circumstances could dictate the need for us to reduce our workforce. The Workforce Management Program is intended to assist employees affected by restructuring by providing transition income in the form of severance benefits. 37 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be “soliciting material,” to be “filed” with the SEC, or to be subject to Regulation 14A or Regulation 14C (other than as provided in Item 407 of Regulation S-K) or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC except to the extent that the company specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) or the Exchange Act. The company’s executive compensation program is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”). The Compensation Committee, which is composed entirely of independent, non-employee directors, is responsible for approving and reporting to the Board on all elements of compensation for the executive officers. In this regard, the Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this proxy statement with management. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020.

Our relocation program does not provide any payments for loss on the sale of a home or special tax gross-ups. When Mr. McMullen was named CEO, and once his management team had been identified, it was decided that it would be in the best interest of the company and its stockholders for Mr. McMullen (and most recently for Mr. McMahon) to relocate to the Bay Area and work at our corporate headquarters located in Santa Clara, one of the costliest housing areas in the U.S. For Messrs. McMullen and McMahon, this entailed permanent relocation from New Jersey and Massachusetts, respectively. To facilitate these moves, each of these NEOs participated in our relocation program. For fiscal year 2020, relocation costs for Messrs. McMullen and McMahon were $17,935 and $15,180 respectively. Those expenses were mortgage subsidies provided by the company under our relocation policy and are intended to facilitate the purchase of a home, with the payments being spread out over a four-year period. See table below for current and future mortgage subsidies.

(3) Amounts reflect the performance shares granted in fiscal year 2017 pursuant to the LTPP for the fiscal years 2017 to 2019 performance period and paid out in November of calendar year 2019. Mr. Doak had elected to defer 4,294 shares into his Deferred Compensation Account. All performance award shares were subject to a one-year post-vest holding period. (4) The market value of these awards is based on the 20-day average closing price of our common stock ending on November 19, 2019, the date of issuance of these shares. 43 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Pension Benefits The following table shows the estimated present value of accumulated benefits, including years of service, payable at normal retirement age (65) to our NEOs under certain pension plans. Messrs. McMahon and Thaysen did not have an interest in any of our pension plans and there were no payments under any of our pension plans to any of our NEOs in fiscal year 2020. To calculate an eligible employee’s years of service, the pension plans will bridge each eligible employee’s service, if any, with Hewlett-Packard Company prior to June 2, 2000 to that eligible employee’s service with us on or after June 2, 2000; the total years of service will reflect employment service from both Hewlett-Packard and us, capped at 30 years of service. The cost of all pension plans set forth below is paid entirely by us. The present value of accumulated benefit is calculated using the assumptions under ASC Topic 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits for the fiscal year end measurement (as of October 31, 2020). The present value is based on a lump sum interest rate of 6%, DPSP rate of return of 7.5% and the “applicable mortality table” described in Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. See also Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020.

Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan The Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan is a closed, defined contribution plan. The Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan was created by Hewlett-Packard and covers participants’ service with Hewlett-Packard before November 1, 1993 and is used as a floor offset for the Retirement Plan for service prior to November 1, 1993. There have been no contributions into the plan since October 31, 1993. For service prior to November 1, 1993 (if any), the benefit due is the greater of (i) the benefit defined by the Retirement Plan formula, or (ii) the annuity value of the Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan account balance. Therefore, for service prior to November 1, 1993, the Retirement Plan guarantees a minimum retirement benefit. Benefits under the Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan are payable at normal retirement age as either (i) a single life annuity for single participants, or (ii) a 50% joint and survivor annuity for married participants. Participants may elect to receive payments at any time following termination or retirement in the above forms or as 75% or 100% joint and survivor annuity, or as a one-time lump sum. 44 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Retirement Plan The Retirement Plan, which was frozen for all participants as of April 30, 2016, was available to all employees hired onto U.S. payroll before November 1, 2014 and guarantees a minimum retirement benefit payable at normal retirement age (the later of age 65 or termination). Benefits were accrued on a monthly basis as a lump sum payable at normal retirement age based on eligible pay and years of service up to a maximum of 30 years as follows: For participants who have fewer than 15 years of service: 11% × target pay at the end of the month PLUS 5% × target pay at the end of the month in excess of 50% of the Social Security Wage Base For participants who have 15 or more years of service: 14% × target pay at the end of the month PLUS 5% × target pay at the end of the month in excess of 50% of the Social Security Wage Base Benefits under the Retirement Plan are payable as either (a) a single life annuity for single participants or as (b) a 50% joint and survivor annuity for married participants. Participants may elect to receive payments at any time following termination or retirement in the above forms or as an actuarially equivalent 75% or 100% joint and survivor annuity, or as a one-time lump sum. Payments made prior to normal retirement age will be reduced in accordance with the plan provisions. Supplemental Benefit Retirement Plan The Supplemental Benefit Retirement Plan, which was frozen for all participants as of April 30, 2016, is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Benefits payable under this plan are equal to the excess of the combined qualified Retirement Plan and Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan amount that would be payable in accordance with the terms of the Retirement Plan disregarding the benefit and compensation limitations imposed pursuant to sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code. Benefits under the Supplemental Benefit Retirement Plan are payable upon termination or retirement as follows: • Accruals prior to January 1, 2005 are paid in a single lump sum in the January following the fiscal year in which the participant takes his or her qualified Retirement Plan benefit. • Accruals after December 31, 2004 are paid based on the date the participant retires or terminates: in January immediately following if retirement or termination occurs during the first six months of the year; or in the following July if retirement or termination occurs during the second six months of the year. Participants will receive a benefit in the form of either five annual installments (if the lump sum value is at least $150,000); or in a single lump sum (if the lump sum value is less than $150,000). Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation For fiscal year 2020, the 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan was available to all active employees on the US payroll with total target cash salary, including the short-term Performance-Based Compensation Plan, greater than or equal to $285,000. There are three types of earnings that may be deferred under the program: 45 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 1. 100% of annual base pay earnings in excess of the IRS qualified plan limit of $285,000 for 2020; 2. 95% of bonus earnings, discretionary and cash compensation paid under the Performance-Based Compensation Plan; and 3. 95% of “at risk” compensation paid out in accordance with the terms of our LTPP. Awards under this program are paid out in the form of our common stock. Deferral elections may be made annually and are part of overall tax planning for many executives. There are several investment options available under the Plan, most of which mirror the investment choices under our tax-qualified 401(k) plan. All investment choices are made by the participant. Based on market performance, dividends and interest are credited to participants’ accounts from the funds that the participant has elected. At the time participation is elected, employees must also elect payout in one of three forms, which can commence upon termination or be delayed by an additional one, two or three years following termination: 1. a single lump sum payment; 2. annual installments over a five to fifteen-year period; or 3. a single lump sum payment in January or July on or after 2022. The company currently provides two types of employer contributions. The first is a matching contribution up to 6% of deferred base pay amounts above the IRS qualified plan limit. The second is a transitional company contribution (DCPTCC) which is a formulaic contribution put in place due to the freeze of the U.S. pension and supplemental benefit retirement plans respectively.  Contributions made by the company to our NEOs are detailed in the table that follows. Payouts are distributed to eligible participants in January of the year following termination, if termination occurs during the first six months of the calendar year. Otherwise, payouts are distributed to eligible participants in July of the year following termination where termination occurs during the second half of the calendar year. No early distributions or withdrawals are allowed. When and if received, a participant in the LTPP may elect to defer his or her shares through our 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan. The LTPP shares are deferred in the form of our common stock only. At the end of the deferral period, the LTPP shares are released to the executive. We have established a rabbi trust as a source of funds to make payments under the non-qualified deferred compensation plan. As of October 31, 2020, the rabbi trust with Fidelity Management Trust Company was fully funded, so there is no need for additional funding. The table below provides information on the non-qualified deferred compensation of the NEOs for fiscal year 2020.

Change of Control Agreements Each NEO has signed a Change of Control Agreement. Under these agreements, in the event that within 24 months after a change of control of the company, the company or its successor terminates the employment of such executive without cause or an event constituting good reason occurs and the executive resigns within three months after such an event, the executive will be entitled to: (i) two times, or solely with respect to the CEO, three times, the sum of such executive’s base salary and target bonus, (ii) payment of $80,000 for medical insurance premiums, (iii) full vesting of all outstanding options and stock awards not subject to performance-based vesting, and (iv) a prorated portion of any bonus. Our change of control agreements do not provide tax gross-ups of parachute payments. Under the current agreements, a “change of control” means the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the sale, exchange, lease or other disposition or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the company to a third party; (ii) a merger or consolidation involving the company in which our stockholders immediately prior to such merger or consolidation are not the owners of more than 75% of the total voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the company after the transaction; (iii) the acquisition of beneficial ownership of at least 25% of the total voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the company by a third person; or (iv) Individuals who, as of Effective Date, constitute the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board. “Good reason” means (i) the reduction of the officer’s rate of pay, other than reductions that apply to employees generally and variable and performance reductions; (ii) reduction in benefits or failure to receive the same benefits as similarly situated employees; (iii) a change in the officer’s duties, responsibilities, authority, job title, or reporting relationships resulting in a significant diminution of position, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) the relocation to a worksite that is more than 35 miles from his or her prior worksite and which increases the distance between such executive’s home and principal office by more than 35 miles, unless executive accepts such relocation opportunity; (v) the failure or refusal of a successor to the company to assume our obligations under the agreement, or (vi) a material breach by the company or any successor to the company of any of the material provisions of the agreement. Under these agreements, “cause” means misconduct, including: (i) conviction of any felony or any crime involving moral turpitude or dishonesty which has a material adverse effect on our business or reputation; (ii) repeated unexplained or unjustified absences from the company; (iii) refusal or willful failure to act in accordance with any specific directions, orders or policies of the company that has a material adverse effect on our business or reputation; (iv) a material and willful violation of any state or federal law that would materially injure the business or reputation of the company as reasonably determined by the Board; (v) participation in a fraud or act of dishonesty against the company which has a material adverse effect on our business or reputation; (vi) conduct by the officer which the Board determines demonstrates gross unfitness to serve; or (vii) intentional, material violation by the officer of any contract between the officer and the company or any statutory duty of the officer to the company that is not corrected within thirty days after written notice to the officer. In addition, in the event of a change of control: 1. Participants in the LTPP would receive at the earlier of the end of the performance period or termination of the program, an LTPP payout equivalent to the greater of the target award or the accrued amount of the payout, and in the case of termination during the first 12 months of the performance cycle, prorated for the amount of time elapsed during the first twelve months of the performance period; and 2. Participants who receive restricted stock unit awards would vest in full immediately prior to the closing of the transaction, unless the awards are assumed, converted or replaced in full by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor. 47 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Termination and Change of Control Table For each of the NEOs, the table below estimates the amount of compensation that would be paid in the event a change of control of the company occurs and executive is terminated without cause or voluntarily terminates at a time when an event constituting good reason has occurred, in both cases either within 24 months following the change of control or within three months prior to such change of control. The amounts shown assume that each of the terminations was effective October 31, 2020.

(4) Mr. Doak retired on May 1, 2020 and as a result, is not included in this table. CEO Pay Ratio The SEC requires companies to disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of their CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of their other employees. Methodology and Pay Ratio We determined the median employee based on the 16,278 employees on our payroll (excluding the CEO) as of October 31, 2020, based on a consistently applied compensation measure defined as the sum of base salary, annual bonus and target LTI value. Once we identified the median employee, the annual total compensation was then calculated according to the SEC’s rules for the Summary Compensation Table. The annual total compensation of our median employee for fiscal year 2020 was $74,440. As disclosed in our Summary Compensation Table on page 39, our CEO’s annual total compensation for fiscal year 2020 was $13,610,481. Based on these compensation amounts, our estimate of the ratio of the annual total compensation of CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee was 183 to 1. As of October 31, 2020, Agilent had employees in 31 countries with 38% in Asia Pacific, 26% in Europe, Middle East and Africa and 36% in the Americas. 48 PROPOSAL 2 - ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL 2 — ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Our stockholders are entitled to cast an advisory vote at the annual meeting to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. The stockholder vote is an advisory vote only and is not binding on the company or its Board of Directors. The company currently intends to submit the compensation of the company’s named executive officers annually, consistent with the advisory vote of the stockholders at the company’s 2011 and 2017 annual meetings. Although the vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors value your opinions and will consider the outcome of the vote in establishing compensation philosophy and making future compensation decisions. As described more fully in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” and “Executive Compensation” sections of the proxy statement, our named executive officers, as identified on page 20 are compensated in a manner consistent with our business strategy, competitive practice, sound compensation governance principles and stockholder interests and concerns. Our compensation policies and decisions are focused on pay-for-performance. We are requesting your non-binding vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as described in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” and “Executive Compensation” sections of the proxy statement. Vote Required The advisory vote regarding approval of the compensation of our named executive officers requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present at the annual meeting or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on this proposal as brokers are not entitled to vote on such proposals in the absence of voting instructions from the beneficial owner. The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers for fiscal 2020. 49 PROPOSAL 3 - RATIFICATION OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM PROPOSAL 3 — RATIFICATION OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Audit and Finance Committee of the Board has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the 2021 fiscal year. During the 2020 fiscal year, PwC served as our independent registered public accounting firm and also provided certain tax and other non-audit services. Although we are not required to seek stockholder approval of this appointment, the Board believes it to be sound corporate governance to do so. If the appointment is not ratified, the Audit and Finance Committee will investigate the reasons for stockholder rejection and will reconsider the appointment. Representatives of PwC are expected to attend the annual meeting where they will be available to respond to questions and, if they desire, to make a statement. Vote Required The appointment of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present at the annual meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. The approval of the appointment of PwC is a routine proposal on which a broker or other nominee is generally empowered to vote in the absence of voting instructions from the beneficial owner, so broker non-votes are unlikely to result from this proposal. The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the Audit and Finance Committee’s appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. 50 AUDIT MATTERS AUDIT MATTERS Fees Paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP The following table sets forth the aggregate fees charged to the company by PwC for audit services rendered in connection with the audited consolidated financial statements and reports for the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years and for other services rendered during the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years to the company and its subsidiaries, as well as all out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with these services: % of % of Fee Category: Fiscal 2020 Total Fiscal 2019 Total Audit Fees $4,826,000 95.7% $4,241,000 91.8% Audit-Related Fees 183,000 3.6% 327,000 7.1% Tax Fees 23,000 0.5% 46,000 1.0% All Other Fees 10,000 0.2% 4,000 0.1% Total Fees $5,042,000 100% $4,618,000 100% Audit Fees: Consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the integrated audit of our consolidated financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting and review of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in quarterly reports. Fiscal 2020 and 2019 audit fees also consist of fees billed for services that are normally provided by PwC in connection with statutory reporting and regulatory filings or engagements and attest services, except those not required by statute or regulation. Audit-Related Fees: Consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements and are not reported under “Audit Fees.” These services include accounting consultations in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, attest services that are not required by statute or regulation, and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. Fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 audit-related fees reflect additional fees of $150,000  and $300,000, respectively, for services performed by PwC. Fiscal 2020 audit-related fees were related to the adoption of new accounting standards, while fiscal 2019 audit-related fees were related to a debt offering comfort letter issuance and the adoption of new accounting standards. Tax Fees: Consist of fees billed for professional services for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. These services include assistance regarding federal, state and international tax compliance, tax audits and appeals, customs and duties, mergers and acquisitions and international tax planning. All Other Fees: Consist of fees for all other services other than those reported above. In making its recommendation to ratify the appointment of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2020, the Audit and Finance Committee has considered whether services other than audit and audit-related services provided by PwC are compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC. Policy on Preapproval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Audit and Finance Committee’s policy is to preapprove all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. Preapproval is generally provided for up to one year and any preapproval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is subject to a specific budget. The Audit and Finance Committee has delegated its preapproval authority up to a specified maximum to the Chairperson of the Audit and Finance Committee, Paul N. Clark, who may preapprove all audit and permissible non-audit services so long as his preapproval decisions are reported to the Audit and Finance Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 51 AUDIT MATTERS AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be “soliciting material,” to be “filed” with the SEC, or to be subject to Regulation 14A or Regulation 14C (other than as provided in Item 407 of Regulation S-K) or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC except to the extent that the company specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) or the Exchange Act. AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT During fiscal year 2020, the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board (the “Audit and Finance Committee”) reviewed the quality and integrity of the company’s consolidated financial statements, the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting, its compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of its independent registered public accounting firm, the performance of its internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm and other significant financial matters. Each of the Audit and Finance Committee members satisfies the definition of independent director and is financially literate as established in the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the Board of Directors has identified Paul N. Clark as the Audit and Finance Committee’s “Financial Expert.” The company operates with a November 1 to October 31 fiscal year. The Audit and Finance Committee met twelve times, including telephone meetings, during the 2020 fiscal year. The Audit and Finance Committee’s work is guided by a written charter that the Board has approved. The Audit and Finance Committee regularly reviews its charter to ensure that it is meeting all relevant audit committee policy requirements of the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the New York Stock Exchange. You can access the latest Audit and Finance Committee charter by clicking on “Committee Charters” in the “Governance” section of the web page at www.investor.agilent.com or by writing to us at Agilent Technologies, Inc., 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd., Santa Clara, California 95051, Attention: Investor Relations. The Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm, the company’s audited consolidated financial statements and its internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit and Finance Committee has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, during the 2020 fiscal year, the matters required to be discussed by AS 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and approved by the SEC. The Audit and Finance Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant’s communications with the Audit and Finance Committee concerning independence and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP its independence from the company. Based on the review and discussions noted above, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to the Board that the company’s audited consolidated financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, and be filed with the SEC.

McMullen reported an aggregate of 4 transactions on 2 late Form 4 filings. Except for the foregoing, we believe that during the 2020 fiscal year, our executive officers and directors complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements. In making these statements, we have relied upon examination of copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5 provided to us and the written representations of our directors and officers. 54 GENERAL INFORMATION Q : Who can participate at the annual meeting? A : Stockholders of record as of January 19, 2021 (the “Record Date”) can participate in and vote at the virtual annual meeting. Q: Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? A : In accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to each stockholder of record, we are furnishing proxy materials, including this proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 (the “Annual Report”), by providing access to such documents on the Internet. Stockholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. Instead, commencing on or about February 4, 2021, a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “Notice”) was sent to most of our stockholders which will instruct you how to access and review the proxy materials on the Internet. The Notice also instructs you to submit your proxy via the Internet. If you would like to receive a paper or email copy of our proxy materials, please follow the instructions for requesting such materials in the Notice. Q : Why am I receiving these materials? A : We are providing these proxy materials to you on the Internet or, upon your request, have delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail, in connection with our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, which will take place on March 17, 2021. Stockholders are invited to participate in the virtual annual meeting and are requested to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement. Q : Who is soliciting my proxy? A : We are soliciting proxies to be used at the annual meeting of stockholders on March 17, 2021, for the purposes set forth in the foregoing Notice. Q : What is included in these materials? A : These materials include: • our proxy statement for our annual meeting; and • our Annual Report, which includes our audited consolidated financial statements. If you requested printed versions of these materials by mail, these materials also include the proxy card for the annual meeting. Q : What information is contained in these materials? A : The information included in this proxy statement relates to the proposals to be voted on at the annual meeting, the voting process, the compensation of directors and our most highly paid officers and certain other required information. Q: Why the change to a virtual meeting? A: We are excited to embrace the latest technology to provide expanded access, improved communication and cost savings for our stockholders and the company. Hosting a virtual meeting will enable increased stockholder attendance and participation since stockholders can participate from any location around the world. Q : What shares owned by me can be voted? A : All unrestricted shares owned by you as of the close of business on January 19, 2021 may be voted. You may cast one vote per share of common stock that you held on the Record Date. These include shares that are: (1) held directly in your name as the stockholder of record, including shares received or purchased through the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 1999 Stock Plan, 2009 Stock Plan and 2018 Stock Plan and the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the “Deferred Compensation Plans”), and (2) held for you as the beneficial owner through a stockbroker, bank or other nominee or held for your account by the Deferred Compensation Plans. You can direct Fidelity, the trustee of the Deferred Compensation Plans, to vote your proportionate interest in the shares of common stock held under the Deferred Compensation Plans by returning a proxy card or voting instruction form or by providing voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone. Fidelity will vote your Deferred Compensation Plan shares as of the record date in the manner directed by you. Because Fidelity is designated to vote on your behalf, you will not be able to vote your shares held in the Deferred Compensation Plans at the meeting. If we do not receive voting instructions from you by 1:00 a.m. Eastern time on March 17, 2021, Fidelity will not vote your Deferred Compensation Plan shares on any of the proposals brought at the annual meeting. On the Record Date, January 19, 2021, we had 305,389,352 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 55 GENERAL INFORMATION Q : What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? A : Most or our stockholders hold their shares through a stockbroker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some differences between shares held of record and those owned beneficially. Stockholder of Record If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent Computershare, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record, and the Notice, or if requested, these proxy materials are being sent directly to you. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the persons named as proxy holders, Michael R. McMullen, Chief Executive Officer and Michael Tang, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, or to vote at the annual meeting. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials, we have enclosed a proxy card for you to use. You may also vote on the Internet or by telephone, as described below under the heading “How can I vote my shares without participating in the virtual annual meeting?” Beneficial Owner If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker or nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you are invited to participate in the annual meeting, but you must registered in advance (see below). You also have the right to direct your broker on how to vote these shares. Your broker or nominee should have enclosed a voting instruction card for you to direct your broker or nominee how to vote your shares. You may also vote by Internet or by telephone, as described below under “How can I vote my shares without participating in the virtual annual meeting?” However, shares held in “street name” may be voted at the virtual annual meeting by you only if you obtain a signed proxy from the record holder (stock brokerage, bank, or other nominee) giving you the right to vote the shares. Q : What is required for admission to the annual meeting? A : Stockholders of Record: In order to be admitted to participate in the virtual annual meeting, you will need the 15-digit control number included on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, your proxy card or on the instructions that accompanied your proxy materials . Beneficial Owners: If you are a beneficial owner, you must register in advance to attend the annual meeting. To register to attend the annual meeting online, you must submit proof of your proxy power (legal proxy) reflecting your holdings in the company along with your name and email address to Computershare. Requests for registration must be labeled as “Legal Proxy” and be received no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on March 10, 2021. You will receive a confirmation of your registration by email after Computershare receives your registration materials. Requests for registration should be directed to Computershare at the following: By email: Forward the email from your broker, or attach an image of your legal proxy, to: legalproxy@computershare.com By postal mail: Computershare, Agilent Technologies, Inc. Legal Proxy, P.O. Box 43001, Providence,  RI 02940-3001. Q: How can I vote my shares at the virtual annual meeting? A : Stockholders of record will need the 15-digit control number included on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, on your proxy card or on the instructions that accompanied your proxy materials.  Beneficial owners who register for the annual meeting in advance, and stockholders of record, will be able to participate in the meeting via live webcast by visiting www.meetingcenter.io/238392758 . The password for the meeting is A2021. You may participate in and vote during the annual meeting by following the instructions available on the meeting website during the meeting. Shares held directly in your name as the stockholder of record may be voted electronically at the annual meeting. Shares for which you are the beneficial owner, but not the stockholder of record also may be voted electronically during the annual meeting but only if you obtain a signed proxy from the record holder (stock brokerage, bank, or other nominee) giving you the right to vote the shares. Even if you plan to participate in the annual meeting online, we recommend that you vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to participate in the annual meeting. Q: How can I vote my shares without participating in the virtual annual meeting? A: Whether you hold your shares directly as the stockholder of record or beneficially in “street name,” you may direct your vote without participating in the virtual annual meeting by proxy. You can vote by proxy over the Internet or by telephone. Please follow the instructions provided in the Notice, or, if you request printed copies of proxy materials, on the proxy card or voting instruction card. 56 GENERAL INFORMATION Q : Can I revoke my proxy or change my vote? A: You may revoke your proxy or change your voting instructions prior to the annual meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may enter a new vote at any time prior to the annual meeting by using the Internet or the telephone or by mailing a new proxy card or new voting instruction card bearing a later date (which will automatically revoke your earlier voting instructions) or by attending and voting at the virtual annual meeting. Your attendance at the annual meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically so request.  If you are the beneficial owner but not the stockholder of record, your broker, bank or other nominee can provide you with instructions on how to change your vote. Q : How are votes counted? A : In the election of directors, your vote may be cast “FOR” or “AGAINST” one or more of the nominees, or you may “ABSTAIN” from voting with respect to one or more of the nominees. Shares voting “ABSTAIN” have no effect on the election of directors. For proposals 2 and 3 your vote may be cast “FOR” or, “AGAINST” or you may “ABSTAIN.”  If you “ABSTAIN,” it has the same effect as a vote “AGAINST.” If you sign your proxy card or broker voting instruction card with no further instructions, your shares will be voted as described below in “Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes.” Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes Any shares represented by proxies that are marked to “ABSTAIN” from voting on a proposal will be counted as present in determining whether we have a quorum. They will also be counted in determining the total number of shares entitled to vote on a proposal. Abstentions and, if applicable, broker non-votes will not be counted as votes “FOR” or “AGAINST” a director nominee. Accordingly, abstentions are not counted for the purpose of determining the number of votes cast in the election of directors. If your shares are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, your broker, in its discretion, may either leave your shares unvoted or vote your shares on routine matters. Only Proposal 3 (ratifying the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm) is considered a routine matter. If your broker returns a proxy card but does not vote your shares, this results in a “broker non-vote.” Broker non-votes will be counted as present for the purpose of determining a quorum. Proposals 1 (election of directors) and 2 (approval of the compensation of our named executive officers) are not considered routine matters, and without your instruction, your broker cannot vote your shares. Because brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on these proposals, broker non-votes will not be counted for the purpose of determining the number of votes cast on these proposals. Q : What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice, proxy or voting instruction card? A : It means your shares are registered differently or are in more than one account. For each Notice you receive, please vote online for each control number you have been assigned. If you receive paper copies of proxy materials, please provide voting instructions for all proxy and voting instruction cards you receive. Q : Where can I find the voting results of the annual meeting? A : We will announce preliminary voting results at the annual meeting and publish preliminary, or final results if available, in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days of the annual meeting. Q : What happens if additional proposals are presented at the annual meeting? A : Other than the three proposals described in this proxy statement, we do not expect any matters to be presented for a vote at the annual meeting. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders, Michael R. McMullen, Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Tang, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the annual meeting. If for any unforeseen reason, any one or more of our nominees is not available as a candidate for director, the persons named as proxy holders will vote your proxy for such other candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board. Q : What is the quorum requirement for the annual meeting? A : The quorum requirement for holding the annual meeting and transacting business is a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to be voted. The shares may be present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting. Both abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Broker non-votes, however, are not counted as shares present and entitled to be voted with respect to the matter on which the broker has expressly not voted. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any of the matters being voted on at the annual meeting. Q : Who will count the vote? A : A representative of Computershare will tabulate the votes and act as the inspector of election. 57 GENERAL INFORMATION Q : Is my vote confidential? A : Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed either within the company or to third parties except (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements, (2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation by the Board. Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy card, which are then forwarded to our management. Q : Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the annual meeting? A : We will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials. We have retained the services of Georgeson LLC (“Georgeson”) to aid in the solicitation of proxies from banks, brokers, nominees and intermediaries. We estimate that we will pay Georgeson a fee of $14,000 for its services. In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made in person, by telephone or by electronic communication by our directors, officers and employees, who will not receive any additional compensation for such solicitation activities. In addition, we may reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to such beneficial owners. Q : May I propose actions for consideration at next year’s annual meeting of stockholders or nominate individuals to serve as directors? A : You may submit proposals for consideration at future annual stockholder meetings, including director nominations. Stockholder Proposals: In order for a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for next year’s annual meeting, the written proposal must be received by us no later than October 9, 2021 and should contain such information as is required under our Bylaws. Such proposals will need to comply with the SEC’s regulations regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in our proxy materials. In order for a stockholder proposal to be raised from the floor during next year’s annual meeting, written notice must be received by us no later than October 9, 2021 and should contain such information as required under our Bylaws. Nomination of Director Candidates: Our Bylaws permit stockholders to nominate directors at a stockholder meeting. In order to make a director nomination at an annual stockholder meeting, it is necessary that you notify us not less than 120 days before the first anniversary of the date that the proxy statement for the preceding year’s annual meeting was first sent to stockholders. Our 2020 proxy statement was first sent to stockholders on February 4, 2021. Thus, in order for any such nomination notice to be timely for next year’s annual meeting, it must be received by us no later than October 9, 2021. In addition, the notice must meet all other requirements contained in our Bylaws and include any other information required pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act. Our Bylaws provide a proxy access right for stockholders, pursuant to which a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least three percent of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years, may nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two individuals or twenty percent of the Board, subject to certain limitations and provided that the stockholders and the nominees satisfy the requirements specified in our Bylaws. Under our Bylaws, to be considered timely, compliant notice of proxy access director nominations for next year’s proxy statement must be received by us no later than October 9, 2021. Copy of Bylaw Provisions: You may contact our Corporate Secretary at our corporate headquarters for a copy of the relevant Bylaw provisions regarding the requirements for making stockholder proposals and nominating director candidates. Additionally, a copy of our Bylaws can be accessed on the Agilent Investor Relations web-site under “Governance.” Q : How do I obtain a separate set of proxy materials if I share an address with other stockholders? A : To reduce expenses, in some cases, we are delivering one set of the proxy materials or, where applicable, one Notice to certain stockholders who share an address, unless otherwise requested by one or more of the stockholders. For stockholders receiving hard copies of the proxy materials, a separate proxy card is included with the proxy materials for each stockholder. For stockholders receiving a Notice, the Notice will instruct you as to how you may access and review all of the proxy materials on the Internet.

The reconciliation of non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 follows: ADJUSTED NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND DILUTED EPS RECONCILIATIONS (In millions, except per share amounts) (Unaudited) Years Ended October 31, 2020 Diluted EPS 2019 Diluted EPS 2018 Diluted EPS GAAP net income $ 719 $ 2.30 $ 1,071 $ 3.37 $ 316 $ 0.97 Non-GAAP adjustments: Asset impairments 99 0.32 — — 21 0.06 Intangible amortization 184 0.59 125 0.39 105 0.32 Transformational initiatives 53 0.17 44 0.14 25 0.08 Acquisition and integration costs 41 0.13 48 0.15 23 0.07 Business exit and divestiture costs 2 0.01 — — 9 0.03 Pension settlement loss 4 0.01 Pension settlement gain — — — — (5 ) (0.02 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt — — 9 0.03 — — Gain on step acquisition of Lasergen — — — — (20 ) (0.06 ) NASD site costs — — 12 0.04 8 0.02 Special compliance costs — — 2 0.01 4 0.01 Acceleration of share-based compensation expense 2 0.01 Other (20 ) (0.06 ) 29 0.09 (10 ) (0.03 ) Adjustment for Tax Reform — — — — 552 1.70 Tax benefit on intra-entity asset transfer transfer — — (299 ) (0.94 ) — — Adjustment for taxes (a) (61 ) (0.20 ) (52 ) (0.17 ) (121 ) (0.36 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 1,023 $ 3.28 $ 989 $ 3.11 $ 907 $ 2.79 Acquisitions — — (10 ) (0.03 ) — — Currency and hedging 1 — (2 ) (0.01 ) 2 0.01 Interest expense associated with acquisitions acquisitions — — 7 0.02 — — Adjusted non-GAAP net income $ 1,024 $ 3.28 $ 984 $ 3.09 $ 909 $ 2.80 (a) The adjustment for taxes excludes tax benefits that management believes are not directly related to on-going operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. For the year ended October 31, 2020, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 15.25%.  For the year ended October 31, 2019, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.75%.  For the year ended October 31, 2018, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 18%. We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to asset impairments, amortization of intangibles, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, business exit and divestiture costs, pension settlement loss, pension settlement gain, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on step acquisition of Lasergen, NASD site costs, special compliance costs, acceleration of share-based compensation expense, adjustment for Tax Reform, and tax benefit on intra-entity asset transfer. A-1 Asset impairments include assets that have been written down to their fair value. Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers including costs to move manufacturing due to new tariffs and tariff remediation actions, site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system and human resources and financial systems. Acquisition and Integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, tax, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. Business exit and divestiture costs include costs associated with business divestitures. Pension settlement loss relates to the relief of the US Retirement Plan pension obligation due to increased lump sum payouts over a specified accounting threshold. Pension settlement gain resulted from transfer of the substitutional portion of our Japanese pension plan to the government. Loss on extinguishment of debt relates to the net loss recorded on full redemption of $500 million of outstanding 5.00% senior notes due July 2020, called on August 16, 2019 and settled on September 17, 2019. Gain on step acquisition of Lasergen resulted from the measurement at fair value of our equity interest held at the date of business combination. NASD site costs include all the costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing of nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients incurred prior to the commencement of commercial manufacturing. Special compliance costs associated with transforming our processes to implement new regulations such as data privacy regulations, revenue recognition, lease accounting and certain tax reporting requirements. Acceleration of share-based compensation expense represents stock-based compensation expense that was accelerated upon employees’ involuntary termination from the company. Other includes certain legal costs and settlements in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments. Adjustment for Tax Reform primarily consists of an estimated provision of $499 million for U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and an estimated provision of $53 million associated with the decrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and its impact on our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. Tax benefit on intra-entity asset transfer relates to our operations in Singapore along with our application of the new accounting rules for income tax consequences of intra-entity transfer of assets as adopted on November 1, 2018. Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance. A-2 Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies . A-3 The reconciliation of adjusted non-GAAP income from operations and operating margins for the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 follows: RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NON-GAAP INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGINS (In millions, except margin data) (Unaudited) Operating Operating FY20 Margin % FY19 Margin % Revenue: $ 5,339 $ 5,163 Subtract: Currency 4 (9 ) Acquisitions — (80 ) Adjusted revenue $ 5,343 $ 5,074 Income from operations: GAAP Income from operations $ 846 15.8% $ 941 18.2% Add: Asset impairments 99 — Intangible amortization 184 125 Business exit and divestiture costs 2 — Transformational initiatives 53 44 Acquisition and integration costs 41 48 NASD site costs — 12 Special compliance costs — 2 Acceleration of share-based compensation expense 2 — Other 29 30 Non-GAAP income from operations $ 1,256 23.5% $ 1,202 23.3% Subtract: Currency and hedging 1 (2 ) Acquisitions — (14 ) Add: Reimbursement from Keysight for services ( * ) 11 12 Adjusted non-GAAP income from operations $ 1,268 23.7% $ 1,198 23.6% (*) Post separation, Agilent is providing Keysight Technologies, Inc. certain site services.  These site services are included in our operating expenses.  The amounts billed to Keysight for these services are recorded in other income.
