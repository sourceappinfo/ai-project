(“Cavco” or the “Company”), it is my privilege to address you with an update on the Company’s financial progress, achievements and outlook. On behalf of the entire Board, Cavco thanks you for your continued support and interest in the Company. Your investment in Cavco has been instrumental in driving the Company’s success. As your Board, we support the management team in achieving sustainable shareholder value by executing against a clear and focused strategy through prudent risk management, sound corporate governance, an executive compensation program aligned with the interests of our shareholders and a focused approach to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) leadership and engagement. The Board would like to highlight a few areas of particular significance for the Company this past fiscal year: • Revenue Growth: The Company experienced robust revenue growth, driven by strong demand for its products, for the thirteenth straight year with net revenue up 32% compared to the last fiscal year. • Profitability: The Company’s focus on operational efficiency and cost optimization has resulted in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increasing to 25.9% compared to the last fiscal year. • Market Expansion: The Company successfully expanded its market presence with an acquisition and two start-ups. These strategic initiatives allowed the Company to capture new opportunities and establish a solid foundation for future growth. • Health and Safety: Cavco has invested in its employees with training and workforce development programs that focus on safety first. As a result, the Company’s OSHA total recordable incident frequency rate for the fiscal year dropped by 10.86% putting the Company better than the industry average. • Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility: Cavco continues to focus on ESG efforts in areas core to its business where a material impact is possible. Management, with oversight by the Board, takes an active role in overseeing the Company’s ESG strategy. Within the past year, the Company published the second edition of its Corporate Responsibility Report and developed an ESG website. Soon, we will be issuing our third report which we anticipate will include sustainability reporting aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. As the Company moves forward, we remain focused on our long-term strategic objectives and our commitment to sustainable growth. We recognize the challenges that lie ahead, including evolving market and financial dynamics. However, the Company is confident in its ability to navigate these obstacles and capitalize on opportunities.

There are presently two Directors in Class II whose terms expire at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Each Director holds office until his or her successor has been elected and qualified or until the Director’s resignation or removal.

In order to be elected as a Director, a nominee must receive an affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast with respect to that Director nominee’s election, which means the number of votes cast “FOR” a Director nominee’s election must exceed the number of votes cast “AGAINST” that Director nominee’s election.

Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 17 Environmental, Social and Governance Commitment to Sustainability Cavco is a leading designer and builder of systems-built structures including manufactured homes, modular homes, commercial buildings, park model RVs and vacation cabins. Founded in 1965, our operations include 29 homebuilding production lines located throughout the United States and two production lines in Mexico, which build some of the most widely recognizable brand names within the factory-built housing industry. The Company is committed to providing quality, energy efficient housing at affordable prices in an environmentally conscious manner, as well as adhering to relevant federal and local regulations regarding employee health and safety. The following are the most critical environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) topics identified by the Board and senior management and how the Company’s leadership prioritizes these areas of focus in our operations: Water and Energy Efficiency Reducing Waste Product Safety and Quality Although minimal water is used in our homebuilding process, we capture, store and reuse rainwater for landscaping needs. Additionally, we seek out and invest in projects that reduce energy use and provide renewable energy for our facilities. Our manufacturing process of building homes in centralized, environmentally protected building centers allows us to minimize adverse impacts on the environment, resulting in reduced levels of waste. Cavco’s homes are built to relevant construction and safety codes and a majority are built in conformance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards requiring substantive testing on the electricity, water and gas pressure and other safety issues. Board and Senior Management Oversight Cavco’s leadership believes a robust approach to ESG will strengthen manufacturing excellence, enhance our employee and customer experience, serve the communities where we do business and increase long-term shareholder value. The Board and its committees support management’s integration of ESG principles into our business strategy in ways that optimize opportunities to make positive impacts while advancing long-term goals. Our Board provides oversight on ESG efforts and Cavco’s executive leadership guides and develops these corporate responsibility programs and provides regular updates to the Board on progress. In 2021, we completed our first assessment of ESG priorities—examining a range of key stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, rating organizations and by studying industry peers. We also drew upon the subject matter expertise of colleagues throughout our organization to collect and organize content. In 2022, we continued to make notable progress on ESG matters, including the following: • Purposefully integrated sustainability initiatives further into our operations. • Created a cross-functional working group of senior executives to design and lead the Company’s ESG initiatives and monitor overall effectiveness. This ESG working group includes members from the manufactured housing and retail business units as well as administrative support groups such as Legal and Risk Management. This ESG group meets on a monthly basis. • Adopted an Environmental Stewardship Policy, a Product Safety and Quality Policy and a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy, outlining the Company’s vision and priorities in ESG. • Identified all sources of carbon emissions at production facilities in order to create a baseline for future measurement and calculation of Cavco’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. • Launched a dedicated “Environmental, Social and Governance” website and a FAQ page to communicate the Company’s vision and priorities to investors, customers and vendors. Against this backdrop, we have engaged with our internal and external stakeholders on our ESG topics to help further inform our future direction. The three areas of focus that we are committed to making a positive impact on our world are: (1) Environmental Responsibility, (2) Social Impact and (3) Culture of Governance. 18 2023 Proxy Statement Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Environmental Responsibility Cavco is committed to being a responsible steward of the environment by considering the environment while conducting business and complying with environmental laws and regulations. Our business is inherently more environmentally responsible than site-built construction, and we intend to keep innovating to increase the energy efficiency of our homes and reduce waste from our manufacturing processes. Cavco is committed to building quality, energy efficient homes for the modern-day home buyer. Cavco invests in a variety of sustainable manufacturing processes to support its green building goals. Oversight on environmental issues is shared by Cavco’s senior management and the Board. Senior management leads the strategic direction of the Company and monitors all progress and performance, including the Company’s environmental initiatives. Our focus on improving the environmental performance of our homes involves both design enhancements and choice of renewable materials. Our homes include environmentally-friendly features such as high indoor air quality, specially designed ventilation systems and energy-efficient envelopes. Additional highlights of our efforts and accomplishments include: • Utilizing high-efficiency electric equipment including LED and motion detector lighting, and high-efficiency HVAC units. • Ongoing elimination of single-use plastics and the implementation of refill stations to eliminate single-use water bottles. • Encouraging environmentally friendly workplace practices by supporting recycling and separation of waste. • Engaging with qualified third-party energy professionals to conduct regular inspections of our production facilities to provide utility and financial savings information. One example of the Company’s commitment to the environmental sustainability of our production processes is the installation of the modern and efficient solar panels on our new Glendale, Arizona factory. This state of-the-art solar energy system will supply approximately 57.9% of the total electrical usage of this facility and reduce its carbon footprint by an estimated 642 metric tons annually. We are currently evaluating other renewable energy opportunities for our other production facilities. We expect vendors and suppliers to engage in practices that reduce waste and require that all materials received from suppliers to comply with HUD code standards. We believe that our focus on environmental responsibility, with the objective of reducing costs and improving sustainability of our operations will provide a strategic benefit to the Company. Furthermore, we recognize that climate change is a growing risk for our planet, and we are committed to doing our part to mitigate this risk by placing increased focus and emphasis on environmental consciousness. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 19 Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Social Impact The Company’s success is built on the belief that it is our team members who make us great. The Company has an ongoing focus to continually improve its culture and talent management practices through the implementation of Human Capital Management (“HCM”) reporting and practices. The Company is committed to pay equity and regularly reviews its compensation model to provide fair and inclusive pay practices throughout the business. A diverse and inclusive workplace begins with our core values. Our goal is to attract, retain and develop a workforce that is diverse in background, knowledge, skill and experience. We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities and training for all qualified applicants and employees without regard to sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status or any other protected class. As of April 2, 2023, the Company employed approximately 7,000 employees. Women represented 23% and self-identified ethnic and racial minorities represented 53% of the Company’s workforce. The Company recently initiated two new leadership training programs, called “Navigate” and “Ignition”, for employees in supervisory roles to enhance communication and other critical management skills to improve the oversight and motivation of the workforce. The “Navigate” program is designed for supervisors and team leads in our manufacturing operations and the Ignition program is geared toward members of the manufacturing and corporate leadership group. To date, 118 employees have completed the “Navigate” program and 131 employees have completed Ignition training. The health and wellness of the Company’s employees is a top priority and in recognition of this the Company aims to provide a robust health and wellness package. The Company regularly updates its benefits plans to remain competitive and meet the needs of our diverse workforce. Components of these benefit programs include medical, dental, and vision plans; tax-advantaged flexible spending, dependent care, and health savings accounts; group life insurance; and a 401(k) program with employer match. Employee safety continues to be a focus and we’ve expanded our approach to improving it. In 2022, our Safety and Risk Management Department engaged a third-party consulting firm to perform Safety Appraisals of our production facilities experiencing Total Recordable Incident Rates (“TRIR”) higher than the national average of our peers. Using this study and other data we began a company-wide safety initiative branded “Safety Now”. This program functions to emphasize safety awareness and provide training and incentives to create a “safety first” culture. As part of our increased safety training plan, we encourage plant Safety Coordinators to complete an OSHA 10-hour training course and in September 2022, we hosted an OSHA 30-hour training program for 13 of our key team members. 20 2023 Proxy Statement Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Our safety efforts are achieving measurable results: • Since Fiscal Year 2021 our TRIR has improved by 23%; • 80% of our production facilities are better than the industry average TRIR; and • We reduced our workers’ compensation experience modifier by   25% over the last four years to a level below the industry average. The Company is also focused on making a positive impact in communities through charity and fundraising, educational sponsorship and local community development. The Company strengthens communities by supporting volunteerism and participation in philanthropic initiatives. Our charitable efforts include: • Homes for Our Own – a program created to provide education and financial assistance to employees who wish to become homeowners; • Donations of building materials and volunteer labor to charitable causes; • Monetary donations to many local charities in the communities we serve; and • Financial support for volunteering activities of our business and operational teams. Culture of Governance Cavco’s Board and senior management team believe that governance is foundational to long-term success. The Company emphasizes a culture of accountability and is committed to conducting business in a manner that is fair, ethical and responsible. The Company also maintains corporate-administered compliance and risk management programs to promote adherence with applicable laws and regulations governing the Company’s business practices. We have greatly enhanced our culture of governance in recent years. We’ve added new directors with new skillsets to our Board, with four of our seven directors having joined since 2019. We have implemented new board practices and procedures to improve communications and controls. We separated the role of CEO and Chairman of the Board in order to enhance the independence of the Board. We have increased the diversity of our Board by adding two women and a person from an underrepresented group. Six of our seven directors are independent. The Board is governed by a formal Code of Conduct, which along with other policies, is reviewed periodically by our Board. The Company is subject to rigorous controls, quarterly financial reviews and annual audits. The Board oversees our audit, compliance and enterprise risk management practices. Our compliance and risk management teams engage with subject-matter experts to identify, monitor and mitigate material risks. The Company maintains an information security program to protect its information assets, as well as customer and consumer data. Lastly, the company monitors and regularly reviews vendor encryption to confirm that proper information security safeguards are maintained. Our IT team works 24/7 and uses a combination of industry-leading tools and in-house innovative technologies to help protect our stakeholders’ data. Our team members are responsible for complying with our data security standards and complete mandatory annual training to understand the behaviors and technical requirements necessary to keep customer information secure. We also offer ongoing education for team members to recognize and report suspicious activity. The primary goal of our data security program is to maintain defenses with industry best practices.

Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 25 Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis Introduction The purpose of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“CD&A”) is to summarize the Company’s philosophy and objectives regarding the compensation of our named executive officers (“NEOs”), including each material element that the Company pays or awards to, or that is earned by, our NEOs. Cavco encourages you to read this CD&A in conjunction with the compensation tables. The following individuals were deemed NEOs for fiscal year 2023. NEOs Position William C. Boor President and CEO Allison K. Aden Executive Vice President, CFO & Treasurer Matthew A. Niño President, Retail Brian R. Cira President, Manufacturing Mickey R. Dragash Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Corporate Secretary & Chief Compliance Officer This CD&A addresses and explains the numerical and related information contained in the Summary Compensation Table and includes actions regarding executive compensation that occurred during fiscal year 2023, including the award of incentive compensation related to fiscal year 2023 performance. Overview of the Company’s Compensation Program The Company’s fiscal year 2023 compensation programs consisted of cash compensation comprised of a base salary and either a cash bonus and/or cash incentive compensation. In addition, the 2023 program included awards of time-based RSUs of the Company’s common stock and performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”), pursuant to the Company’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. Component Description Base Salaries Utilized an independent compensation consultant to benchmark salaries Short-Term Annual Cash Bonus Compensation A target-based short term incentive program (“STIP”) For several positions, a portion of the STIP potential is assigned to individual performance targets Bonus payouts capped at 200% of target Long-Term Equity Compensation Issued time-based RSUs and PRSUs Time vested equity grants defined as a targeted dollar value on date of grant PRSUs to be earned based upon achievement of 3-year targets; settlements are capped at 200% of target award 26 2023 Proxy Statement Executive Compensation Compensation Philosophy We believe that our executive compensation programs should align with the interests of our shareholders and be tied to performance. We view our compensation practices as a means for motivating and rewarding employees in relation to their accomplishments. Our approach is to provide incentive driven market-based compensation programs with the objective of hiring and retaining the talent best suited to deliver sustained high performance to the Company and its shareholders and the customers we serve. Objectives of the Company’s Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation Program The Company’s executive compensation program was structured to achieve the following objectives: • attract, retain and motivate highly qualified and talented executives, enabling the Company to deliver superior results and growth; • create an incentive to increase shareholder returns by establishing a direct and substantial link between individual compensation and certain financial measures of the Company that we believe have a direct effect on shareholder value; and • create substantial and competitive long-term compensation opportunities for individual executive officers based not only on long-term, corporate performance but also on sustained, long-term individual performance. Role of the Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee reviews and approves, or recommends to the Board for approval, all salary and other remuneration for our executive officers as well as oversees matters relating to our employee compensation and benefit programs. The Compensation Committee operates pursuant to a written charter that sets forth its functions and responsibilities. Pursuant to its authority under its written charter, to the extent permitted by Nasdaq Standards and applicable legal requirements, the Compensation Committee may form subcommittees and delegate specified duties and responsibilities to those subcommittees. The Compensation Committee Charter is posted on our website at https://investor.cavco.com/general-documents . Role of Management in Establishing and Awarding Compensation The CEO may assist the Compensation Committee by making recommendations concerning the Company’s performance objectives upon which short-term and long-term incentive compensation is based. Additionally, the CEO annually reviews the performance of the other executive officers and presents his conclusions and recommendations as to salary adjustments and annual equity awards to the Compensation Committee for its consideration. The Compensation Committee does not receive any recommendations from the CEO regarding his own compensation. Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant Pursuant to the authority granted to it in its charter, the Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer Partners, LLC (“Pearl Meyer”) as an independent compensation consultant to provide advice related to the Company’s executive compensation programs. None of the Company’s management participated in the Compensation Committee’s decision to retain Pearl Meyer. Pearl Meyer reported directly to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may replace Pearl Meyer or hire additional consultants at any time. Pearl Meyer attends meetings of the Compensation Committee, as requested, and communicates with the Compensation Committee Chair. However, the Compensation Committee ultimately has sole responsibility to make suggestions and recommendations to the Board related to potential compensation for the Company’s executive officers. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the services provided by its outside consultants and believes that Pearl Meyer is independent in providing executive compensation consulting services. The Compensation Committee conducted a review of its relationship with Pearl Meyer in November 2022 and Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 27 Executive Compensation determined that Pearl Meyer’s work for the Compensation Committee had not raised any conflicts of interest consistent with the guidance provided by the SEC and Nasdaq. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee noted that during fiscal year 2023: • Pearl Meyer did not provide any services to the Company, or its management, other than services to the Compensation Committee. Pearl Meyer’s services were limited to executive and director compensation consulting. Specifically, Pearl Meyer does not provide to the Company, directly or indirectly through affiliates, any non-executive compensation services, including, but not limited to, pension consulting or human resource outsourcing; • Fees paid to Pearl Meyer by the Company were less than 1% of Pearl Meyer’s total revenue; • Pearl Meyer maintains a Conflicts Policy containing specific policies and procedures designed to ensure independence; • None of the Pearl Meyer consultants on the Company’s matters had any business or personal relationship with the members of the Compensation Committee; • None of the Pearl Meyer consultants on the Company matters, or Pearl Meyer, had any business or personal relationship with executive officers of the Company; and • None of the Pearl Meyer consultants on the Company matters own Company stock. The Compensation Committee continues to monitor the independence of its compensation consultant on a periodic basis. Clawback Policy The Board has adopted a policy providing for the recoupment from certain executives of incentive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement or the occurrence of other clawback events described in the policy. The policy is designed to deter and prevent detrimental conduct and to protect our investors from financial misconduct. The Clawback Policy is posted on our website at https://investor.cavco.com/general-documents . Shareholder Approval of our Compensation Decisions At the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company’s shareholders approved the advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation with 94% of the votes entitled to vote and represented by person or by proxy cast in favor of the proposal regarding the Company’s executive compensation program. We believe this vote indicates support by our shareholders of our executive compensation programs and amounts. 28 2023 Proxy Statement Executive Compensation Benchmarking Methodology Market pay levels are one of many elements used by the Company to maintain competitive pay opportunities for our executive officers. For the design of the Company’s fiscal year 2023 executive and non-employee director compensation programs, Pearl Meyer recommended, and the Compensation Committee approved a peer group of 23 national companies in the building products and homebuilding industry. The peer group companies that were used for executive compensation benchmarking and performance benchmarking in fiscal year 2023 are set forth below. We believe that this peer group provides an appropriate benchmark comparison for Cavco. American Woodmark Corporation Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Armstrong World Industries, Inc. Beazer Homes USA, Inc. Century Communities, Inc. Dream Finders Homes, Inc. Ethan Allen Interiors, Inc. Green Brick Partners, Inc. Gibraltar Industries, Inc. Hooker Furnishings Corporation Installed Building Products, Inc. Landsea Homes Corporation La-Z-Boy Incorporated Lifetime Brands, Inc. LGI Homes, Inc. PGT Innovations, Inc. Quanex Building Products Corp. Simpson Manufacturing Co. Inc. Skyline Champion Corp. TopBuild Corp. Trex Company, Inc. TRI Pointe Group Inc. WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp. This peer group data provided by Main Data Group (“MDG”), an affiliate of Pearl Meyer, and proprietary survey data provided by Pearl Meyer were used to identify compensation design changes to the Company’s fiscal year 2023 program. The data MDG provided included compensation benchmarking and corporate governance analytics. All data and analytics were regularly updated and information was gathered using the peer group’s public SEC filings. Analysis was conducted by employment position title. MDG’s incentive statistics project a “target” payout. From this statistical data, a ratio is calculated which compares the compensation of Cavco’s executives to the compensation companies in the peer group pay their executives. The ratio reflects the comparison of Cavco’s executive compensation versus the median executive compensation for the peer group. The ratio comparison includes base compensation, STIP, long-term incentives and total direct compensation. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 29 Components of Executive Compensation Base Salary The purpose of the base salary is to provide a fixed amount of cash compensation that is not variable and is generally competitive with market practices. Consistent with our pay-for-performance objective, the base salary for each of our NEOs is designed to account for only a portion of their overall total target compensation. We believe the NEO base salaries are appropriate based on the officers’ roles, responsibilities, experience and contributions to the Company, as well as compared to market data. For fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the annual base salaries for each of our NEOs were as follows: Name 2022 Annual Base Salary 2023 Annual Base Salary Percentage Increase William C. Boor $850,000 $950,000 12% Allison K. Aden $450,000 $450,000 0% Brian R. Cira $200,000 $250,000 25% Matthew A. Niño $200,000 $200,000 0% Mickey R. Dragash $325,000 $325,000 0% At the Board’s discretion, Mr. Boor’s base salary increase was attributable to his strategic leadership in multiple acquisitions and increasing total shareholder return. Mr. Cira’s base salary increase was due to the increased scope of his responsibilities overseeing the Manufactured Housing business. Annual Short-Term Incentive Cash Compensation In fiscal 2023, Mr. Boor, Ms. Aden and Messrs. Cira, Niño and Dragash, each participated in a corporate STIP which consists of an annual cash incentive bonus based upon Company and individual objective-based performance. 1. Company Performance : Mr. Boor, Ms. Aden and Messrs. Cira, Niño and Dragash were each granted an opportunity to earn a company performance-based cash bonus under the Company’s STIP program. For fiscal year 2023, the target corporate performance STIP payouts expressed as a percentage of base salary and the threshold and maximum payouts for each individual were as follows: Name Threshold (x of Target) Target Maximum (x of Target) William C. Boor 0.5x 120% 2x Allison K. Aden 0.5x 80% 1.5x Brian R. Cira (1) 0.5x 20% 1.5x Matthew A. Niño (2) 0.5x 25% 1.5x Mickey R. Dragash 0.6x 70% 1.2x (1) In addition to the corporate performance-based STIP program described above, Mr. Cira’s was also eligible to receive 0.45% of pre-tax income for the manufacturing operations he oversees. (2) In addition to the corporate performance-based STIP program described above, Mr. Niño was also eligible to receive 5% of pre-tax income for the retail operations he oversees. 30 2023 Proxy Statement Components of Executive Compensation For fiscal year 202 3 , the corporate STIP program performance criteria was based on the financial forecast approved by the Committee, as follows: (1) 90% based on fiscal year 202 3 adjusted factory-built housing segment pre-tax profit; and (2) 10% based on fiscal year 202 3 adjusted financial services segment pre-tax profit. Factory-built housing segment target pre-tax profit was based on the forecasted pre-tax profit, with threshold attainment being at 7 0% of that figure and stretch attainment be ing 13 0% of that figure. In the financial services segment, target pre-tax profit was based on the forecasted pre-tax profit, with threshold attainment being at 70% of that figure and stretch attain ment being 130% of that figure. A graphical depiction of the fiscal year 2023 corporate STIP program and actual results is set forth below: 90% of factory-built housing – Earnings driven corporate STIP 10% of financial services – Earnings driven corporate STIP For fiscal year 2023, Mr. Boor, Ms. Aden and Messrs. Cira, Niño and Dragash received corporate performance STIP payouts of $2,157,238, $519,233, $72,116, $72,116 and $267,051, respectively. As noted above, in addition to the corporate performance-based STIP program described above, Mr. Cira received $1,360,365 for the manufacturing operations he oversees and Mr. Niño also received $1,112,644 related to the retail operations he oversees. See further information below. These payments are reflected in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table. 2. Individual Objective Based Performance : For Ms. Aden, an award of 20% of her base salary is based upon individual performance objectives as mutually agreed upon between her and the President and CEO. For Mr. Dragash, an award of 30% of his salary is based upon individual performance objectives as mutually agreed upon between him and the President and CEO. For Messrs. Cira and Niño, an award of 20% and 25% of their base salary, respectively, is based upon individual performance objectives as mutually agreed upon between them and the President and CEO, and CFO. Ms. Aden and Messrs. Cira, Niño and Dragash’s STIP payouts were $90,000, $50,000, $50,000 and $50,000, respectively, for the achievement of individual performance objectives, which represented full attainment in all cases. The elements that comprise each individual’s performance objectives vary by position, but primarily consist of measurable goals that have a meaningful impact upon the Company’s overall financial performance as well as the leader’s professional development. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 31 Components of Executive Compensation Long-Term Equit y Compensation The third component of executive officer compensation is long-term equity compensation. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 long-term equity incentive program consisted of (1) time-based RSUs; and (2) PRSUs. On May 25, 2022, Mr. Boor, Ms. Aden and Messrs. Niño, Cira and Dragash were granted the equity awards set forth in the following table under the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. The awards made to Messrs. Boor and Dragash were pursuant to their employment agreements. RSUs are subject to a time-based vesting schedule such that 33% of the shares vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, 33% on the second anniversary of the grant date, and 34% on the third anniversary of the grant date. Name RSUs (#) PRSUs (#) at Target William C. Boor 5,480 5,480 Allison K. Aden 1,910 1,910 Brian R. Cira 840 840 Matthew A. Niño 600 600 Mickey R. Dragash 840 840 The performance element of the PRSU focuses on value creation, growth, and operational improvement, with each measure receiving an equal allocation and measured individually on threshold, target and maximum levels. Value creation is measured by total shareholder return relative to industry comparables. Growth is defined as the market share improvement when compared to the manufactured housing industry. Operational improvement is based upon improvement in the number of units produced per employee equivalent. Shares under the PRSU awards will be measured and issued at the end of a three year period. Earnout of Fiscal Year 2021-2023 PRSU Awards PRSUs previously granted in fiscal year 2021 vested at the end of this fiscal year 2023. The design of the fiscal year 2021 PRSUs, goals and number of PRSUs earned by each NEO are summarized in the following tables. ` Measure Weight Threshold 50% Target 100% Stretch 200% Results to Date Market share 33% 0% 5% 10% 20.5% Floors per employee 33% 2% 5% 8% 3.1% Relative total shareholder return 34% 20% 50% 80% 43.6% Market Share:  Market share shall be determined by reference to the percentage difference between: (i) the total number of Company units shipped during the fiscal year ending immediately prior to the Performance Period divided by the number of Housing and Urban Development Code Home shipments during the same period and (ii) the total number of Company units shipped during the last fiscal year of the Performance Period divided by the number of Housing and Urban Development Code Home shipments during the same period.

OPTION AWARDS Name Number of Shares Acquired on Exercise (#) Value Realized on Exercise ($) (1) William C. Boor 4,000 549,520 (1) The value realized for the option awards is the difference between the market price of the underlying security at exercise and the exercise or base price of the option. Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control The following table describes and quantifies the potential payments that we would provide to our NEOs in connection with termination of employment, including for good reason, cause or change in control. The amounts that would actually be paid to an NEO upon a termination of employment would depend on the circumstances and timing of termination or change in control. The terms “Good Reason”, “Cause” and “Change in Control” are defined in the executives’ various employment agreements. All severance payments under the employment agreements are conditioned upon the delivery and non-revocation of a customary release by the executive in favor of the Company. Each of the employment agreements include customary provisions concerning the timing, limitation and alteration of payments to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). Consistent with the SEC’s rules and regulations concerning executive compensation disclosure, the potential value of benefits payable assumes that the termination occurred on April 1, 2023, and with a closing stock price of $317.74 per share on the last business day of fiscal year 2023. The value of the acceleration of stock vestings was computed based on the closing price of our stock on the last day of fiscal year 2023 for each equity award affected. Total termination benefits represent payments for severance, non-compete and non-disclosure covenants.

Dragash — 1,832,374 1,832,374 — 682,903 2,965,830 CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure In accordance with Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee. In determining the median compensated employee, SEC rules allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, apply certain exclusions, and make reasonable estimates and assumptions reflecting their unique employee populations. Therefore, our reported pay ratio may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in industry, business models and scale, as well as the different estimates, assumptions, and methodologies applied by other companies in calculating their respective pay ratios. Excluding our CEO and, pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the Company’s recently acquired Solitaire Homes consisting of 950 employees, we identified our median employee by preparing a list of all 5,639 individuals employed by the Company as of April 1, 2023, and examined the total compensation paid to each such individual as reflected in the Company’s payroll records. We included all employees (other than our CEO and Solitaire Homes employees), whether employed on a full-time, part-time, seasonal or Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 39 Option Exercises and Stock Vested temporary basis. We annualized the compensation for any permanent employees who were not employed by us for all of fiscal year 202 3 . From that listing, we identified a small sample of 15 employees, consisting of the median employee and 14 other employees whose gross pay was very close to the median employee’s gross pay (“Median Group”). We then calculated annual total compensation for such employees using the same methodology we use to calculate NEO compensation for the summary compensation table and selected the median employee from the Median Group. The fiscal year 2023 annual total compensation of our CEO was $5,410,215, the fiscal year 2023 annual total compensation of our median employee was $51,160, and the ratio of these amounts is 106:1. 40 2023 Proxy Statement Pay versus Performance As required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and certain measures of financial performance of the Company.

Company Performance Measures Listed below are the financial and non-financial performance measures which in the Company’s assessment represent the most important performance measures used to link compensation actually paid to our NEOs, for 2023, to the Company’s performance: • Adjusted Pre-tax Income • Individual Objective Based Performance • Market Share • Floors per employee • Relative TSR Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 43 PROPOSAL 2: Advisory Vote on the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and Section 14A of the Exchange Act enables the Company’s shareholders to vote on an advisory (non-binding) basis regarding the compensation of the Company’s NEOs (commonly referred to as “Say on Pay”). Consistent with the mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are seeking shareholder approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed pursuant to the SEC’s compensation disclosure rules (which disclosure includes the CD&A and the related compensation tables in this Proxy Statement). We currently present the Say on Pay advisory vote to our shareholders annually at each annual meeting of the shareholders. The next Say on Pay advisory vote is expected to occur at the 2024 annual meeting of shareholders, unless the Board modifies its policy on the frequency of holding such advisory vote based on the outcome of Proposal 3 of this Proxy Statement to be voted on by the shareholders. For a comprehensive description of our executive compensation program and philosophy, please refer to the narrative disclosures in the CD&A section of this Proxy Statement. Although the advisory vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board will review the results of the vote and consider the outcome when making future decisions concerning Cavco’s executive compensation program. In deciding how to vote on this proposal the Board points out the following factors, many of which are more fully discussed in the CD&A: • Our executive compensation programs are designed to depend significantly on the achievement of performance goals that the Compensation Committee believes drive long-term shareholder value; • Our pay practices are designed not to encourage management to take unacceptable risks; • Our Compensation Committee reviews peer group compensation to confirm that our programs are not outside the norm among peer group companies (see the CD&A subsection “Benchmarking Methodology”); and • We believe the Company’s executive compensation programs are well suited to promote the Company’s objectives in both the short and long-term. Recommendation of the Board The Board recommends a vote “ FOR ” the following advisory resolution: RESOLVED, that the shareholders of the Company approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company’s NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K , including the CD&A, Summary Compensation Table, related compensation tables, notes and narrative discussion in this Proxy Statement. 44 2023 Proxy Statement PROPOSAL 3: Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Future Advisory Votes on Compensation of Named Executive Officers Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Board is asking the Company’s shareholders to vote on whether future advisory votes on the compensation of the NEOs in the nature of a proposal similar to that reflected in Proposal 2 above, should occur every year, every two years or every three years. Accordingly, the following resolution will be submitted for a stockholder vote at the Annual Meeting: RESOLVED, that the stockholders shall be given the opportunity to vote on an advisory resolution regarding the compensation of the Company’s NEOs (vote for one alternative only): • every year; • every two (2) years; or • every three (3) years. As discussed above, the Company has designed its executive compensation programs to attract, retain and motivate key executives; to create an incentive to increase stockholder returns by establishing a direct and substantial link between individual compensation and certain financial measures that have a direct effect on shareholder values; and to create substantial long-term compensation opportunities for individual executive officers based not only on long-term corporate performance but also on sustained long-term individual performance. The Board has determined that a one- year Say-on-Pay vote frequency is the best approach for the Company based upon, among other things, the following: • at the 2017 Annual Meeting, the shareholders voted to hold a non-binding stockholder vote to approve executive compensation every year; • annual votes are consistent with market preferences; • our compensation decisions are made annually; • annual votes allow our shareholders to provide their feedback on our executive compensation program more frequently; and • annual votes give us the opportunity to address any shareholder concerns regarding our executive compensation program in a more timely manner. Although the advisory vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors will review the results of the vote and consider the outcome when making future decisions concerning the frequency of Say on Pay voting. Recommendation of the Board The Board recommends a vote “ FOR ” holding future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers every year Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 45 PROPOSAL 4: Approval of the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan Proposal Summary On May 16, 2023, the Board approved, subject to the approval of our shareholders, the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “2023 Omnibus Plan”). The 2023 Omnibus Plan is intended to replace the Company’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2005 Plan”). The 2005 Plan will be automatically replaced and superseded by the 2023 Omnibus Plan on the date on which the 2023 Omnibus Plan is approved by our shareholders, provided that any outstanding awards granted under the 2005 Plan will remain in effect pursuant to their terms. If shareholder approval is not received, the 2005 Plan will remain in place, pursuant to its terms, until it expires. If the 2023 Omnibus Plan is approved, as of its effective date, a total of 550,000 shares will be available for future awards under the 2023 Omnibus Plan. No awards will be granted under the 2005 Plan or any other prior plan on or after the effective date of the 2023 Omnibus Plan and after the 2023 Omnibus Plan becomes effective any unused shares left in the 2005 Plan will be retired. We anticipate that the 550,000 shares will allow the 2023 Omnibus Plan to operate for several years, although this could change based on other factors, including but not limited to merger and acquisition activity. We believe that equity-based awards are an important part of our overall compensation program and want to ensure that we have a modern equity program and a sufficient number of shares available to adequately incentivize our officers, employees, directors and consultants. As of April 1, 2023, we had 143,576 stock options (with weighted-average exercise price of $160.40 and weighted-average remaining contractual life of 2.9 years) outstanding under the 2005 Plan, and 54,319 full value restricted stock units and performance units outstanding under the 2005 Plan. We did not have any other equity awards outstanding under the 2005 Plan or any other equity plan as of that date. The Board believes the potential dilution from equity issuances to be made under the 2023 Omnibus Plan is reasonable and that approval of the 2023 Omnibus Plan is important in that it allows us to continue awarding equity incentives, which are an important component of our overall equity compensation program. In addition, the 2023 Omnibus Plan contains shareholder friendly governance provisions including: • It does not contain an evergreen provision; • It includes a “double trigger” provision such that awards will not fully vest following a change in control unless there is also an involuntary termination of employment; • It prohibits liberal share recycling; • It requires a minimum vesting period of 12 months for at least 95% of the share pool; and • It prohibits the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested awards. Our burn rate for the last three years (the “Burn Rate”), which we define as the total number of shares subject to awards granted in a calendar year (which includes the total number of options granted, as applicable) expressed as a percentage of our basic weighted average shares outstanding, was 0.4% for fiscal 2023, 0.3% for fiscal 2022, and 0.6% for fiscal 2021, and the average Burn Rate over the last three fiscal years was 0.4%. The closing price of our common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq on June 2, 2023 was $270.95 per share. If the 2023 Omnibus Plan is approved by our shareholders, we anticipate filing a Form S-8 registration statement with the SEC shortly after the Annual Meeting to register the shares authorized for issuance under the 2023 Omnibus Plan. 46 2023 Proxy Statement PROPOSAL 4: Approval of the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan Plan Summary Purpose. The purpose of the 2023 Omnibus Plan is to promote the success and enhance the value of the Company by linking the personal interest of the participants to those of the Company’s shareholders by providing the participants with an incentive for outstanding performance. Eligible Participants . Any non-employee director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates will be eligible to participate in the 2023 Omnibus Plan. As of June 2, 2023 we had 6 non-employee directors, 9 officers, approximately 7,000 employees and no consultants, although we expect that, based on our current usage, awards will be generally limited to approximately 6 non-employee directors, 9 officers, and 75 employees. Effective Date. If approved by the shareholders, the 2023 Omnibus Plan will become effective on the date it is approved by the shareholders and will remain in effect until it expires ten years thereafter or, if sooner, is terminated by the Board. Types of Awards. The 2023 Omnibus Plan provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of our common stock (“Shares”), including stock options intended to qualify as incentive stock options (“ISOs”) under Section 422 of the Code and nonqualified stock options that are not intended to so qualify (“NQSOs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards, and other equity-based or equity-related awards including restricted stock units and performance units (each, an “Award”). Administration. The 2023 Omnibus Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board or, with respect to non-employee directors, the Board. The Compensation Committee shall consist of 2 or more individuals, each of whom qualifies as: (a) a “non-employee director” as defined in Rule 16b‑3(b)(3) of the General Rules and Regulations of the Exchange Act; and (b) “independent” for purposes of the Nasdaq Listing Rules (or rules of any other exchange upon which the Stock is then traded), in each case, as each such rule or regulation is in effect from time to time. All references in the 2023 Omnibus Plan to the “Compensation Committee” shall be, as applicable, to the Board or the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has board power and authority to administer the 2023 Omnibus Plan including, without limitation, to interpret the terms of, and determine any matter arising pursuant to, the 2023 Omnibus Plan or any award agreement, to correct any defects and reconcile any inconsistencies in the 2023 Omnibus Plan or any award agreement, and to make all other decisions or determinations that may be required pursuant to the 2023 Omnibus Plan or an award agreement. Share Reserve. Subject to adjustment as provided below, the maximum aggregate number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to Awards granted under the 2023 Omnibus Plan will be 550,000 Shares (the “Share Pool”). No awards will be granted under the 2005 Plan or any other prior plan on or after the effective date of the 2023 Omnibus Plan. Shares granted under the 2023 Omnibus Plan will consist, in whole or in part, of (i) authorized and unissued Shares, (ii) treasury Shares or (iii) Shares purchased on the open market. Solely for purposes of counting the number of Shares available for grant under the 2023 Omnibus Plan, the following share counting rules shall apply: • Each Share that is subject to an award granted under 2023 Omnibus Plan shall reduce the Share Pool by one (1) Share. • If, after the effective date, any Award granted under the 2023 Omnibus Plan is forfeited or otherwise expires, terminates or is canceled or forfeited without the delivery of all Shares subject thereto, or is settled other than wholly by delivery of Shares (including cash settlement), then, the number of Shares subject to such Award shall be added to the Share Pool as one (1) Share. • The following Shares shall not be added to the Share Pool upon the occurrence of any of the following: (a) Shares tendered or withheld by the Company in payment of the exercise price of an option Award under the 2023 Omnibus Plan; (b) Shares tendered or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to an Award under the 2023 Omnibus Plan; (c) Shares subject to a SAR under the 2023 Omnibus Plan that are not issued in connection with its stock settlement on exercise thereof; and (d) Shares reacquired by the Company on the open market or otherwise using cash proceeds from the exercise of options under the 2023 Omnibus Plan. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 47 PROPOSAL 4: Approval of the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan Other Plan Limits. The maximum aggregate number of Shares in the Share Pool that may be issued pursuant to ISOs is 550,000 (the “ISO limit”). Limit for Non-Employee Directors . The aggregate grant date fair value of Awards (including Share-based and cash-based Awards) that may be granted under the 2023 Omnibus Plan to a non-employee director, plus the aggregate amount of all cash payments made to such non-employee director, for service as director during any fiscal year may not exceed $750,000. Adjustments . In the event of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, rights offering, spin-off,  other distribution with respect to the shares of Stock, any “equity restructuring” (as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 718), or any similar corporate transaction the Compensation Committee shall, to the extent it deems equitable and appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights, make a proportionate adjustment in: (a) the number and class of shares of Stock made available for grant; (b) the number of shares of Stock set forth in Section 7.2(h) of the 2023 Omnibus Plan and any other similar numeric limit expressed in the 2023 Omnibus Plan; (c) the number and class of and/or price of Shares, units, or other rights subject to the then-outstanding Awards; (d) the performance targets or goals appropriate to any outstanding Awards; or (e) any other terms of an Award that are affected by the event. Description of Awards Stock Options . A stock option is a right to purchase Shares in the future at an exercise price determined by the Compensation Committee at the date of grant. Generally, the per-Share exercise price for stock options will not be less than the fair market value on the date of grant (and not less than 110% of such fair market value for ISO grants made to holders of more than 10% of the Company’s voting power). The terms and conditions of stock options (including exercise price and vesting) will be determined by the Compensation Committee subject to limits set forth in the 2023 Omnibus Plan and as set forth in the applicable award agreement. All stock options granted under the 2023 Omnibus Plan will be NQSOs unless the applicable award agreement expressly states that the stock option is intended to be an ISO. All terms and conditions of all grants of ISOs will be subject to Section 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The maximum term for an option is 10 years. The exercise price of a stock option will be permitted to be paid with cash or its equivalent (e.g., check) or, in the sole and plenary discretion of the Compensation Committee, in Shares (whether or not previously owned by the holder) having a fair market value equal to the aggregate option price for the Shares being purchased and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Compensation Committee; partly in cash and, to the extent permitted by the Compensation Committee, partly in such Shares or, subject to such requirements as may be imposed by the Compensation Committee, through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares obtained upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the Company an amount out of the proceeds of such sale equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased. SARs . A SAR is an unfunded and unsecured promise to deliver Shares or cash equal to the appreciation of the Fair Market Value of a Share over an exercise price. The per-Share exercise price of a SAR will not be less than the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. Each SAR will be vested and exercisable at such time, in such manner and subject to such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, specify in the applicable award agreement or thereafter. Upon exercise of a SAR, the holder will receive the value of the appreciation in the Share subject to the SAR over the exercise price. SARs will be permitted to be settled in cash or Shares or a combination, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The maximum term for a SAR is 10 years. Restricted Stock . A share of restricted stock will be an actual Share granted under the 2023 Omnibus Plan that will be subject to certain transfer restrictions, forfeiture provisions and/or other terms and conditions specified in the 2023 Omnibus Plan and in the applicable award agreement. The terms and conditions of restricted shares will be determined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in the applicable award agreement, including the vesting schedule, vesting criteria (including any performance goals), term and methods and form of settlement. Restricted shares will be evidenced in such manner as the Compensation Committee may determine. Any restricted stock granted under the 2023 Omnibus Plan shall be evidenced in such manner as the Compensation Committee may deem appropriate, including book-entry registration 48 2023 Proxy Statement PROPOSAL 4: Approval of the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates (in which case, the certificate(s) representing such Shares shall be legended as to sale, transfer, assignment, pledge or other encumbrances during the restriction period and deposited by the holder, together with a stock power endorsed in blank, with the Company, to be held in escrow during the restriction period). Other Stock-Based Awards (Including RSUs and Stock Grants and Stock Units) . Another stock-based award is an equity-based or equity-related compensation Award not previously described above. Outright grants of fully vested Shares (whether payable in cash, equity or otherwise), performance units, restricted stock units, and dividend equivalents. The Compensation Committee will determine the amounts and terms and conditions of any such Awards, provided that they comply with applicable laws. Dividends or dividend equivalents, payable in cash, Shares, or a combination thereof, on a deferred basis, on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dividends (including payable in connection with restricted stock) or dividend equivalents (payable in connection with awards other than options or SARs or cash-settled phantom awards) shall in all events be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the underlying award and shall not be paid unless and until the underlying award is vested or earned. Description of Other Plan Terms Change of Control. Except as otherwise provided in an award agreement or employment agreement, if a participant’s employment (or service) is terminated without cause during the 6 month period preceding, or the 12 month period following a change of control, then: (a) all Awards that are subject to restrictions based solely on the passage of time shall become fully vested, exercisable and all restrictions on such Awards shall lapse; and (b) any Awards that are subject to restrictions based on the attainment of performance goals shall immediately vest in full at the target level of performance. Any action taken pursuant to this Section shall be effectuated in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Amendment and Termination . With the approval of the Board, at any time and from time to time, the Compensation Committee may terminate, amend or modify the Plan; provided, however, that any such action of the Compensation Committee shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, or rule of the stock exchange on which the shares of Stock are listed, quoted or traded.  Except as provided in Section 4.4 of the 2023 Omnibus Plan, neither the Board nor the Compensation Committee may, without the approval of shareholders: (a) increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2023 Omnibus Plan; (b) permit the Compensation Committee to grant Options or SARs with an exercise price or base value that is below Fair Market Value on the Date of Grant; (c) permit the Compensation Committee to extend the exercise period for an Option or SAR beyond 10 years from the Date of Grant; (d) amend Section 7.1(e) of the 2023 Omnibus Plan to permit the Compensation Committee to reprice previously granted Options; (e) amend Section 8.1(e) of the 2023 Omnibus Plan to permit the Compensation Committee to reprice previously granted SARs; (f) extend the duration of the 2023 Omnibus Plan; or (g) expand the type of awards available for grant under the 2023 Omnibus Plan or expand the class of participants eligible to participate in the 2023 Omnibus Plan. Assignability . No right or interest of a participant in any Award may be pledged, encumbered, or hypothecated to, or in favor of, any party other than the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate, or shall be subject to any lien, obligation, or liability of such participant to any other party other than the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate and except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, no Award shall be assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of by a participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, if applicable, until the expiration of any period during which any restrictions are applicable or any performance period as determined by the Compensation Committee. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Compensation Committee shall have the authority to adopt a policy that is applicable to existing Awards, new Awards, or both, which permits a participant to transfer Awards during his or her lifetime to any family member. Withholding . The Company or any subsidiary shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold automatically from any amount deliverable under the award or otherwise, or require a holder to remit to the Company, up to the maximum statutory amount necessary (or such lower amount that will not cause an adverse accounting consequence or cost to the Company, in the applicable jurisdiction, to satisfy any Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 49 PROPOSAL 4: Approval of the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of the 2023 Omnibus Plan.  With respect to required withholding, holders may elect (subject to the Company’s automatic withholding right set out above), subject to the express approval of the Compensation Committee, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold Shares having a fair market value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any  federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign taxes that could be imposed on the transaction. Minimum Vesting . Notwithstanding any provision of the 2023 Omnibus Plan to the contrary, no portion of any equity-based Award shall vest prior to the 12 month anniversary of the Award’s vesting commencement date; provided that: (a) the Compensation Committee may grant equity-based Awards that do not comply with the 12 month minimum vesting requirement as long as the number of shares of Stock subject to such equity-based Awards does not exceed 5% of the applicable numeric limit set forth in Section 4.1 of the 2023 Omnibus Plan; and (b) the 12 month minimum vesting requirement shall not apply to equity-based Awards granted to non-employee directors that vest on the earlier of the 12 month anniversary of the vesting commencement date or the next annual meeting of shareholders as long as such vesting period for such non-employee director Award is not less than 50 weeks from the Date of Grant. Clawback . Notwithstanding any provision of the 2023 Omnibus Plan to the contrary, in an Award Agreement, the Compensation Committee shall include provisions calling for the recapture or clawback of all or any portion of an Award to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law, including, but not limited to, the final rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Listing Rules (or any other exchange upon which the Stock is then listed) pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. New Plan Benefits The Company has not approved any awards that are conditioned upon shareholder approval of the 2023 Omnibus Plan.  Awards under the 2023 Omnibus Plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion.  The issuance of any awards under the Plan will be at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Therefore, except as set forth in footnote (1) below, it is not possible to determine the number of shares that will be granted to any individual in the future under the 2023 Omnibus Plan. As discussed elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, currently, William C. Boor and Mickey R. Dragash are compensated pursuant to the terms of an employment agreement. Each employment agreement contemplates the annual award of time-based and performance-based restricted stock unit awards.  The ultimate number of shares to be awarded to Messrs. Boor and Dragash pursuant to the each executive officer’s employment agreements will be determined based on the value of the award as determined by the Compensation Committee and the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, and with respect to the performance shares awards, the Company’s achievement levels of the applicable performance targets, which achievement may vary from 0% to 200%. Also as discussed elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, the Chairman of the Board of Directors currently receives an annual equity award of $140,000 in value of restricted stock units and all other non-employee directors receive an annual equity award of $110,000 in value of restricted stock units.  Accordingly, we anticipate that in future periods our non-employee directors will be granted restricted stock units under the 2023 Omnibus Plan determined on the date of grant based on the market value of our common stock on such grant date.  If the 2023 Omnibus Plan had been in effect in fiscal year 2023, we expect that our award grants for fiscal year 2023 would not have been different from those actually made in that year under the 2005 Plan. For information regarding grants made under the 2005 Plan during 2023, see the table entitled “Grants of Plan-Based Awards . 50 2023 Proxy Statement PROPOSAL 4: Approval of the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan The table below sets forth the equity awards that were granted under the 2005 Plan during fiscal year 2023 to our NEOs and other persons.

Equity Compensation Plan Information The following table sets forth information as of April 1, 2023 with respect to the Company's compensation plans and individual compensation arrangements under which the Company's equity securities were authorized for issuance to directors, officers, employees, consultants and certain other persons and entities in exchange for the provision of goods or services. The following table does not reflect grants made during fiscal year 2024.

The summary is based on the law as in effect on December 31, 2022. The summary does not discuss state or local tax consequences or non-U.S. tax consequences. As a general rule, with the exception of a fully vested stock grant or stock unit award, a participant will not recognize taxable income with respect to any award at the time of grant. A participant will recognize income on a fully vested stock grant award or fully vested stock unit award at the time of grant and, subject to any deduction limitations set forth in the Code, the Company will be entitled to a concurrent income tax deduction equal to the ordinary income recognize by the participant. Incentive Stock Options . An ISO results in no taxable income to the optionee or a deduction to the Company at the time it is granted or exercised for regular federal income tax purposes. However, upon exercise, the excess of the fair market value of the Shares acquired over the option exercise price is an item of adjustment in computing the alternative minimum taxable income of the optionee, if applicable. If the optionee holds the Shares received as a result of an exercise of an ISO for the later of two years from the date of the grant or one year from the date of exercise, then the gain realized on disposition of the Shares is treated as a long-term capital gain. If the Shares are disposed of during this period, however (i.e., a “disqualifying disposition”), then the optionee will include in income, as compensation for the year of the disposition, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Shares, upon exercise of the option over the option exercise price (or, if less, the excess of the amount realized upon disposition of the Shares over the option exercise price). Any additional gain or loss recognized upon the disposition will be recognized as a capital gain or loss by the optionee. In the event of a disqualifying disposition, subject to any deduction limitations set forth in the Code, the Company will be entitled to a deduction, in the year of such a disposition, in an amount equal to the amount includible in the optionee’s income as compensation. The optionee’s tax basis in the Shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO is equal to the option price paid, plus any amount includible in his or her income as a result of a disqualifying disposition. Any further gain realized by the optionee will be taxed as short-term or long-term capital gain and will not result in any deduction by the Company. A disqualifying disposition occurring in the same calendar year as the year of exercise would eliminate the alternative minimum tax effect of the ISO exercise. The foregoing summary of tax consequences associated with the exercise of an ISO and the disposition of Shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO assumes that the ISO is exercised during employment or within three months following termination of employment. The exercise of an ISO more than three months following termination of employment will result in the tax consequences described below for NQSOs, except that special rules apply in the case of disability or death. An individual’s stock options otherwise qualifying as ISOs will be treated for tax purposes as NQSOs (and not as ISOs) to the extent that, in the aggregate, they first become exercisable in any calendar year for stock having a fair market value (determined as of the date of grant) in excess of $100,000. NQSOs. An NQSO results in no taxable income to the optionee or deduction to the Company at the time it is granted. An optionee exercising an NQSO will, at that time, realize taxable compensation in the amount equal to the excess of the then fair market value of the Shares over the option exercise price. Subject to any deduction limitations set forth in the Code, the Company will be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes in the year of exercise in an amount equal to the taxable compensation realized by the optionee. The optionee’s tax basis in Shares received upon exercise is equal to the sum of the option exercise price plus the amount includible in his or her income as compensation upon exercise. Any gain (or loss) upon subsequent disposition of the Shares will be a long or short-term capital gain to the optionee (or loss), depending upon the holding period of the Shares. The foregoing summary assumes that the Shares acquired upon exercise of an NQSO option are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Stock Appreciation Rights . The grant of a SAR results in no taxable income to the holder or a deduction to the Company at the time of grant. A holder of a SAR will, at the time of exercise, realize taxable compensation in the amount equal to the excess of the then fair market value of the Shares over the option exercise price. Subject to any deduction limitations set forth in the Code, the Company will be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes in the year of exercise in an amount equal to the taxable 52 2023 Proxy Statement PROPOSAL 4: Approval of the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan compensation realized by the holder of the SAR. To the extent the SAR is settled in Shares, any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the Shares will be capital gain or loss. Restricted Stock Awards . A holder acquiring restricted stock generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the Shares on the date the Shares are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (and are freely transferable) unless the holder has elected to make a timely election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code, in which case, the holder will recognize ordinary income on the date the Shares were acquired. Upon the sale of Shares acquired pursuant to a restricted stock award, any gain or loss, based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value upon which the holder recognized ordinary income, will be taxed as a capital gain or loss. Subject to any deduction limitations set forth in the Code, the Company generally should be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the holder on the determination date. Other Stock-Based Awards . The grant of restricted stock units, performance units, or other stock-based awards will result in no taxable income to the holder or deduction to the Company. A holder awarded one of these awards will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the cash or Shares delivered to the holder on the settlement date. Where an award is settled in the Shares, any additional gain or loss recognized upon the disposition of such shares or property will be capital gain or loss. Subject to any deduction limitations set forth in the Code, the Company generally should be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the holder on the determination date. Section 409A . Section 409A of the Code imposes restrictions on nonqualified deferred compensation. Failure to satisfy these rules will result in accelerated taxation, an additional tax to the holder of the amount equal to 20% of the deferred amount and a possible interest charge. Stock options granted with an exercise price that is not less than the fair market value of the underlying Shares on the date of grant will not give rise to “deferred compensation” for this purpose unless they involve additional deferral features. Stock options that will be awarded under the 2023 Omnibus Plan are intended to be eligible for this exception. In addition, it is intended that the provisions of the 2023 Omnibus Plan comply with Section 409A of the Code, and all provisions of the 2023 Omnibus Plan will be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under these rules. THE FULL TEXT OF THE 2023 Omnibus Plan IS ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT AS APPENDIX A AND THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO SUCH TEXT. The Board recommends a vote “ FOR ” the approval of the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 53 Audit Fees The following table represents the aggregate fees billed to Cavco for professional services provided by RSM US LLP (“RSM”) in the last two fiscal years. 2023 2022 Audit Fees $ 1,503,220 $ 1,461,390 Audit-Related Fees - - Tax Fees 523,100 394,151 All Other Fees - - Total $ 2,026,320 $ 1,855,541 The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures pre-approving all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by RSM . These policies and procedures require that the Company may not engage RSM to render audit or non-audit services unless the Audit Committee specifically approves the service in advance or the engagement is entered into pursuant to a pre-approval authorization. In determining whether or not to pre-approve services, the Audit Committee determines whether the service is a permissible service under the SEC’s rules and, if permissible, the potential effect of such services on the independence of RSM . The Audit Committee may also authorize any Committee member to approve any audit or non-audit related services that RSM may provide. Any approval of services by an Audit Committee member pursuant to this delegated authority is to be reported at the next meeting of the Audit Committee. All of the audit fees, tax fees and all other fees resulting from services provided by RSM as set forth in the table above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the foregoing procedures. As used in the above table: • “Audit Fees” are the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Form 10-K, internal controls and review of Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Form 10-Q quarterly reports or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. • “Tax Fees” are the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. • “All Other Fees” are for all other services not captured in the audit or tax categories. All work performed during the fiscal year 2023 and 2022 audits was completed by full-time employees of RSM. 54 2023 Proxy Statement Audit Fees Report of the Audit Committee In accordance with its written charter, the primary function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of: (i) the quality and integrity of Cavco’s accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices and processes; (ii) the financial information to be provided to the shareholders of Cavco; (iii) the systems of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting established by management; (iv) compliance with the Company’s Code of Conduct; (v) the independent auditors’ qualifications and independence; (vi) the performance of the Company’s independent auditors; and (vii) the internal audit process. Management is responsible for the Company’s financial reporting process including the system of internal controls along with the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

We have been advised that a representative of RSM will attend the Annual Meeting. Such representative will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. Recommendation of the Board The Board recommends a vote “ FOR ” the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2024. 56 2023 Proxy Statement About the Annual Meeting: Frequently Asked Questions Q. Why Did I Receive These Proxy Materials? A. You received these proxy materials because you were a shareholder of Cavco stock as of June 2, 2023, the record date fixed by the Board. Therefore, you are entitled to receive notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote on matters presented at the Annual Meeting that will be held on August 1, 2023. Q. Why Did I Receive a Notice Instead of a Full Set of Proxy Materials? A. The SEC allows Cavco to make these proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement and the Company’s Annual Report to Shareholders, which includes the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 1, 2023, available electronically via the internet at www.proxyvote.com . On or about June 15, 2023, Cavco mailed you a Notice containing instructions for accessing this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report for voting over the internet. If you received the Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail unless you request them. If you would like a printed copy of Cavco’s proxy materials, please follow the instructions for requesting printed materials in the Notice. Q. Who Can Vote? A. Record shareholders of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Cavco at the close of business on June 2, 2023. On that date, the outstanding capital stock of Cavco entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting consisted of 8,675,203 shares of common stock. Each shareholder will be entitled to one vote per share on the election of Directors and each other matter that is described above or that may be properly brought before the meeting. Shares that may be voted include shares that are held: (1) directly by the shareholder of record; or (2) beneficially through a broker, bank or other nominee. Q. What is the Difference between Holding Shares as a “Registered Owner” and a “Beneficial Owner”? A. Most of Cavco’s shareholders hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between registered shares and those owned beneficially: Registered Owners — If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the Company or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Beneficial Owners — If your shares are held in a brokerage account, bank or by another nominee, you are with respect to those shares the “beneficial owner” of shares held in street name. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote those shares at the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not a shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your broker, bank or other nominee (who is the shareholder of record) giving you the right to vote the shares. Q. What is a “Broker Non-Vote”? A. Generally, a broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank or other nominee that holds shares in street name for a customer is precluded from exercising voting discretion on a particular proposal because the: (i) beneficial owner has not provided instructions on how to vote; and (ii) such broker, bank or other nominee lacks discretionary voting power to vote on such issues. Accordingly, a broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to the approval of “non-routine” matters absent specific voting instructions from the beneficial owners of such shares. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 57 About the Meeting: Frequently Asked Questions Q. What Constitutes a Quoru m for the Annual Meeting ? A. The holders of a majority of shares entitled to vote on June 2, 2023, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Cavco will count abstentions and broker non-votes as present for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. In the event the requisite votes for approval of the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting are not received prior to the Annual Meeting date, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Annual Meeting in order to solicit additional votes. The form of proxy being solicited by this Proxy Statement provides the authority for the proxy holders, in their discretion, to vote the shareholders’ shares with respect to a postponement or adjournment of the Annual Meeting. At any postponed or adjourned meeting, proxies received pursuant to this Proxy Statement will be voted in the same manner described in this Proxy Statement with respect to the original meeting. Q. What Items will be Voted on at the Annual Meeting and What is the Required Vote to Approve Each Item? A. Proposal No. 1 ( Election of Directors ): In order to be elected as a Director, a nominee must receive an affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast with respect to that Director nominee’s election, which means the number of votes cast “FOR” a Director nominee’s election must exceed the number of votes cast “AGAINST” that Director nominee’s election. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not treated as votes cast and will have no effect on Proposal No. 1. Proposal No. 2 ( Advisory Vote on the Compensation of the NEOs ) : The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and represented by person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting is required for approval. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against Proposal No. 2. Broker non-votes will not be treated as entitled to vote on the proposal and will have no effect on Proposal No. 2. Proposal No. 3 ( Advisory Vote on the frequency of the vote on the Compensation of the NEOs ) : The option of one year, two years or three years that receives the highest number of votes will be considered to be the preferred frequency selected by our shareholders for future Say on Pay votes. Proposal No. 4 ( Approval of the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan ): The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and represented by person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting is required for approval. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against Proposal No. 4. Broker non-votes will not be treated as entitled to vote on the proposal and will have no effect on Proposal No. 4. Proposal No. 5 ( Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ): The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and represented by person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting is required for approval. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against Proposal No. 5. Because brokers, banks, or other nominees that hold shares in street name may exercise discretionary voting authority for this proposal, we do not expect there will be any broker non-votes. Q. Will there be other items to be voted on at the Annual Meeting? A. Cavco is not aware of any other matters that may come before the Board at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, your proxy authorizes the individuals named as proxies to vote, or otherwise act, in accordance with their discretion. Q. How will Proxies be voted at the Annual Meeting? A. If you are a registered owner, your shares represented by valid proxies received by telephone, via the Internet or by mail will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the directions given. If no specific choice is indicated, the shares represented by all valid proxies received will be voted: (i) FOR the election of the two (2) nominees for director named in the proxy; (ii) FOR approval of the advisory vote to approve the compensation of our n amed executive officers; (iii) FOR holding future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers every year; (iv) FOR approval of the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan; and (v) FOR the ratification of the appointment of RSM as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2024. 58 2023 Proxy Statement About the Meeting: Frequently Asked Questions If you hold your shares in “street name”, the record holder does not have discretionary voting power with respect to non-routine matters absent specific voting instructions from you. Other than the proposal to ratify the appointment of RSM, all of the proposals at this year’s Annual Meeting are considered non-routine matters. Therefore, your shares will not be voted without your specific instructions on those non-routine matters, resulting in a broker non-vote. If you provide voting instructions to the record holder of your shares, the record holder will vote in accordance with the instructions given. The record holder of your shares will, however, continue to have the ability to vote your shares in its discretion on th e ratification of Proposal No. 5 ( Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ) if you do not otherwise provide voting instructions. Q. How do I Cast a Vote? A. Shareholders can vote their shares of common stock at the Annual Meeting by: (1) telephone; (2) via the Internet; (3) completing, signing, dating and returning the proxy or voting instruction card in the enclosed envelope; or (4) in person at the Annual Meeting. Q. Can I Change my Mind after I vote? A. You have the unconditional right to revoke your proxy at any time prior to tabulation. To revoke your proxy, you must: • Submit written notice of revocation to Cavco’s Corporate Secretary : Mickey R. Dragash , Cavco Industries, Inc., 3636 North Central Avenue, Suite 1200, Phoenix, Arizona 85012; • Mail a new proxy card dated after the date of the proxy you wish to revoke to Cavco’s Corporate Secretary at the address listed above; • Submit a later-dated proxy over the Internet or by telephone in accordance with the instructions provided for therein; or • If you are a shareholder of record or you obtain a legal proxy from your broker, trustee or nominee, as applicable, you may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in-person.
