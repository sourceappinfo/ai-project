held on Tuesday, April 30, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. This year’s
Annual Meeting will be held in a virtual format through a live webcast
to facilitate stockholder attendance regardless of location and reduce
the carbon footprint of Citi’s activities. Details relating to the Annual
Meeting logistics are provided in this 2024 Proxy Statement and at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CITI2024. At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will vote on a number of important
matters. Please take the time to carefully read each of the proposals
described in the Proxy Statement. Thank you for your support of Citi. Sincerely, John C. Dugan Chair of the
Board Table of Contents 4 2024 Board Letter to Stockholders 2023 marked the second
full year of Citi’s execution of the multi-year strategic and Transformation goals set forth at our last Investor Day, in early
2022. Once again, despite some serious and unforeseen challenges, the Company made significant progress in achieving these goals. Perhaps the most significant
challenge arose from the cluster of bank failures and resolutions that occurred in March 2023, with attendant concerns about the potential
for contagion and systemic risk. Here, Citi demonstrated the strength of its diversified business model and prudent risk management.
The Company had deliberately managed its interest rate risk to have far lower unrealized losses from the sharp rise in interest rates
than those experienced by the banks that failed. It was therefore able to play a central role, along with other large banks, in providing
support for the government’s effort to achieve an orderly resolution of the problems, which in turn helped restore depositor confidence
across the system. Nevertheless, the bank failures that did occur caused substantial deposit insurance losses, which large banks were
required to cover through sharp increases in their deposit insurance premiums, including a $1.5 billion expense for Citi in the fourth
quarter of 2023. In terms of its strategic
goals, the Company continued its successful divestitures of the 14 non-U.S. consumer businesses identified at Investor Day. As of the
date of this letter, nine of the businesses have been sold; three have been substantially wound down (Korea, Russia, and China); the
Mexico consumer business is on track for an initial public offering beginning in 2025; and the Polish consumer business—despite
the war in Ukraine—is once again being offered for sale. Taken together, these transactions continue to simplify Citi and significantly
reduce headcount and expense. In the wake of this progress
on divestitures, the Company embraced its most significant structural changes since it announced its strategy on Investor Day: it reorganized
the firm to focus much more transparently on the five core businesses of Services, Markets, Banking, Wealth, and U.S. Personal Banking,
the heads of which now report directly to the CEO. The reorganization also eliminated previous regional structures and unnecessary layers
of management, while establishing a centralized Client organization led by a new Chief Client Officer to enhance the focus of all Citi
businesses on client service. The new organization is plainly simpler, and its transparency will increase accountability to you, our
stockholders, for improved business performance. As important as these changes
are to Citi’s future, their success depends fundamentally on the multi-year Transformation of the Company’s risk and control
environment and data architecture—the number one priority of the firm. With most of the planning and foundational work completed
in 2021 and 2022, Citi’s focus shifted to execution and improved outcomes in 2023. The Company made substantial progress over the
course of the year, as evidenced by the retirement of roughly 390 legacy applications in 2023, thereby simplifying its technology infrastructure
and enabling greater focus on more strategic platforms. The Company also launched a SMaRT platform for booking controls in Markets to
reduce manual trade entry errors by 85 percent across more than 50 trade order/entry systems. Notwithstanding this progress,
enhanced performance will be necessary to achieve expected improvements in data quality and regulatory reporting, which are key priorities
for 2024. The Board is keenly focused on the Transformation receiving the resources necessary for its successful completion. Turning to business performance,
2023 was mixed. The Services business had a record year; Markets’ performance was solid; and revenues rebounded in U.S. Personal
Banking based on significantly increased borrowing in Cards. At the same time, revenues declined for both Wealth and Banking, but for
both businesses Citi was able to attract strong new leaders to help improve results going forward. Overall, the key metric of
Total Stockholder Return showed marked improvement year-over-year; the firm met its full year expense guidance; and revenues increased
to $78.5 billion. That said, Citi incurred a number of idiosyncratic expenses in the fourth quarter, and the Return on Tangible Common
Equity (RoTCE) declined to a disappointing 4.9 percent for the year. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents 5 Looking forward, and taking
into account the strategic divestitures, reorganization, and progress on the Transformation, management remains confident that Citi is
on track to meet the medium-term financial targets set forth at Investor Day, including achieving an 11-12 percent RoTCE. The Board continues
to believe that significantly improving RoTCE in the medium- and longer-term is critical to improving Citi’s Total Stockholder
Return—and our oversight of financial performance will continue to be focused on achieving that result. Thank you for your ongoing
support of Citi. Dialogue with stockholders is a fundamental feature of a well-governed organization, and we will continue to make it
a priority. Please write with any concerns or suggestions to: Citigroup Inc. Board of Directors, c/o Brent J. McIntosh, Chief Legal Officer

    AND SOCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Key
ESG Initiatives $1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Goal We set a goal of $1 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030. We finance and facilitate sustainable solutions related to climate such as
renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation and circular economy and social finance activity including affordable
housing, economic inclusion, food security and healthcare. On an annual basis, Citi reports financial progress toward this goal as well
as the associated environmental and social impacts within our global ESG reporting. Climate Change Citi’s net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions commitment includes our financed emissions target by 2050 and our operational footprint
emissions target by 2030. We publish updates on our progress in our climate reporting, including baseline emissions and 2030 targets for
priority sectoral loan portfolios. Over 2023, our climate change progress included the following areas of activity: ● Implemented
    the Climate Risk Assessment and Scorecard (CRAS) - an assessment designed to identify our clients’ significant climate-related
    risks and their plans to adapt to and/or mitigate those risks–using both quantitative and qualitative inputs–into client-level
    credit review processes for a number of sectors. ● Further
    developed and refined the Net Zero Review Template (NZRT), which helps internal teams better understand the alignment of clients’
    transition strategies applicable to their respective sectors. In 2022–2023, the initial NZRT assessment process was completed
    for our Energy and Power clients, and in 2023, we began the assessment process for Auto Manufacturing and Steel clients. The assessment
    process focuses on clients with significant emissions relative to each sector’s baseline emission profiles. ● Continued
    climate training for first line banking teams, Risk and Global Functions personnel, and established the Sustainability Learning Center
    open to all employees (see highlight on the following page). ● Participated
    in the development of the Sustainable Aluminum Finance Framework (see highlight on the following page). Sustainable Operations In addition to our 2030 net zero GHG commitment for our operations, Citi continues to reduce the environmental impact of its facilities.
We have set 2025 Operational Footprint goals, which include reductions in emissions, energy, water consumption and waste generation as
well as the pursuit of sustainable building certifications for our facilities. Our efforts to further integrate sustainable practices
across our geographic footprint also include renewable electricity sourcing, employee engagement and seeking opportunities for efficiency
in business travel. Progress toward these operational footprint goals is provided in our annual ESG reporting. Citi
also purchases voluntary third-party verified carbon credits consisting of a portfolio of nature-based, energy efficiency and methane
destruction credits in an amount equivalent to our Scope 1 direct GHG emissions. Workforce
    Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Our
    approach to workforce diversity, equity and inclusion includes providing equal employment opportunities and creating a more
    inclusive environment. We set aspirational representation goals to increase women leadership globally and Black leadership in the
    United States at the firm by the end of 2021. In 2022, Citi announced new aspirational representation goals, which are more global
    and inclusive of a number of dimensions of diversity. In 2023, we promoted a diverse Managing Director (MD) class, with women making
    up nearly 30% of the cohort. We continue to leverage diverse slates in our recruiting efforts for all U.S.-based roles and at least two qualified women interviewed for global roles at
    the AVP to MD levels. To retain and develop our talent, we support internal mobility by investing in career development programs,
    mentorship, networking, rotational programs and initiatives with our global employee resource groups. For additional details on our

                                            continues to work to support financial inclusion and economic opportunity in underserved
                                            communities. In the U.S., Citi and the Citi Foundation have continued to advance the work
                                            begun through the Action

                                            to help close the racial wealth gap. This includes expanding support for Community Development
                                            Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) as well as integrating
                                            the objectives underlying ARE into Citi’s core business, including through the
                                            work of dedicated business teams focused on supporting the needs of diverse financial institutions
                                            and financial inclusion. Through its Impact Fund, Citi makes direct equity investments in startup companies in the U.S. that are applying innovative solutions
to critical issues for underserved communities. Such investments are intended to help startups serve beneficiaries in the areas of Financial
Resilience, Future of Work, Climate Resilience and Social Infrastructure solutions that deliver more equitable access to healthcare, mobility
and housing. Citi
                                            also advances financial inclusion by providing specialized technical and capacity building
                                            support to nonprofits and municipalities addressing financial inclusion solutions. In 2023,
                                            the Citi Start Saving ® platform
                                            enabled qualified public sector and nonprofit entities to efficiently manage matched savings

Compensation and Human Capital Resources and Management Highlights Summary of 2023 Executive Compensation Decisions This Proxy
Statement provides detailed information concerning our executive compensation program, and the alignment between our performance and
the compensation we paid to our executive officers named in this Proxy Statement (named executive officers (NEOs)), beginning on
page 72. The following supplements that discussion by summarizing the principal executive compensation decisions we made for
2023. CEO Compensation The Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee (Compensation Committee) set Ms. Fraser’s total compensation for
2023, her second full year as our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), at $26 million, consisting of a base salary of $1.5 million and an incentive
award of $24.5 million. In setting the amount of Ms. Fraser’s incentive award, the Compensation Committee took into account the
2023 results of Citi’s strategic and operational efforts, Ms. Fraser’s exemplary leadership, absolute and relative total stockholder
returns for 2023, including the various elements of Citi’s executive compensation program that tie compensation to total stockholder
return, and an analysis of competitive market levels of pay for CEOs of peer companies. As Citi’s CEO, Ms. Fraser has created
a firm foundation for great progress and transformative evolution, setting the conditions for a period of substantial upside potential.
While that potential is present, it has not yet been fully realized and reflected in our financial performance, but the Compensation Committee
believes that real progress has been made. 2023 financial results are discussed on pages 78 and 79 below. The Compensation Committee has seen positive change in the organization because of Ms. Fraser’s leadership efforts. To start with,
the Compensation Committee notes Ms. Fraser’s leadership in shaping certain changes in operational matters. Those efforts are complemented
by Ms. Fraser’s ability to enunciate an overall vision for the organization and to convey that vision to multiple stakeholders. Regarding strategy, in 2022, Ms. Fraser established a clear set of priorities for Citi to increase stockholder value over time: Citi’s
Transformation, Strategic Refresh, Improved Culture and Talent and most recently Citi’s Organizational Simplification. Notwithstanding
a challenging macroeconomic environment for the banking industry, including persistent inflation uncertainty, regional bank turmoil, the
U.S. debt ceiling crisis and geopolitical conflict and tension around the globe, under Ms. Fraser’s leadership in 2023 Citi continued
to deliver against its guidance and make solid progress on each of our strategic priorities. As in 2022, Ms. Fraser’s incentive
compensation for 2023 was delivered in three parts. First, 35% was delivered in the form of deferred
Citi common stock awards. Second, 15% was paid in cash at the beginning of 2024. Third, the
remainder of Ms. Fraser’s incentive compensation was delivered in the form of Performance Share Units (PSUs). Overall, 85% of Ms. Fraser’s incentive compensation was equity-based, and 59% of the equity-based compensation was delivered in the form
of PSUs. Other Executive Compensation Citi has since 2013 delivered a portion
of incentive compensation for our EMT in the form of PSUs. For 2023, we expanded the use of PSUs in our
compensation program by extending the use of PSUs to EMT members resident in the UK. In addition, our EMT was enlarged from 16 to 19
executives. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation and Human Capital Resources and Management Highlights 17 As
described more fully on page 93 below, the Compensation Committee determined that 100% of the target number of shares subject to
PSUs granted as part of our 2020 incentive compensation awards were earned for the three-year performance period from 2021 through
2023. This determination reflected the capping of above-target financial metric performance because of negative total stockholder
return during such period. The resulting payout value was equal to 93% of initial value, reflecting the impact of both financial
performance and total stockholder return, as compared to a zero payout for the prior period. To
incentivize effective execution in connection with the Consent Order programs and to drive change in Citi’s risk and control
environment and culture, in August 2021 the Compensation Committee approved a long-term performance-based bonus program (the
Transformation Bonus Program). Following the completion of the first performance measurement period under the Transformation Bonus
Program, the Compensation Committee determined that the Performance Achievement Percentage for the period ending on December 31,
2022 would be 94%. Following the completion of the second performance measurement period under the Program, the Compensation
Committee determined that the Performance Achievement Percentage for the period ending on December 31, 2023 would be 80%. In each
case, the determination reflected the Compensation Committee’s assessment of performance relative to preset
targets. While Ms. Fraser is not eligible to participate in the Transformation Bonus Program, all other members of our EMT at
the time the Program was adopted, as well as approximately 250 other employees who were deemed to be critical to
execution in connection with the Consent Order programs, are eligible to participate. The metrics established for the
second performance period included execution, quality of execution and culture change. Citi provides the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board on an ongoing basis information regarding its
plans and progress and continues to work constructively with these regulators to reflect their feedback on
remediation efforts. Human
Capital Resources and Management Citi strives to deliver to its full potential by focusing on its strategic priority of attracting and retaining highly
qualified and motivated colleagues. Citi seeks to enhance the competitive strength of its workforce through the
following efforts: ● Continuously innovating its efforts to recruit, train, develop, compensate, promote and engage colleagues ● Actively
seeking and listening to diverse perspectives at all levels of the organization ● Optimizing transparency concerning workforce goals to promote accountability, credibility and effectiveness in achieving those goals ● Providing compensation programs that are competitive in the market and aligned to strategic objectives In
2023, Citi undertook significant changes to simplify the Company and accelerate the progress it is making in executing its strategy.
As previously disclosed, Citi aligned its organizational structure to its business strategy–making the Company more client centric
and agile, speeding up decision-making, improving productivity to deliver efficiency and driving increased accountability across the
organization. Citi is aligned around five businesses–Services, Markets, Banking, U.S. Personal Banking and Wealth–focusing
on a streamlined client organization to strengthen how Citi delivers for clients across the Company and around the globe. Workforce
Size and Distribution As of December 31, 2023, Citi employed approximately 239,000 colleagues in over 90 countries. The Company’s
workforce is constantly evolving and developing, benefiting from a strong mix of internal and external hiring into
new and existing positions. In 2023, Citi welcomed over 38,000 new colleagues in addition to filling 44,600 roles by
colleagues through internal mobility and promotions. Citi also sustains connections with former colleagues through
our Alumni Network, and in 2023 hired more than 3,000 “returnees” back to Citi. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 18 Executive Compensation and Human Capital Resources and Management Highlights The following table presents the geographic distribution of Citi’s colleagues by segment or component and gender: Segment

Information regarding gender is self-identified by colleagues. Driving a Culture of Excellence and Accountability Citi continues to embark on a talent and culture transformation to drive a culture of excellence and accountability that is supported
by strong risk and controls management. Citi’s Leadership Principles of “taking ownership, delivering with pride and succeeding together” have been reinforced
through a behavioral science-led campaign, referred to as Citi’s New Way, that reinforces the key working habits that support Citi’s
leadership culture. Citi’s performance management approach also emphasizes the Leadership Principles through a four-pillar system, evaluating colleagues
against financial performance, risk and controls, and client and franchise goals as well as how colleagues deliver from a leadership perspective.
The performance management and incentive compensation processes and associated policies and frameworks have enhanced accountability through
increased rigor and consistency, in particular for risk and controls. The
culture shift is supported by changes in the way Citi identifies, assesses, develops and promotes talent, particularly at senior
levels of the Company. Citi promotes a new class of managing directors each year. This is a testament to these individuals’
performance and commitment to living our Leadership Principles and instilling them throughout their teams and the entire Company.
Further, all potential successors to EMT roles are evaluated by the Board and are now subject to a risk
and controls assessment. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Citigroup’s Board is committed to ensuring that the Board and Citi’s EMT are composed of individuals whose backgrounds reflect
the diversity of Citi’s employees, customers and other stakeholders. In addition, Citi has continued its efforts to support its
globally diverse workforce, including, among other things, taking actions with respect to pay equity, setting aspirational representation
goals and using diverse slates and hiring panels in recruiting. Citi’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion continues to reflect a workforce that represents the clients it serves globally
from all walks of life, backgrounds and origins. Understanding that diversity fuels our culture and business success, Citi’s 2025
aspirational representation goals are embedded in its business strategy. Having aspirational goals across all levels–from early
career through senior leadership roles–will help ensure Citi not only has diverse talent in leadership roles but will also help
build a diverse talent pipeline for the future. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Executive Compensation and Human Capital Resources and Management Highlights 19 The
Company constantly strives to ensure Citi remains a great place to work, where people can thrive professionally and personally. In
2023, Citi increased its unique Inclusion Network membership by 23.8% and added 15 new global Inclusion Network chapters. The
Company launched the Allyship 365 initiative, focused on cultivating allyship year round and educating colleagues on its diversity,
equity and inclusion efforts. Citi values pay transparency and has taken significant action to provide both managers and colleagues with greater clarity around Citi’s
compensation philosophy. Citi has introduced market-based salary structures and bonus opportunity guidelines in various countries worldwide,
and posts salary ranges on all external U.S. job postings, which aligns with strategic objectives of pay equity and transparency. Citi
also raised its U.S. minimum wage in 2022, the second broad-based increase in less than two years. In addition, Citi has focused on measuring and addressing pay equity within the organization: ● In
                                            2018, Citi was the first major U.S. financial institution to publicly release the results
                                            of a pay equity review comparing its compensation of women to that of men, as well as U.S. minorities to U.S. non-minorities. Since 2018, Citi has continued to be transparent
                                            about pay equity, including disclosing its unadjusted or “raw” pay gap for both
                                            women and U.S. minorities. The raw gap measures the difference in median compensation. The
                                            existence of Citi’s raw pay gap reflects a need to increase representation of women
                                            and U.S. minorities in senior and higher-paying roles. ● In
2023, due to its organizational and management simplification initiatives, Citi paused its annual pay equity analysis, as the Company
continues the process of aligning roles to its new organizational structure. Citi looks forward to resuming routine pay equity reviews
once that work is complete. ● For
historical context, Citi’s 2022 pay equity review determined that on an adjusted basis, women globally are paid on average more
than 99% of what men are paid at Citi, and that there was not a statistically significant difference in adjusted compensation for U.S.
minorities and non-minorities. ● Citi’s
2022 raw pay gap analysis showed that the median pay for women globally was 78% of the median for men, up from 74% in 2021 and 2020.
The median pay for U.S. minorities was more than 97% of the median for non-minorities, which was up from just above 96% in 2021 and 94% in 2020. Workforce Development Citi’s numerous programmatic offerings aim to reinforce its culture and values, foster understanding of compliance requirements
and develop competencies required to deliver excellence to its clients. Citi encourages career growth and development by offering broad
and diverse opportunities to colleagues, including the following: ● Citi provides a range of internal development and rotational programs to colleagues at all levels, including an extensive leadership curriculum,
allowing the opportunity to build the skills needed to transition to supervisory and managerial roles. Citi’s tuition assistance
program further enables colleagues in North America to pursue their educational goals. ● Citi continues to focus on internal talent development and aims to provide colleagues with career growth opportunities. Of the 44,600
mobility opportunities filled in 2023, 14% were open roles applied for and filled by internal candidates, and 38% were filled by colleagues
who applied for, and were promoted into, new opportunities. These opportunities are particularly important as Citi focuses on providing
career paths for its internal talent base as part of its efforts to increase organic growth within the organization. ● Citi enabled Development Plans for colleagues of all levels. Last year, more than 100,000 employees completed a plan, setting a roadmap
for how they can achieve their career aspirations. Well-being and Benefits Citi is proud to provide a wide range of benefits that support its colleagues’ mental, emotional, physical and financial well-being
through various life stages and events. Citi is focused on providing equitable benefits that are designed to attract, engage and retain
colleagues. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 20 Executive Compensation and Human Capital Resources and Management Highlights Citi has significantly enhanced mental well-being programs by offering free, accessible counseling sessions for colleagues and their family
members, as well as offering an online tool so that all colleagues around the globe can easily find their local Employee Assistance Programs
and resources. Citi offers instructor-led mental health training for people managers to equip them in supporting their team members. Citi also continues to value the importance of physical wellbeing–providing employees in several office locations and countries
access to onsite medical care clinics, fitness centers, subsidized gym memberships and virtual fitness programs. Citi continues to make
modern telemedicine programs increasingly available to colleagues and their family members through programs like digital physical therapy, which rolled out in the U.S. in 2022. In 2023, one year after we became the first major U.S. bank to publicly embrace a flexible, hybrid work model, Citi fully implemented
it across the organization. Most of Citi’s colleagues now work in hybrid roles, working remotely up to two days a week. How We Work
provides the majority of Citi’s colleagues with the ability to balance the demands of their home lives with the work commitments that are
necessary for success. The program includes three role designations for colleagues globally: Resident, Hybrid or Remote. The implementation
and continuation of this program differentiates Citi from other financial organizations with respect to flexible working arrangements.
By embracing a flexible model of work, Citi has focused on keeping its approach consistent and aligned with its values and priorities. For additional information about Citi’s human capital management initiatives and goals, see Citi’s 2022 ESG Report available

in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is included in Citi’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2023. Corporate Governance Guidelines Citi’s Corporate Governance Guidelines (the
Guidelines) embody many of our long-standing practices, policies, and procedures, which are the foundation of our commitment to best practices.
The Guidelines are reviewed at least annually, and revised as necessary, to continue to reflect best practices. The full text of the Guidelines,
as approved by the Board, is set forth on Citi’s website at www.citigroup.com. Click on “Investors,” then “Corporate
Governance,” and then “Corporate Governance Guidelines.” The Guidelines outline the responsibilities, operations, qualifications,
and composition of the Board. The following summarizes certain provisions of the Guidelines. Director Independence Our goal is that at least two-thirds of the members
of the Board be independent. Descriptions of our independence criteria and the results of the Board’s independence determinations
are set forth below. Board Committees The Guidelines require that all members of the following
committees of the Board be independent: Audit; Compensation, Performance Management and Culture; and Nomination, Governance and Public
Affairs. Committee members are appointed by the Board upon the recommendation of the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee.
Committee membership and Chairs are rotated periodically. The Board and each Committee have the power to hire and fire independent legal,
financial, or other advisors, as they may deem necessary, without consulting or obtaining the approval of management. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Corporate Governance 23 Additional Board Service In accordance with Citi’s Corporate Governance Guidelines,
subject to the discretion of the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, a Director may not serve on more than five for-profit
public company boards, including Citi’s Board, and a Director who is the Chief Executive Officer of a public company may not serve
on more than three for-profit public company boards, including Citi’s Board. Members of the Audit Committee may not serve on more
than three public company audit committees, including Citi’s Audit Committee. The number of other for-profit public and non-public
company boards and not-for-profit boards on which a Director may serve, including leadership positions on such for-profit and not-for-profit
boards, is subject to review and approval by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, in order to ensure that each Director
is able to devote sufficient time to performing his or her duties as a Director. This review is performed annually and the full Board,
based on a recommendation of the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, determines whether each Nominee can, based on his
or her outside board commitments, including committee memberships and leadership positions, devote sufficient time to performing his or
her duties as a Director of Citi. In addition to the annual review, if a director is considering joining a for-profit board, the Director
must advise the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, which will consider whether, after joining such board and any of
its committees, as well as assuming any leadership positions, the Director can continue to devote sufficient time to performing his or
her duties as a Director of Citi. In addition, under the Corporate Governance Guidelines, Board members are required to disclose significant
changes in professional responsibilities, including assuming a significant role in a not-for-profit entity, to the Nomination, Governance
and Public Affairs Committee for consideration. No Board nominee serves on more than four for-profit public
company boards and no Audit Committee member serves on more than three public company audit committees. Our CEO does not sit on any for-profit company boards besides Citi. For the 2024 slate of nominees for Citi’s Board, Citi’s Board of Directors, based on a
recommendation of the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, has determined, that upon consideration of the number of for-profit
public and non-public company boards and not-for-profit boards on which each Director serves, including committee memberships and leadership
positions on each of such for-profit and not-for-profit boards, that each nominee is able to devote sufficient time to performing his
or her duties as a Director of Citi. Change in Status or Responsibilities If a Director has a substantial change in professional
responsibilities, occupation, or business association, he or she is required to notify the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee
and to offer his or her resignation from the Board. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee will evaluate the facts and
circumstances and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept the resignation or request that the Director continue to serve
on the Board. If a Director assumes a significant role in a not-for-profit entity, he or she is asked to notify the Nomination, Governance
and Public Affairs Committee. Attendance at Meetings Directors are expected to attend Board meetings and
meetings of the Committees on which they serve, and the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All of the Directors then in office attended Citi’s
2023 Virtual Annual Meeting. Evaluation of Board Performance The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee
conducts an annual review of Board performance in which the full Board participates, and each standing committee (except for the Executive
Committee) conducts its own self-evaluation. As part of the self-evaluation, the Board engages in an examination of its own performance
of its obligations with regard to such matters as regulatory requirements, strategic and financial oversight, oversight of risk management,
executive compensation, succession planning, and governance, among many other topics. The committees evaluate their performance against
the requirements of their charters and other aspects of their responsibilities. The Board Chair conducts one-on-one interviews with each
board member. The full Board and each committee then discuss the results of their respective self-evaluations in executive session, highlighting
actions to be taken in response to the discussion. See Board Self-Assessment Process on page  30 for further information. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 24 Corporate Governance Directors Access to Senior Management and Director
Orientation Directors have full and free access to senior management
and other employees of Citi. New Directors are provided with an orientation program to familiarize them with Citi’s businesses and
functions, as well as its legal, compliance, regulatory, and risk profile. Citi provides educational sessions on a variety of topics throughout
the year for all members of the Board. These sessions are designed to allow Directors to develop a deeper understanding of, for example,
a business issue or a complex financial product. Succession Planning The Board reviews the Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee’s report on the
performance of senior executives to evaluate whether they are providing the highest quality leadership for Citi. The
Board also works with the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee to evaluate potential successors
to the CEO. With respect to regular succession of the CEO and senior management, Citi’s Board evaluates internal,
and, when appropriate, external candidates. To find external candidates, Citi seeks input from the members of the
Board, senior management, and from recruiting firms. To develop internal candidates, Citi engages in a number
of practices, formal and informal, designed to familiarize the Board with Citi’s talent pool. The formal process
involves an annual talent review conducted by senior management at which the Board studies the most promising
members of senior management. The Board learns about each person’s experience, skills, areas of expertise,
accomplishments, and goals. This review is conducted at a regularly scheduled Board meeting on an annual basis.
In addition, members of senior management are periodically asked to make presentations to the Board at Board
meetings and Board strategy sessions. These presentations are made by senior managers of the various business
units as well as those who serve in corporate functions. The purpose of the formal review and other interaction is to
familiarize Board members with the talent pool inside and outside Citi from which the Board would be able to choose
successors to the CEO and evaluate succession for other senior managers as necessary from time to time. Charitable Contributions If a Director, or an immediate family member who shares
the Director’s household, serves as a director, trustee, or executive officer of a foundation, university, or other not-for-profit
organization, and such entity receives contributions from Citi and/or the Citi Foundation, such contributions must be reported to the
Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee at least annually. Insider Investments and Transactions Members of Citi’s Board of Directors and Citi’s
executive officers (i.e., Section 16 Insiders) are not permitted to hedge their Citi securities or to pledge their Citi securities as
collateral for a loan. The Guidelines restrict certain financial transactions between Citi and its subsidiaries on the one hand and Directors,
senior management, and their immediate family members on the other. Personal loans from Citi or its subsidiaries to Citi’s Directors
and its most senior executives, or immediate family members who share any such person’s household, are prohibited, except for margin
loans to employees of a broker-dealer subsidiary of Citi, mortgage loans, home equity loans, consumer loans, credit cards, and overdraft
checking privileges, all made on market terms in the ordinary course of business. See Certain Transactions and Relationships,
Compensation Committee Interlocks, and Insider Participation on pages 38–40. The Guidelines prohibit investments or transactions
by Citi or its executive officers and those immediate family members who share an executive officer’s household in a partnership
or other privately held entity in which an outside Director is a principal, or in a publicly traded company in which an outside Director
owns or controls more than a 10% interest. Directors and those immediate family members who share the Director’s household are not
permitted to receive initial public offering allocations. Directors and their immediate family members may participate in Citi-sponsored
investment activities, provided they are offered on the same terms as those offered to similarly situated non-affiliated persons. Under
certain circumstances, or with the approval of the appropriate Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Corporate Governance 25 committee, members of senior management may participate
in certain Citi-sponsored investment opportunities. Finally, there is a prohibition on certain investments by Directors and executive
officers in third-party entities when the opportunity comes solely as a result of their position with Citi. Director Independence The Board has adopted categorical standards to assist
the Board in evaluating the independence of each of its Directors. The categorical standards, which are set forth below, describe various
types of relationships that could potentially exist between a Director or an immediate family member of a Director and Citi, and set thresholds
at which such relationships would be deemed to be material. Provided that no relationship or transaction exists that would disqualify
a Director under the categorical standards and no other relationships or transactions exist of a type not specifically mentioned in the
categorical standards that, in the Board’s opinion, taking into account all facts and circumstances, would impair a Director’s
ability to exercise his or her independent judgment, the Board will deem such person to be independent. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs
Committee reviewed certain information obtained from Directors’ responses to a questionnaire asking about their relationships
with Citi, and those of their immediate family members and primary business or charitable affiliations and other potential conflicts
of interest, as well as certain data collected by Citi’s businesses related to transactions, relationships, or arrangements
between Citi on the one hand and a Director, immediate family member of a Director, or a primary business or charitable affiliation
of a Director, on the other. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee also reviewed certain relationships or
transactions between the Directors or immediate family members of the Directors or their primary business or charitable affiliations
and Citi and determined that the relationships or transactions complied with the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the related
categorical standards. The Board, based on the recommendation of the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, determined
that, applying the Guidelines and standards, which are intended to comply with the NYSE corporate governance rules, and all other
applicable laws, rules, and regulations, each of the following Director nominees standing for re-election is independent: ● Ellen
    M. Costello ● Grace
    E. Dailey ● Barbara
    J. Desoer ● John
    C. Dugan ● Duncan
    P. Hennes ● Peter
    B. Henry ● S.
    Leslie Ireland ● Renée
    J. James ● Gary
    M. Reiner ● Diana
    L. Taylor ● James
    S. Turley ● Casper
    W. von Koskull The Board has determined that Jane N. Fraser, our
Chief Executive Officer, is not independent. Independence Standards To be considered independent, a Director must meet
the following categorical standards as adopted by our Board and reflected in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. In addition, there are
other independence standards under NYSE corporate governance rules that apply to all directors and certain independence standards under
SEC, Federal Reserve Board, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) rules that apply to specific committees. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 26 Corporate Governance Categorical Standards Advisory, Consulting and Employment

charitable organization’s annual consolidated gross revenue. Employment/Affiliations ● A Director shall not: (i) be or have been an employee of the Company within the last three years; (ii) be part of, or within the past three years have been part of, an interlocking directorate in which a

Transactions The Board may determine
that a Director is independent notwithstanding the existence of an immaterial relationship or transaction between Citi and (i) the Director,
(ii) an immediate family member of the Director or (iii) the Director’s or immediate family member’s business or charitable
affiliations, provided Citi’s Proxy Statement includes a specific description of such relationship as well as the basis for the
Board’s determination that such relationship does not preclude a determination that the Director is independent. Relationships or
transactions between Citi and (i) the Director, (ii) an immediate family member of the Director or (iii) the Director’s or immediate
family member’s business or charitable affiliations that comply with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, including, but not limited
to, the Director Independence Standards that are part of the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the sections titled Financial Services,
Personal Loans and Investments/Transactions, are deemed to be categorically immaterial and do not require disclosure in the Proxy Statement
(unless such relationship or transaction is required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K). Definitions For purposes of these Corporate Governance
Guidelines, (i) the term “immediate family member” means a Director’s or executive officer’s (designated as
such pursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) spouse, parents, step-parents,
children, step-children, siblings, mother- and father-in law, sons- and daughters-in-law, and brothers- and sisters-in-law and any
person (other than a tenant or domestic employee) who shares the Director’s household; (ii) the term “Primary Business
Affiliation” means an entity of which the Director or executive officer, or an immediate family member of such a person, is an
officer, partner or employee or in which the Director, executive officer or immediate family member owns directly or indirectly at
least a 5% equity interest; and (iii) the term “Related Party Transaction” means any financial transaction, arrangement
or relationship in which (a) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, (b) Citi
is a participant, and (c) any Related Person (any Director, any executive officer of Citi, any nominee for Director, any shareholder
owning in excess of 5% of the total equity of Citi, and any immediate family member of any such person) has or will have a direct or
indirect material interest. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 28 Corporate Governance Meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees The Board of Directors met 24 times in 2023. Citi’s
standing Board Committees met as follows: the Audit Committee met 20 times, the Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee
met 12 times, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee met 7 times, the Risk Management Committee met 16 times, and the
Technology Committee met 10 times. The Executive Committee did not meet in 2023. During 2023, all independent members of the
Board served on and/or chaired one or more ad hoc committees, including the Transformation Oversight Committee, or served on an international
subsidiary board. In addition, Mses. Dailey, Desoer, Fraser, Ireland, and Taylor and Messrs. Hennes and Turley served on the Board of
Directors of Citibank, N.A., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Citi. Each incumbent Director attended at least 88% of the
meetings of the Board and of the standing committees of which he or she was a member during 2023. Meetings of Non-Management Directors Citi’s non-management Directors meet in executive
session without any management Directors in attendance whenever the full Board convenes for a regularly scheduled meeting. During 2023,
Mr. Dugan presided at each executive session of the non-management Directors. Board Leadership Structure Citi currently has an independent Chair separate from the CEO, a structure that has been in place since 2009. The
Board believes it is important to maintain flexibility in its Board leadership structure and has had in place different
leadership structures in the past, depending on the Company’s needs at the time, but firmly supports having an
independent Director in a Board leadership position at all times. Accordingly, Citi’s Board, on December 15, 2009,
adopted a By-law amendment that provides that if Citi does not have an Independent Chair, the Board will elect a
lead independent Director having similar duties to an independent Chair, including leading the executive sessions
of the non-management Directors at Board meetings. Citi’s Chair provides independent leadership of the Board. Having an independent Chair or Lead Director enables
non-management Directors to raise issues and concerns
for Board consideration without immediately involving
management. The Chair or Lead Director also serves as
a liaison between the Board and senior management and
regularly meets with Citi’s stockholders, stakeholders,
and regulators on behalf of the Company. Citi’s Board has determined that the current structure, an independent
Chair separate from the CEO, is the most appropriate structure at this time, while ensuring that, at all times, there
will be an independent Director in a Board leadership position. The Board believes its approach to risk oversight,
which includes: (i) a report at every regular Board meeting from the Chief Risk Officer on significant risk matters for
discussion with the Board, (ii) a standing Risk Management Committee of the Board and (iii) a direct reporting line
of the Chief Risk Officer to the Risk Management Committee, that enables the Board to choose many leadership
structures without experiencing a material impact on its oversight of risk. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Corporate Governance 29 Board Diversity Diversity
is among the critical factors that the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee considers when evaluating the composition
of the Board. For a Company like Citi, which operates in more than 100 countries around the globe, diversity includes race,
ethnicity, nationality, and gender as well as the diversity of the communities and geographies in which Citi operates. Included in
the qualifications for Directors listed in the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines is “whether the candidate has
special skills, expertise and background that would complement the attributes of the existing Directors, taking into consideration
the diverse communities and geographies in which Citi operates.” Citi’s Board is committed to building a Board that is
composed of individuals whose backgrounds reflect the diversity represented by our employees, customers, and stakeholders. When
considering new Director candidates, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee instructs its recruiting firm to
include diverse candidates in each slate. In this context, eight of the candidates nominated for election at Citi’s 2024
Annual Meeting are diverse. In addition, each Director candidate contributes to the Board’s overall diversity by providing a
variety of perspectives, personal and professional experiences, and backgrounds, as well as other characteristics, such as global
and international business experience. The Board believes that the current nominees reflect an appropriate diversity of gender, age,
race, national origin, geographical background, and experience and is committed to continuing to consider diversity and assess its
effectiveness in this regard in evaluating the composition of the Board. Director Education Program Citi has a robust Director Education Program
that begins with an orientation for newly appointed Directors, providing two days of in-depth training covering all aspects of our
business, including, among other things, coverage of Citi’s new organizational model, including the following five business
lines: (1) Services, which includes both Treasury & Trade Solutions and Securities Services; (2) Banking, which includes
Investment Banking and Corporate Lending; (3) Markets; (4) U.S. Personal Banking; and (5) Wealth. In
addition, the new Directors’ orientation includes
training sessions that provide an overview of the Company’s risk management, audit, compliance, operations and technology,
governance, regulatory, finance, human capital management, government affairs, and legal functions; and an overview of Citi’s
primary banking subsidiary, Citibank, N.A. There is also a continuing education program, which includes presentations focusing on
industry, regulatory and governance topics and presentations from the various lines of our business on emerging issues or strategic
initiatives to provide our Directors with the opportunity to expand their insight into Citi’s business operations and
activities. Directors also have access to external programming and seminars to supplement their Citi-provided education. In 2023,
the Directors received training on various topics, including Environmental and Sustainability matters, Political Contributions, Net
Zero, Generative AI, Cybersecurity, Regulation O, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair Lending, Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering,
Risk Appetite, Fixed Income Currencies and Commodities, Wealth, Corporate and Commercial Banking and International Business
Franchises, among other topics. The Transformation Oversight Committee has a separate training program whereby the members of the
Committee receive training on topics related to the Transformation Program. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 30 Corporate Governance Board Self-Assessment Process Annual

to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi has established an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework to manage Citi’s risks appropriately and consistently across Citi and at an aggregate, enterprise-wide level. The ERM Framework details the
principles used to support effective enterprise-wide risk management across the end-to-end risk management lifecycle. The ERM Framework
also provides clarity on risk management roles and responsibilities of the Citigroup Board of Directors, Citi’s Executive Management
Team and employees across the lines of defense. Citi’s culture and values drive a strong risk and control environment, and are at
the heart of the ERM Framework, underpinning the way Citi conducts business. The activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those
activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition and the key principles that guide it, as well
as Citi’s risk appetite. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Corporate Governance 31 The Citi Board of Directors is responsible for
oversight of risk management and holds the Executive Management Team accountable for implementing the ERM Framework and managing
risk within the defined risk appetite as it meets its strategic objectives. The Board’s Transformation Oversight Committee
oversees management’s progress as it relates to the broader transformation of Citi and management’s remediation of
issues identified under the Consent Order, dated October 7, 2020, entered into by Citi with the Federal Reserve Board (FRB Consent
Order), including issues related to our risk and control environment. A similar Committee was formed by the Citibank, N.A. (CBNA)
Board to provide oversight of management’s remediation of issues identified under the Consent Order, dated October 7, 2020,
entered into by CBNA with the OCC (OCC Consent Order and together with the FRB Consent Order, the Consent Orders). (Please see page
32 to review additional disclosure on the Transformation Oversight Committee.) In addition, the Board of Directors has delegated
oversight of specific risks, as set forth below, to certain other Board committees, based on their mandates. Citi uses a lines of defense model as a key component
of its ERM Framework to manage its risks. The lines of defense model brings together risk-taking, risk oversight and risk assurance under
one umbrella and provides an avenue for risk accountability of the first line of defense, a construct for effective challenge by the second
line of defense (Independent Risk Management and Independent Compliance Risk Management), and empowers independent risk assurance by the
third line of defense (Internal Audit). Citi has enterprise support functions that support safety and soundness across Citi. Each of the
lines of defense and enterprise support functions, along with the Board, are empowered to perform relevant risk management processes and
responsibilities in order to manage Citi’s risks within the defined risk appetite in a consistent and effective manner. For more information about Citi’s risk management,
see the “Managing Global Risk” section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023

receives a risk report from the Chief Risk Officer with respect to the Company’s approach to management of major risks, including
management’s risk mitigation efforts, where appropriate. Independent Risk Management, led by the Chief Risk Officer, sets risk and
control standards for the first line of defense and actively manages and oversees aggregate credit, market (trading and non-trading),
liquidity, strategic, operational and reputation risks across Citi, including risks that span categories, such as concentration risk,
country risk, compliance risk, and climate risk. The Board’s role is to oversee this effort. The Risk Management Committee enhances the Board’s
oversight of risk management. The Committee’s role is one of oversight, recognizing that management is responsible for executing
Citi’s risk management policies. Transformation Enhancements at Citi Citi is fully committed to a broad-based transformation
of its risk management and controls. Citi believes the Transformation is essential, not only to address regulatory matters in an effective,
timely, and sustainable manner, but also as a broader strategic imperative for the firm. Citi’s priorities revolve around three
interconnected elements: the Transformation, strategy, and culture and talent. Driving toward excellence in risk and controls in the Transformation
is mutually reinforcing with Citi’s business strategy, and success for both can only be achieved with significant shifts in culture
and talent. The Board established the Transformation Oversight
Committee in October 2020, to serve as the primary forum for Board oversight of the Transformation. Given this overall responsibility
of the Transformation Oversight Committee and the need for holistic oversight, all non-management directors on the Board serve on the
Committee. The full Board focuses on non-Transformation matters in other forums. A series of Program Groups focus on specific requirements
of the Consent Order. Certain members of the Transformation Oversight Committee (Lead Directors) who have been assigned to the various
Program Groups, work closely with the Executive Management Team members responsible for the relevant Program Groups to provide oversight
and challenge to the Program Groups as they prepare for meetings with the entire Transformation Oversight Committee, in much the same
way as Board Committee Chairs interact with individual senior management team members in preparation for committee meetings. Board’s Role in Technology Oversight The Board directly or through one or more Committees
provides oversight of Management’s efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risk and respond to cyber incidents. The Board is briefed in
full at least annually, and one or more Committees receive regular reports on cybersecurity and engage in discussions throughout the year
with Management and subject-matter experts on the effectiveness of Citi’s overall cybersecurity program, cybersecurity risks, Citi’s
strategies for addressing these risks, and Citi’s implementation thereof. The Board participates in periodic cybersecurity tabletop
exercises. Additionally, Board and/or Committee members receive reporting on significant cyber events including response efforts, legal
obligations, and outreach and notification to regulators and/or customers when needed, as well as provide guidance to management as appropriate.
The Risk Management Committee has approved a standalone Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement against which Citi’s performance is
measured quarterly. The Technology Committee also oversees technology
matters as discussed on page  37 of this proxy statement. The Committee also has primary oversight for emerging technologies such
as Generative Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, including the risks or benefits related to emerging technologies.
Members of the Technology Committee bring meaningful insight and expertise into how artificial intelligence technologies intersect
with the financial services industry, further strengthening the Board’s oversight of this important area. Board’s Role in Environmental and Social Matters Citi’s Board of Directors has ultimate oversight
of Citi’s work to identify, assess and integrate environmental and social-related risks and opportunities throughout Citi. In addition to
oversight by the full Board, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee of the Board oversees Citi’s ESG
activity, including reviewing our policies and programs for sustainability, climate change, human rights and diversity, equity and inclusion. The Risk Management
Committee of the Board reviews key risk policies, including those related to environmental, social and climate risk. The Audit Committee
has oversight over the controls and procedures related to Citi’s group level ESG and climate-related reporting, including both voluntary
disclosures and regulatory filings. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee has held a number of meetings to review stockholder
proposals and received an environmental and social priorities update in 2023. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Corporate Governance 33 During 2023, the Risk Management Committee received
updates on climate risk, and the Audit Committee reviewed existing ESG-related disclosure controls and procedures. The Board
also received reports from the Head of Community Investing and Development on Citi and the Citi Foundation’s social impact activities
and performance, including Action for Racial Equity and the investments of the Citi Impact Fund. In addition, the Board received
reports on Citi’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts from the Global Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer and Global
Head of Talent. Members of the Board also participated in investor calls on a variety of governance and environmental and social matters,
including climate risk. Committees of the Board of Directors Below are the standing committees of the Board
of Directors. In addition, the Board of Directors has an ad hoc committee, the Transformation Oversight Committee, which oversees
management’s efforts to enhance its risk and control environment and achieve operational excellence. (Please see page 32 to

    Board has determined that each of Mses. Costello and Dailey and Messrs. Dugan, Hennes, and Turley qualifies as an “audit committee
    financial expert” as defined by the SEC and each such Director as well as Ms. James is considered “financially literate”
    under NYSE rules, and, in addition to being independent according to the Board’s independence standards as set out in its Corporate

    and the FDIC guidelines. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 34 Corporate Governance Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee Committee Roles and Responsibilities: The Compensation, Performance Management and Culture
    Committee has been delegated broad authority to oversee compensation of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates,
    as well as the authority to oversee management’s sustained focus on fostering a principled culture of sound ethics, responsible
    conduct and accountability within the organization. The Committee regularly reviews Citi’s management resources and performance
    of senior management. The Committee is responsible for determining the compensation for the CEO and approving the compensation of other
    executive officers of the Company and the Executive Management Team. The Committee is also responsible for approving the incentive compensation
    structure for other members of senior management and certain highly compensated employees (including discretionary incentive awards to
    covered employees as defined in applicable bank regulatory guidance), in accordance with guidelines established by the Committee from
    time to time. The Committee also has broad oversight of compliance with bank regulatory guidance governing Citi’s incentive compensation. The Committee receives reports from management on efforts
    to foster and support Citi’s desired culture and promote ethical decision-making in the organization via training or other initiatives,
    including management’s efforts to achieve its target culture state and to encourage employees to escalate issues and share feedback
    without fear of retaliation. The Committee also reviews at least annually whether Citi’s Code of Conduct instills appropriate ethical
    behavior in Citi’s culture, business practices and employees and recommends any proposed changes or waivers to the Board for approval.
    The Committee reviews certain concerns reported to the Citi Ethics Office as appropriate. The Committee annually reviews and discusses the Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis required to be included in the Company’s Proxy Statement with management, and, if appropriate, recommends
    to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included. Additionally, the Committee reviews and approves the overall goals
    of Citi’s material incentive compensation programs, including as expressed through Citi’s Compensation Philosophy, and provides
    oversight for Citi’s incentive compensation programs so that they both: (i) appropriately balance risk and financial results in a
    manner that does not encourage employees to expose Citi to imprudent risks, and (ii) are consistent with bank safety and soundness. Toward
    that end, the Committee meets periodically with Citi’s Chief Risk Officer to discuss the risk attributes of Citi’s incentive
    compensation programs. The Committee has the power to hire and fire
    independent compensation consultants, legal counsel, or financial or other advisors as it may deem necessary to assist it in the
    performance of its duties and responsibilities, without consulting or obtaining the approval of senior management of the Company.
    The Committee has retained Frederic W. Cook & Co. (FW Cook) to provide the Committee with advice on Citi’s compensation
    programs for senior management. The Committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees, comprised of one or more members of the Committee, as necessary or appropriate. The Board has determined that in addition to being
    independent according to the Board’s independence standards as set out in its Corporate Governance Guidelines, each of the members
    of the Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee is independent according to the corporate governance rules of the NYSE.
    Each of such Directors is a “non-employee Director,” as defined in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Members: Duncan P. Hennes (Chair) Peter B. Henry Renée J. James Gary M.

Director, officer, BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock) or The Vanguard Group (Vanguard) (each of which owns more than 5% of Citi’s
common stock), or any affiliate thereof, is a party adverse to Citi or in which any such person has a material interest adverse to
Citi. Certain Transactions
and Relationships, Compensation Committee Interlocks, and Insider Participation The Board has adopted a procedure setting forth procedures
for the review, approval, and monitoring of transactions involving Citi and related persons (Directors, Senior Managers, 5% stockholders,
Immediate Family Members or Primary Business Affiliations). A copy of Citi’s Procedure on Related Party Transactions is available
on our website at www.citigroup.com. Click on “Investors,” then “Corporate Governance,” and then “Citi Policies.”
Under the procedure, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party
transactions involving Directors, Immediate Family Members of Directors, and 5% stockholders. Directors may not participate in any discussion
or approval of a related party transaction in which he or she or any member of his or her immediate family is a related person, except
that the Director must provide all material information concerning the related party transaction to the Nomination, Governance and Public
Affairs Committee. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee is also responsible for reviewing and approving all related
party transactions valued at more than $120,000 involving an executive officer or an Immediate Family Member of an executive officer.
The policy also contains a list of categories of transactions involving related persons that are pre-approved under the policy, and therefore
need not be brought to the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee for approval. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee
will review the following information when assessing a related party transaction: ● the terms of such transaction; ● the related person’s interest
in the transaction; ● the purpose and timing of the transaction; ● whether Citi is a party to the transaction,
and if not, the nature of Citi’s participation in the transaction; ● if the transaction involves the
sale of an asset, a description of the asset, including date acquired and cost basis; ● information concerning potential
counterparties in the transaction; ● the approximate dollar value of
the transaction and the approximate dollar value of the related person’s interest in the transaction; ● a description of any provisions
or limitations imposed as a result of entering into the proposed transaction; ● whether the proposed transaction
includes any potential reputational risk issues that may arise as a result of, or in connection with, the proposed transaction; and ● any other relevant information regarding
the transaction. Based on information contained in a Schedule 13G/A filed
with the SEC, BlackRock and Vanguard each reported that they beneficially owned 5% or more of the outstanding shares of Citi’s common
stock as of December 31, 2023 — see Stock Ownership — Owners of More than 5% of Citi Common Stock on page 45.
During 2023, our subsidiaries provided ordinary course lending, trading, and other financial services to BlackRock and Vanguard and their
respective affiliates and clients. Citi and its subsidiaries may also, in the ordinary course, invest or offer to Citi’s clients,
BlackRock or Vanguard mutual funds or other products. In addition, affiliates of BlackRock offer certain investment options under our
401-K plan. These transactions were entered into on an arm’s length basis and contain customary terms and
conditions and were on substantially the same terms as comparable transactions with unrelated third parties. In 2018, Acciones y Valores
Banamex, S.A. de C.V., Servicios Corporativos de Finanzas, S.A. de C.V., and Grupo Financiero Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 39 Citibanamex, S.A. de C.V. (Citibanamex) entered into
an agreement with BlackRock, Inc. and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which BlackRock acquired the asset management business of
Citibanamex in Mexico. The transaction included the sale of the Impulsora de Fondos Banamex, S.A. de C.V. (Impulsora) legal vehicle, and
its advisory role for 52 mutual funds and certain managed account relationships, and certain intellectual property and vendor contracts
required to operate the business. Consideration for the sale consisted of $350 million and certain future payments if defined targets
were met. In connection with the closing, Citibanamex and BlackRock also entered into a long-term distribution agreement (the Services
Framework Agreement) to offer BlackRock asset management products to Citibanamex clients in Mexico. The agreement provides a framework
under which Citibanamex distributes BlackRock products in Mexico and includes terms relating to pricing, preferential access, and product
support. Pursuant to this agreement, fees of approximately $94 million were paid to Blackrock in 2023. The Nomination, Governance and
Public Affairs Committee reviewed the terms of the sale and approved the transaction in accordance with the Procedure on Related Party
Transactions. In January 2023, Citibanamex and BlackRock executed
an amendment to the Services Framework Agreement (the 2023 Amendment). The 2023 Amendment provides for investment commitments from Citibanamex
that are consistent with historical expenditures, and termination of certain rights and guarantees if certain conditions are met. The
Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee reviewed and approved the terms of the 2023 Amendment in accordance with the Procedure
on Related Party Transactions, and the Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc. approved the 2023 Amendment in accordance with its Major Expenditure
Program. Citigroup Venture Capital International Growth Partnership
II, L.P. is a private equity investment fund that was formed in 2007. Citi established this fund in which employees have invested, including
certain of our executive officers. Executive officers were not eligible to participate in this fund on a leveraged basis. Other than certain
“grandfathered” investments, in accordance with Sarbanes-Oxley and the Citi Corporate Governance Guidelines, executive officers
were able to invest in certain Citi-sponsored investment opportunities only under certain circumstances and with the approval of the appropriate
committee. In 2023, there were no distributions from the fund to executive officers that exceeded $120,000. In 2023, Citi performed corporate banking and securities
brokerage services in the ordinary course of our business for certain organizations in which some of our Directors, executive officers,
or their family members, are officers or directors. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Citi may use the products or services
of organizations in which some of our Directors, executive officers, or family members, are officers or directors. The persons listed on page 103 are the current
members of the Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee. No current or former member of the Compensation,
Performance Management and Culture Committee was a part of a “compensation committee interlock” during fiscal year 2023
as described under SEC rules. In addition, none of our executive officers served as a director or member of the compensation
committee of another entity that would constitute a “compensation committee interlock.” No member of the Compensation,
Performance Management and Culture Committee had any material interest in a transaction with Citi or is a current or former officer
of Citi, and no member of the Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee is a current employee of Citi or any of its
subsidiaries. In addition, no member of the Board, or any immediate family member of the Board, engaged FW Cook for any
compensation-related services in 2023. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 40 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE A sibling of Sara Wechter, Citi’s Chief
Human Resources Officer, has been employed by Citi since 2008, first as an intern and then, beginning in 2010, as a full-time
employee. She is employed by Citi’s USPB and received 2023 compensation of $1,803,821. A sister-in-law of Peter
Babej, Citi’s Interim Head of Banking, was employed by Citi from 2017 to 2023. She received 2023 compensation of $179,426. A
sibling of Shahmir Khaliq, Citi’s Head of Services, has worked in Citi’s Finance Division since 2018 and received 2023
compensation of $193,820. The compensation for these employees was established by Citi in accordance with its employment and
compensation practices applicable to employees with equivalent qualifications and responsibilities and holding similar positions.
Ms. Wechter and Messrs. Babej and Khaliq do not have an interest in the employment relationship of, nor do they share a household
with, their respective family members who are employees of Citi. Indebtedness In accordance with Sarbanes-Oxley and the Citi Corporate
Governance Guidelines, no margin loans may be made to any executive officer unless such person is an employee of a broker-dealer subsidiary
of Citi and such loan is made in the ordinary course of business. Certain transactions in excess of $120,000 involving
loans, deposits, credit cards, and sales of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and other money market instruments and certain
other banking transactions occurred during 2023 between Citibank, N.A. and other Citi banking subsidiaries on the one hand, and certain
Directors or executive officers of Citi, members of their immediate families, corporations or organizations of which any of them is an
executive officer or partner or of which any of them is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of any class of securities, or associates
of the Directors, the executive officers or their family members, on the other. The transactions were made in the ordinary course of business
on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, that prevailed at the time for comparable transactions with
other persons not related to the lender and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.
Personal loans made to any Director or an executive officer must comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, Regulation O, and the Corporate Governance
Guidelines, and must be made in the ordinary course of business. Citi’s Hedging Policies Citi’s Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit
the hedging of Citi common stock held by Directors and executive officers, whether the shares of stock are granted as compensation or
are otherwise held by the director or executive officer. For this purpose, an executive officer means any person designated by Citi as
an “officer” under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Citi’s Code of Conduct, which applies to all
Citi employees, executive officers and Directors, states that when considering personal investments in Citi securities, an individual
must avoid any personal trade or investment in a security, derivative, futures contract, commodity, or other financial instrument if the
trade or investment might affect or appear to affect the individual’s ability to make unbiased business decisions for Citi. In addition, Citi’s Personal Trading and Investment
Policy (the PTIP) prohibits the hedging in any manner (other than currency hedges) by Covered Persons (including directors and executive
officers) of unvested restricted stock or deferred stock awarded as compensation under Citi’s Capital Accumulation Program. The
PTIP also prohibits engaging in speculative transactions in Citi securities, including sales of naked calls and speculative option strategies,
as well as any other transaction that would benefit from a decline in the value of a Citi security. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 41 The PTIP generally allows Covered Persons (excluding
directors and executive officers) to hedge vested long positions of then deliverable Citi securities. Covered Persons under the PTIP include
(but are not limited to) individuals who 1) may have access to material non-public information regarding Citi, 2) are employed by Citi’s
Institutional Clients Group, 3) are FINRA-registered employees or associates of any of Citi’s U.S. broker-dealer entities, or 4)
work in a securities or advisory business in Wealth, as well as certain individuals who are related to Covered
Persons. Because directors and executive officers who are Covered Persons under the PTIP are also subject to the hedging policy applicable
to directors and executive officers pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, a proposed transaction by a director or executive
officer may be prohibited by application of one policy even if the transaction would be permissible under the other policy. Finally, Citi maintains policies specific to U.K.
and European regulatory requirements. These policies provide that all employees in the applicable countries who receive a portion of their
remuneration in stock or any other deferral mechanism designated by Citi must not take out insurance contracts or engage in personal hedging
strategies, or remuneration or liability-related contracts of insurance, that undermine, or may undermine, any risk alignment effects
of their remuneration arrangements. Reputation Risk Committee The Reputation Risk Committee, a management
level committee, governs the process by which material reputation risks are identified, measured, monitored, controlled and
reported, and oversees that appropriate actions are taken in line with the firmwide strategic objectives, risk appetite thresholds,
and regulatory expectations, while promoting a culture of risk awareness and high standards of integrity and ethical behavior across
the company, consistent with Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition. Business Reputation Risk Forums may escalate reputation
risks for due consideration by the Group Reputation Risk Committee at the corporate level. The Group Reputation Risk Committee may
escalate risks to the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee of the Board or another Committee of the Board, as
appropriate. Ethics, Conduct and Culture At Citi, our mission is to serve as a trusted partner
to our clients by responsibly providing financial services that enable growth and economic progress. We foster a culture of ethics through our governance
framework, programs and efforts that embed our culture and expectations for behavior throughout the organization, and collaboration with
key stakeholders outside Citi to improve Citi’s and the banking industry’s culture. Governance over Culture The cornerstone of our approach to culture is our
governance framework, which begins with a strong “tone from the top” starting with the Citigroup Board of Directors. Citi’s
Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee of the Board oversees senior management’s sustained focus on efforts
to foster a culture of ethics, appropriate conduct, and accountability throughout Citi. For more information, please see the Compensation,
Performance Management and Culture Committee Charter, which is set forth on Citi’s website at www.citigroup.com. Click on “Investors,”
then “Corporate Governance,” and then “Citigroup Board of Directors’ Committee Charters.” www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 42 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE With oversight from the Compensation, Performance
Management and Culture Committee, senior management has undertaken a number of efforts in support of Citi’s culture, including developing
Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition and Leadership Principles. On an ongoing basis, the Compensation, Performance Management and
Culture Committee remains responsible for overseeing senior management’s efforts to reinforce sound ethics, responsible conduct
and principled culture within Citi, which includes: ● overseeing efforts to enhance and
communicate Citi’s principles relating to ethics and responsible conduct, and its expectations of employee behavior, including
their expression in Citi’s tone from the top and Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition, evaluating management’s progress,
and providing feedback on these efforts; ● overseeing management’s efforts
to support Citi’s desired culture and ethical decision-making in the organization, evaluating management’s progress and providing
feedback on these efforts; and ● reviewing Citi’s Code of Conduct
and Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals. Programs and Efforts that Embed Culture To promote a culture of ethics and appropriate conduct,
Citi focuses on empowering individuals by establishing global policies, programs, and processes that embed our values throughout the organization
and guide and support our employees in making ethical decisions and adhering to Citi’s standards of conduct. Under the oversight
of, and with input and feedback from, the Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee, senior management has prioritized
a number of efforts to further embed our values and conduct expectations into the organization. The following are a few examples of our
programs and associated efforts to set, reinforce, and embed our culture at Citi: ● Communications and awareness
efforts concerning our Mission and Value Proposition, including Citi-wide videos from senior management articulating our core principles
and providing examples of these principles in action. ● Embedding the Leadership Principles
into key aspects of our employee life cycle, such as hiring and performance reviews. ● Training of employees on key
culture-related themes, including our Code of Conduct, ethical decision-making, and the importance of leadership. Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals The Citi Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals
applies to Citi’s Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer), Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) and
Controller (Principal Accounting Officer) and all Finance Professionals and Administrative Staff in a finance role, including but not
limited to Controllers, Finance & Risk Shared Services (FRSS), Capital Planning, Financial Planning & Analysis, Productivity and
Strategy, Treasury, Tax, M&A, Investor Relations and the Regional/Business teams. Citi expects all of its employees to act in accordance
with the highest standards of personal and professional integrity in all aspects of their activities, to comply with all applicable laws,
rules, and regulations, to deter wrongdoing, and to abide by the Citi Code of Conduct and other policies and procedures adopted by Citi
that govern the conduct of its employees. The Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals is intended to supplement the Citi Code of Conduct.
A copy of the Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals is available on our website at www.citigroup.com. Click on “Investors,”
then “Corporate Governance,” and then “Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals.” We will disclose amendments
to, or waivers from, the Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals, if any, on our website. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 43 Ethics Hotline Citi expects members of its workforce to promptly
raise concerns if they have any reason to believe that any Citi employee, or anyone working on Citi’s behalf, may have engaged in
misconduct, which includes violations or potential violations of law, regulation, rule, or breaches of Citi policy, standard, procedure,
or the Citi Code of Conduct. Citi offers several channels by which employees and others may report ethical concerns, including concerns
about accounting, internal controls, or auditing matters. We provide a global Ethics Hotline, a toll-free number that is available 24
hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and is staffed by live operators who can connect to translators to accommodate multiple
languages. Calls to the Ethics Hotline are received by a third-party vendor, located in the United States. Individuals raising concerns via the Ethics Hotline may choose to remain anonymous. Citi prohibits retaliatory actions against anyone who raises concerns or questions in good faith, or who participates in a subsequent investigation of such concerns. Any individual, including members of the public without
a work-based relationship to Citi, may also raise a concern by accessing the global Ethics Hotline via Citi’s public-facing corporate
website. Code of Conduct The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct, which provides an overview of certain laws, regulations, and select
Citi policies standards, and procedures applicable to the activities of Citi. It also sets forth Citi’s Mission and Value
Proposition, as well as the standards of ethics and professional behavior expected of employees and representatives
of Citi. The Code of Conduct applies to every director, officer, and employee of Citi and its consolidated subsidiaries.
All Citi employees, directors, and officers are required to read and comply with the Code of Conduct. We will disclose
waivers from the Code of Conduct for our directors, if any, on our website. In addition, other persons performing
services for Citi may be subject to the Code of Conduct by contract or other agreement. The Code of Conduct is
publicly available in multiple languages at www.citigroup.com. Click on “Investors,” then “Corporate Governance,”
and then “Code of Conduct.” Communications with the Board Stockholders or other interested parties who wish
to communicate with a member or members of the Board, including the Chair or the non-management Directors as a group, may do so by addressing
their correspondence to the Board member or members, c/o the Corporate Secretary, Brent J. McIntosh, Citigroup Inc., 388 Greenwich Street,
New York, NY 10013. The Board of Directors has approved a process pursuant to which the office of the Corporate Secretary will review
and forward correspondence to the appropriate person or persons for response. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 44 Stock Ownership Citi has long encouraged stock ownership by its Directors,
officers, and employees to align their interests with the long-term interests of stockholders. The Board and executive officers are subject
to a stock ownership commitment, which requires these individuals to maintain a minimum ownership level of Citigroup stock. Executive
officers are required to retain at least 75% of the equity awarded to them as incentive compensation (net of amounts required to pay
taxes and option exercise prices) as long as they are executive officers. In addition, a stock holding period applies after the executive
officer leaves Citi or is no longer an executive officer. He or she must retain, for one year after ending executive officer status,
50% of the shares previously subject to the stock ownership commitment. Directors are similarly required to retain at least 75% of the
net equity awarded to them, further aligning their interests with stockholders. The Board may revise the terms of the stock ownership
commitment from time to time to reflect legal and business developments warranting a change. In addition, Directors and executive officers
may not enter into hedging transactions in respect of Citi’s common stock or other securities issued by Citi, including securities
granted by the Company to the Director or executive officer as part of his or her compensation and securities purchased or acquired by
the Director or executive officer in a non-compensatory transaction. For more information on hedging, please see Citi’s Hedging
Policies on pages 40–41. The following table shows the beneficial ownership
of Citi common stock by our Directors, named executive officers, and Directors and executive officers as a group at March 4, 2024. For
purposes of this table, “beneficial ownership” is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, pursuant

Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee considers all qualified candidates identified by members of the Nomination,
Governance and Public Affairs Committee, by other members of the Board, by senior management, and by security holders. During 2023,
the Committee engaged Spencer Stuart to assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees. Stockholders who would like to
propose a Director candidate for consideration by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee may do so by submitting
the candidate’s name, résumé, and biographical information to the attention of the Corporate Secretary, Citigroup
Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10013. All proposals for nominations received by the Corporate Secretary will be
presented to the Committee for its consideration. In considering the composition of the Board of Directors, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee inventories the categories
of risks faced by Citi, given its size, business mix, and geographical presence, and seeks to identify candidates with the skills and
experience necessary to enable the Board of Directors to provide proper oversight of those risks. The Nomination, Governance and Public
Affairs Committee also takes Director tenure into consideration when making Director nomination decisions and believes that it is desirable
to maintain a mix of longer-tenured, experienced Directors and newer Directors with fresh perspectives. The Nomination, Governance and
Public Affairs Committee and the Board also believe that longer-tenured, experienced Directors are a significant strength of the Board,
given the large size of our Company, the breadth of our product offerings, and the international scope of our organization. When nominating
new director candidates, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee instructs its recruiting firm to include diverse candidates
in each slate. The Board’s composition, and the individuals nominated for consideration by stockholders, are the result of careful
consideration by the Committee of the correspondence between the risk inventory and skills and experience of the Board members and candidates.
In addition to the ability to assist the Board in its oversight of a particular risk or risks, as more fully described in each nominee’s
biography, the members of the Board are assessed based on a variety of factors, including the following criteria, which have been developed
by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and approved by the Board: ● Whether the candidate has exhibited behavior that indicates he or she is committed to the highest ethical standards; ● Whether the candidate has had business, governmental, non-profit or professional experience at the chair, chief executive officer, chief
operating officer, or equivalent policy-making and operational level of a large organization with significant international activities
across many regulatory jurisdictions and regions that indicates that the candidate will be able to make a meaningful and immediate contribution
to the Board’s discussion of and decision-making on the array of complex issues facing a large financial services business that
operates on a global scale; ● Whether the candidate has special skills, expertise and a diverse background that would complement the attributes of the existing Directors,
taking into consideration the diverse communities and geographies in which the Company operates; ● Whether the candidate has the financial expertise required to provide effective oversight of a diversified financial services business
that operates on a global scale; ● Whether the candidate has achieved prominence in his or her business, governmental, or professional activities and has built a reputation
that demonstrates the ability to make the kind of important and sensitive judgments that the Board is called upon to make; Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 1: Election of Directors 47 ● Whether the candidate will effectively, consistently, and appropriately take into account and balance the legitimate interests and concerns
of all of the Company’s stockholders and other stakeholders in reaching decisions, rather than advancing the interests of a particular
constituency; ● Whether the candidate possesses a willingness to challenge management while working constructively as part of a team in an environment
of collegiality and trust; and ● Whether the candidate will be able to devote sufficient time and energy to the performance of his or her duties as a Director. Application
of these factors involves the exercise of judgment by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and the Board. In addition,
see Board Diversity on page  29 for additional factors considered by the Board when selecting candidates. Based
on its assessment of each candidate’s independence, skills and qualifications and the criteria described above, the Nomination, Governance
and Public Affairs Committee will make recommendations regarding potential Director candidates to the Board. The
Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee follows the same process and uses the same criteria for evaluating candidates proposed
by stockholders, members of the Board of Directors, and members of senior management. For the 2024 Annual Meeting, Citi did not receive
notice from any stockholders regarding a nomination to the Board of Directors. Director
Qualifications The
nominees for the Board of Directors each have the qualifications and experience to approve and guide Citi’s strategy and to oversee management’s execution of that strategic vision. Citi’s Board of Directors consists of individuals with the skills, experience, and diverse backgrounds
necessary to oversee Citi’s efforts toward becoming a simpler, smaller, safer, and stronger financial institution, while mitigating risk
and operating within a complex financial and regulatory environment. The
nominees listed below are leaders in business, the financial community, and academia because of their intellectual acumen and analytical
skills, strategic vision, ability to lead and inspire others to work with them, and records of outstanding accomplishments over a period
of decades. Each has been chosen to stand for election in part because of his or her ability and willingness to ask difficult questions,
understand Citi’s unique challenges, and evaluate the strategies proposed by management, as well as their implementation. Each
of the nominees has a long record of professional integrity, a dedication to his or her profession and community, a strong work ethic
that includes a commitment to coming fully prepared to meetings and being willing to spend the time and effort needed to fulfill professional
obligations and the ability to maintain a collegial environment. Many
of our nominees are either current or former chief executive officers or chairs of other large international corporations or have experience
leading and operating large, complex academic or governmental departments. As such, they have a deep understanding of, and extensive
experience in, many of the areas that are outlined below as being of critical importance to Citi’s proper operation and success. For
the purposes of its analysis, the Board has determined that nominees who have served as a chief executive officer or a chair of a major
corporation or large, complex institution have extensive experience with strategic planning, financial statement preparation, compensation
determinations, regulatory compliance (if their businesses are or were regulated), corporate governance, public affairs, and legal matters. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 48 Proposal
1: Election of Directors In
evaluating the composition of the Board, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee seeks to find and retain individuals
who, in addition to having the qualifications set forth in Citi’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, have the skills, experience and abilities
necessary to meet Citi’s unique needs as a highly regulated financial services company with operations within the United States and more
than 100 countries around the globe. The Committee has determined it is critically important to Citi’s proper operation and success that
its Board has, in addition to the qualities described above, expertise and experience in the following areas: Citi’s Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee is responsible for determining the compensation of the CEO and approving
    the compensation of other executive officers of the Company and the Executive Management Team. In order to properly carry out its
    responsibilities with respect to compensation, Citi’s Board must include members who have experience evaluating the
    structure of compensation for senior executives. They must understand the various forms of compensation that can be utilized, the
    purpose of each type and how various elements of compensation can be used to motivate and reward executives and drive performance,
    while not encouraging imprudent risk-taking or simply having short-term goals. Citi
    aspires to the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical conduct: doing what we say, reporting results with accuracy
    and transparency, and maintaining compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations that govern the Company’s businesses. The Board
    is responsible for shaping corporate governance policies and practices, including adopting the corporate governance guidelines
    applicable to the Company and monitoring the Company’s compliance with governance policies and the guidelines. To carry
    out these responsibilities, the Board must include experienced leaders in the area of corporate governance who must be familiar with
    governance issues, the constituencies most interested in those issues, and the impact that governance policies have on the functioning
    of a company. Environmental
    and Sustainability matters are critical business issues, with ties to both risk and opportunity. Citi has been engaged in sustainability
    for over 20 years and views the environment, sustainability and transparency as important aspects of stockholder and broader stakeholder
    value. Citi communicates its sustainability and environmental efforts to stockholders, clients and other stakeholders,
    including its achievements in the areas of environmental sustainability, climate change, net zero, community investment
    and development, and human rights. Environmental and social issues have the potential to impede corporate plans and long-term performance,
    which is why it is necessary to have a sustainability-competent Board. Citi’s Board must include members with experience in the
    areas of climate change and finance, community development, corporate social responsibility and other issues to help Citi navigate
    these complex and quickly evolving issues and to assist management in evaluating Citi’s policies and programs. Citi’s internal controls over financial reporting are designed to ensure that Citi’s financial reporting and its financial statements
    are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. While the Board and its committees are not responsible
    for preparing our financial statements, they have oversight responsibility, including the selection of outside independent
    auditors, subject to stockholder ratification, and lead audit engagement partner. The Board must include members with direct
    or supervisory experience in the preparation of financial statements, as well as finance, audit, and accounting expertise. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal
1: Election of Directors 49 Citi
    is a global leader providing financial services through the following business lines: (1) Services, which includes both Treasury
    & Trade Solutions and Securities Services; (2) Banking, which includes Investment Banking and Corporate Lending; (3) Markets;
    (4) U.S. Personal Banking; (5) Wealth; and (6) Legacy Franchises. Citi looks to its Board members with extensive financial services
    experience to assist it in evaluating its business model and strategies for reaching and servicing its clients. As
    of December 31, 2023, Citi employs approximately 239,000 people in over 90 countries. Human capital management is a critical
    capability for Citi’s Board given the strategic importance of maintaining a skilled, motivated workforce. Citi’s Board
    must include Directors who understand key issues related to human capital including training, diversity, employee benefits,
    compensation programs, career trajectories, and U.S. and global labor issues. Having Directors with the appropriate expertise to
    review our succession strategy and leadership pipeline for key roles while taking into account Citi’s long-term corporate
    strategy is paramount to managing Citi’s resources–its employees. Citi seeks out Board members who have had experience
    overseeing and managing executive teams and a sizeable worldwide workforce, with an emphasis on development of human
    resources. As
    a company with a broad international reach, Citi’s Board values the perspectives of Directors with international business or governmental
    experience or expertise in global economics. Citi’s presence in markets outside the United States is an important competitive advantage
    for Citi, because it allows us to serve U.S. and foreign businesses and individual clients whose activities span the globe. Directors
    with international business experience can use the experience that they have developed through their own business dealings to assist
    Citi’s Board and management in understanding and successfully navigating the business, political, and regulatory environments in
    countries in which Citi does or seeks to do business. Directors with global economics expertise can help guide Citi management in
    understanding the challenges faced by other markets and in developing its global strategy. Citi
    and its subsidiaries are regulated and supervised by numerous regulatory agencies, both domestically and internationally, including
    in the U.S. the FRB, the OCC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and state banking
    and insurance departments, as well as international financial services authorities. Having Directors with experience interacting
    with regulators or operating businesses subject to extensive regulation is important to furthering Citi’s continued compliance with
    its many regulatory requirements and fostering productive relationships with its regulators. Given the critical importance of ethics,
    conduct and culture, Citi’s Board must include members with experience overseeing ethics and compliance and building an effective,
    values-based ethics and compliance program. In addition to the regulatory supervision described above, Citi is subject to myriad
    laws and regulations and is party to legal actions and regulatory proceedings from time to time. Citi’s Board has an important oversight
    function with respect to compliance with applicable requirements, which includes monitoring the progress of legal proceedings and
    evaluating major settlements. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 50 Proposal
1: Election of Directors Risk
    management is a critical function of a complex global financial services company and its proper supervision requires Board members
    with sophisticated risk management skills and experience. Directors provide oversight of the Company’s risk management framework,
    including the significant policies, procedures, and practices used in managing credit, market (trading and non-trading), liquidity,
    strategic, operational, compliance, reputation and certain other risks, and review recommendations by management regarding risk mitigation.
    Citi’s Board must include members with risk expertise to assist Citi in its efforts to properly identify, measure, monitor, report,
    analyze, and control or mitigate risk. Citi
    has a long history as a technology innovator–Citibank, N.A. was one of the first banks to offer automatic teller machines for its
    customers during the 1970s. As Citi deploys new technology and platform innovations to gather, process, analyze, and provide information
    to execute transactions and meet the needs of its clients and customers, Citi must ensure that its operations are efficient and there
    is a continuous focus on enhancing productivity to meet its operational and strategic goals, while mitigating technology risks through
    efforts to improve cybersecurity, data privacy, and data management efforts. The Board must include members who have knowledge and
    experience in technology, including such technology-centric issues as cybersecurity, Generative AI, data privacy and data management. Members of
    the Board must be qualified to provide oversight of the development and maintenance of Citi’s technology platforms; Citi’s compliance
    with regulatory requirements; Citi’s operational efficiency and productivity strategies; the operations and reliability of Citi’s
    systems; and the protection of client and customer data. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal

Compensation The key objectives of our Director Compensation Program are to attract qualified talent, provide pay that is commensurate with the substantial
time commitment associated with service, and foster commonality of interest between Board members and our stockholders. Directors’ compensation is determined by the Board, and the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee makes recommendations
to the Board based on periodic benchmarking assessments and advice received from FW Cook, its independent advisor. In making recommendations
to the Board, the Committee considers the competitive positioning of the aggregate and individual components of compensation, as well
as the mix of pay and structure versus both direct competitors and other comparable organizations. The Committee also considers the unique
skill set required to serve on our Board and the intense time commitment associated with preparation for and attendance at meetings of
the Board and its committees as well as external commitments, such as engagement with our stockholders and regulators. Since our initial
public offering in 1986, Citi has paid outside Directors all or a portion of their compensation in common stock to ensure that the Directors
have an ownership interest in common with other stockholders. Annual
    Cash Retainer and Deferred Stock Award Non-employee Directors receive an annual cash retainer of $75,000 and a deferred stock award valued at $150,000. The deferred stock award
is generally granted in early January. In the event a Director retires or resigns from the Board in the year for which an award is granted
before attaining age 72, a pro rata portion of the award is forfeited, based on the number of full or partial calendar quarters served.
The deferred stock award generally becomes distributable on the first anniversary of the date of the grant, and Directors may elect to
defer receipt of the award beyond that date. Fees
    for Service on Citi’s Board Committees, Citibank’s Board, and other Board Service ● A Citi Director who serves as Chair of the Audit Committee, Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee, Risk Management
Committee, Technology Committee, or certain ad hoc committees is entitled to an annual $50,000 Committee Chair Fee per committee. A Director
who serves as Chair of any other Committee or certain ad hoc committees is entitled to an annual $35,000 Committee Chair Fee per committee.
A Citi Director who serves as a member of the Audit Committee, Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee, Risk Management
Committee, Technology Committee, or certain ad hoc committees is entitled to an annual $30,000 Committee Fee per committee. A Citi Director
who serves as a member of the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee or certain ad hoc committees is entitled to an annual
$15,000 Committee Fee per committee. Directors also receive compensation for their service on the Transformation Oversight Committee.
The Transformation Oversight Committee is an ad hoc committee. The Chair of the Transformation Oversight Committee is entitled to an annual
$50,000 Committee Chair Fee, and each member is entitled to an annual $30,000 Committee Fee. In addition, each Program Lead Director for
the Transformation Oversight Committee receives an additional fee of $20,000. Directors are permitted to receive all or a part of their
Committee Fee(s) and Committee Chair Fee(s) in common stock. ● Mses. Dailey, Desoer, Fraser, Ireland, and Taylor and Messrs. Hennes and Turley serve on Citibank’s Board of Directors. Each non-employee
Director of Citibank is entitled to receive $25,000 as an annual cash retainer. The Chair of Citibank’s Board is entitled to an
annual $50,000 Chair Fee. ● Citi reimburses its Board members for expenses incurred in attending Board and Committee meetings or performing other services for Citi
in their capacities as Directors. Such expenses include food, lodging, and transportation. ● All Annual Retainers, Committee Fees, and Committee Chair Fees for Citi and Citibank are paid in four equal quarterly installments per
annum. These fees are reported in the Non-Employee Director Compensation table on pages 66–67. ● Mr. von Koskull joined the Board of Citigroup Global Markets Limited (CGML), an international subsidiary Board of Citi, on June 2, 2023.
Mr. Henry served on the Board of CGML until December 2023. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 65 Chair Compensation Since Mr. Dugan’s initial appointment as Citi’s Chair in 2019, his annual total compensation from Citi has been $725,000.
The Board believes this amount is appropriate in light of the virtually full-time nature of the Chair’s responsibilities, Mr. Dugan’s
extensive experience and knowledge of the regulatory environment, and the compensation paid for similar roles among direct competitors,
including U.S. and non-U.S. banks as well as other high-profile global organizations. Since October of 2020, Mr. Dugan has also played
an active and important role in connection with Citi’s Transformation Program, including chairing the Transformation Oversight Committee,
as Citi seeks to drive excellence in its risk and control environment, operations, and service to clients. The components of Mr. Dugan’s compensation
    include a Chair Fee of $500,000 plus fees that all directors receive, which include the Retainer and Deferred Stock Award that total
    $225,000, as described above. These amounts remain unchanged from the amounts approved prior to Mr. Dugan’s appointment as
    Chair. While Mr. Dugan actively serves as the Chair and participates in three other Board Committees of which he is a
    member–Audit; Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs; and Risk Management–participates in ad hoc committees of which
    he is a member, and attends meetings of Board Committees of which he is not a member, Mr. Dugan waives all Committee Fees to which
    he is entitled. What We Do What We Don’t Do ✓ Citi’s
    Director Compensation Program is primarily equity based. ✓ Directors
    have a robust Stock Ownership Commitment. ✓ The
    maximum number of shares subject to awards to an individual Director in a calendar year, taken together with any cash fees paid during
    the calendar year to the Director for services as a member of the Board, may not exceed $1 million in value. While the Board may approve
    a higher limit for the non-Executive Chair, as noted above, amounts actually paid to the Chair are substantially below the $1 million cap. û Directors
    who are employees of Citi or its subsidiaries do not receive any compensation for their services as Directors. û Directors
    are not paid Meeting Fees. û Citi
    does not offer a Retirement Program for its Directors. û Directors
    are not permitted to hedge or pledge their Citi common stock or engage in speculative trading in Citi’s common stock. For more information
    on hedging, please see Citi’s Hedging Policies on

    W. von Koskull 3,314 www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 68 Audit Committee Report The Audit Committee (Committee) operates under a charter
that specifies the scope of the Committee’s responsibilities and how it carries out those responsibilities. The Board of Directors has determined that all six members
of the Committee are independent based upon the standards adopted by the Board, which incorporate the independence requirements under
applicable laws, rules and regulations. Management is responsible for the
financial reporting process, the system of internal controls, including internal control over financial reporting, risk management
and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. KPMG LLP,
Citigroup’s independent registered public accounting firm (independent auditors) is responsible for the integrated audit of
the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Committee’s responsibility is to
monitor and oversee these processes and procedures. The members of the Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of
accounting or auditing and are not professionals in these fields. The Committee relies, without independent verification, on the
information provided to it and on the representations made by management regarding the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and that such financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
Committee also relies on the opinions of the independent auditors of the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. The Committee’s meetings facilitate communication among
the members of the Committee, management, the internal auditors, and Citigroup’s independent auditors. The Committee separately
met with each of the internal and independent auditors with and without management, to discuss the results of their examinations and their
observations and recommendations regarding Citigroup’s internal controls. The Committee discussed with the independent auditors
the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB. The Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated
financial statements of Citigroup as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 with management, the internal auditors, and Citigroup’s
independent auditors. The Committee has received the written disclosures required
by PCAOB Rule 3526, “Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence.” The Committee discussed with the independent
auditors any relationships that may have an impact on their objectivity and independence and satisfied itself as to the auditors’
independence. The Committee has reviewed and
approved the amount of fees paid to the independent auditors for audit, audit-related and tax compliance, and other services. The
Committee concluded that the provision of services by the independent auditors did not impair their independence. Based on the above-mentioned review and discussions, and
subject to the limitations on our role and responsibilities described above and in the Committee charter, the Committee recommended to
the Board that Citigroup’s audited consolidated financial statements be included in Citigroup’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee: James S. Turley (Chair) Ellen M. Costello Grace E. Dailey John C. Dugan Duncan P. Hennes Renée J.

KPMG LLP (KPMG) as the independent registered public accounting firm of Citi for 2024. KPMG has served as the independent registered
public accounting firm of Citi and its predecessors since 1969. Arrangements have been made for representatives of KPMG to
attend the 2024 Annual Meeting. The representatives will have the opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and will be
available to respond to appropriate stockholder questions. Disclosure
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees The following is a description of the fees earned by KPMG
for services rendered to Citi for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023: 2023 2022 (in
    millions of dollars) Audit
    Fees $82.4 $77.7 Audit-Related
    Fees $21.7 $20.0 Tax
    Fees $5.9 $5.2 All
    Other Fees $0.0 $0.0 Total
    Fees $110.0 $102.9 Audit Fees This includes fees earned by KPMG in connection with the
annual integrated audits of Citi’s consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley
Section 404, audits of subsidiary financial statements, comfort letters and consents related to SEC registration statements, and other
capital-raising activities and certain reports relating to Citi’s regulatory filings, reports on internal control reviews required
by regulators, evaluation of accounting for completed transactions, and reviews of Citi’s interim financial statements. Audit-Related Fees This includes fees for services performed by KPMG that are
closely related to audits and in many cases could only be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. Such services
may include accounting consultations, internal control reviews not required by regulators, securitization-related services, employee benefit
plan audits, certain attestation services as well as certain agreed upon procedures, and due diligence services related to contemplated
mergers and acquisitions. Tax Fees This includes preparation and review of corporate tax returns,
expense allocation reports for tax purposes, and other tax compliance services. All Other Fees There were no services provided under this fee category in
2022 and 2023. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 70 Proposal 2: Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Approval of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Services and Fees Citi’s Audit Committee has
reviewed and approved all fees earned in 2022 and 2023 by Citi’s independent registered public accounting firm and actively
monitored the relationship between audit and non-audit services provided. The Audit Committee has concluded that the fees earned by
KPMG were consistent with the maintenance of the external auditors’ independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. The Audit Committee must pre-approve all services provided
and fees earned by Citi’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee annually considers the provision of
audit services and, if appropriate, pre-approves certain defined audit fees, audit-related fees, and tax-compliance fees with specific
dollar-value limits for each category of service. The Audit Committee also considers on a case-by-case basis specific engagements that
are not otherwise pre-approved (e.g., internal control and certain tax compliance engagements) or that exceed pre-approved fee amounts.
On an interim basis, any proposed engagement that does not fit within the definition of a pre-approved service may be presented to the
Chair of the Audit Committee for approval and to the full Audit Committee at its next regular meeting. The Accounting Firm Engagement Procedure is the primary basis
upon which management ensures the independence of its independent registered public accounting firm. Administration of the Procedure is
centralized in, and monitored by, Citi senior corporate financial management, which reports the engagements earned by KPMG throughout
the year to the Audit Committee. The Procedure also includes limitations on the hiring of KPMG partners and other professionals to ensure
that Citi satisfies applicable auditor independence rules. KPMG has served as the independent registered public accounting
firm of Citi and its predecessors since 1969. As in prior years, Citi and its Audit Committee have engaged in a review of KPMG in connection
with the Audit Committee’s consideration of whether to recommend that stockholders ratify the selection of KPMG as Citi’s
independent auditor for the following year. In that review, the Audit Committee considers both the continued independence of KPMG and
whether retaining KPMG is in the best interests of Citi and its stockholders. Citi’s management prepares an annual assessment of
KPMG for the Audit Committee that includes (i) the results of a management survey of KPMG’s overall performance; (ii) review of
external data on audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on KPMG and its peer firms; (iii) an analysis of KPMG’s
known legal risks and significant proceedings that may impair KPMG’s ability to perform Citi’s annual audit; and (iv) KPMG’s
fees and services provided to Citi both on an absolute basis, noting, of course, that KPMG does not provide any non-audit services, other
than those described in the Proxy Statement, to Citi, and compared to services provided by other auditing firms to peer institutions.
In addition, KPMG reviews with the Audit Committee its analysis of its independence in accordance with the Accounting Firm Engagement
Procedure and PCAOB Rule 3526. In performing its analysis, the Audit Committee considered the length of time KPMG has been Citi’s
independent auditor, the breadth and complexity of Citi’s business and its global footprint and the resulting demands placed on
its auditing firm in terms of expertise in Citi’s businesses, the quantity and quality of staff, and global reach. The Audit Committee
recognized the ability of KPMG to provide both the necessary expertise to audit Citi’s business and the matching global footprint
to audit Citi worldwide and other factors, including the policies that KPMG follows with respect to rotation of the key audit personnel,
so that there is a new partner-in-charge at least every five years. Citi’s Audit Committee oversees the process for, and ultimately
approves, the selection of the independent auditor’s lead engagement partner at the five-year mandatory rotation period. At the
Audit Committee’s instruction, KPMG selects candidates to be considered for the lead engagement partner role, who are then interviewed
by members of Citi’s senior management. After considering the candidates recommended by KPMG, senior management makes a recommendation
to the Audit Committee regarding the new lead engagement partner. After discussing the qualifications of the proposed lead engagement
partner with the current lead engagement partner and senior leadership of KPMG, the members of the Audit Committee, individually and/or as a group, interview the leading candidate. The Audit Committee then considers the appointment and votes as an Audit Committee on
the selection. Based on the results of its review this year, the Audit Committee concluded that KPMG is independent and that it is in
the best interests of Citi and its investors to appoint KPMG to serve as Citi’s independent registered accounting firm for 2024. Board
                                            Recommendation The
    Board recommends a vote FOR ratification of KPMG as Citi’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2024. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents 71 Proposal

Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 73 Organizational Changes During Ms. Fraser’s Tenure Ms. Fraser’s tenure as CEO
commenced on February 26, 2021, making 2023 her second full year as CEO. 2020 CONSENT ORDERS AND 2021 TRANSFORMATION ORGANIZATION BUILD Given the leadership role we play in the global financial
system, our regulators hold us to appropriately high standards. The Consent Orders we signed with the Federal Reserve Board and the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2020 are evidence that for some time our performance in this area fell short. We launched our Transformation
initiative in 2020 to make real and sustainable changes to strengthen our risk and control environment and modernize our operating model. While every member of our leadership team is involved in
the Transformation and plays a key, hands-on role in its implementation, Ms. Fraser has taken a leading role in managing the effort. She
has assembled an extraordinary team of top talent, consisting of long-tenured colleagues and new hires as appropriate, from across multiple
disciplines and areas of expertise and experience, with representatives from the businesses and global functions, to lead seven different
Transformation programs, including one added in 2023. Ms. Fraser is putting our best talent into this effort and has a detailed, integrated approach
to address the needs of our clients, investors and regulators. Ms. Fraser has built an
organization and infrastructure to manage, guide and support our Transformation. The organizational structure spans all Citi
businesses and functions to ensure consistency. Initially, the structure provided the tools to achieve that objective through our
Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) as well as various global forums and committees. Following our CAO’s retirement in 2023,
Ms. Fraser appointed our new Chief Operating Officer (COO), who reports to Ms. Fraser and is responsible for running Citi’s
Transformation program, as well as leading our work to improve operating efficiency and returns and leading our enterprise-wide
effort to strengthen the firm’s risk and controls and data, and modernize infrastructure while simplifying the firm. 2022 STRATEGIC REFRESH One of our major goals for 2022 and 2023 was to put in place a strategic plan designed to create long-term value for our stockholders
and to get that plan swiftly off the ground. We have made significant progress toward that end. Of the 14 consumer divestitures we announced, we have completed sales of nine of our consumer franchises, including Australia, Bahrain,
India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, with four of those sales completed in 2023. In May 2023, we
announced plans to pursue an IPO of our consumer, small business and middle-market operations in Mexico, and have since made significant
progress on the separation of the IPO business from the institutional business which is expected in the second half of 2024. We continued
to progress with the wind down of our consumer operations in Korea and China, and consumer, local commercial and institutional businesses
in Russia – including through portfolio sales – and restarted the sales process of our consumer business in Poland. We also made meaningful progress on our culture refresh beginning with the launch of Citi’s New Way in 2022. This is a three-year
research-based program that will integrate small but meaningful behavioral habits to drive execution excellence within the firm. Additional
information concerning our cultural transformation is on page 82. 2023 ORGANIZATIONAL SIMPLIFICATION In September 2023, Ms. Fraser announced significant changes to Citi’s organizational model to align our structure
with our strategy, which is centered around five core, interconnected businesses. This critical work will simplify Citi,
advance our Transformation and ensure that our clients are at the center of all we do. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 74 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation This new organizational model is
part of the work under way at Citi to execute the vision and strategy we presented at our 2022 Investor Day and to deliver on our
medium-term targets. Our vision is to be the preeminent banking partner for institutions with cross-border needs, a global leader in
wealth management and a valued personal bank in our home market. As a result of these changes, the leaders of Citi’s five interconnected businesses now report directly to Ms. Fraser
giving them greater accountability for delivering results. Delivery of Citi’s global network will be enhanced through
a streamlined geographic and business management structure and a centralized Client organization will help
strengthen how we deliver for clients across the firm. The new, flatter operating model eliminates management layers and regional management structures. This will
make Citi a simpler firm that can operate faster, better serve our clients and unlock value for our stockholders. At the same time, eliminating activities that detract from our competitiveness or add unnecessary complexity will
make us more agile in assessing risk and driving increased accountability across the firm. A lighter management structure for our international franchises will create a stronger, more consistent enterprise-wide
approach to how we deliver for our core client base of multinational institutions. Through our new, centralized Client organization we can take a comprehensive view of our relationships, client
strategy and client coverage model across our businesses. This will ensure we continue to break down silos and
focus on firm-wide performance and outcomes. Additional information concerning our new, centralized Client
organization is on page 81. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 75 2023 NEO Compensation Rationale OUR
    STRATEGIC PRIORITIES The following describes the principal considerations shaping
the overall perspective of the Compensation Committee concerning 2023 pay decisions. Our major goal for 2023 was to
execute on our strategic plan of simplifying the firm by focusing on five core interconnected businesses designed to create
long-term value for our stockholders. Notwithstanding challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, under Ms.
Fraser’s leadership, Citi made solid progress on this restructuring priority during 2023 by: ● Having leaders of Citi’s five interconnected
                                                                                                                       businesses - Services, Markets, Banking, Wealth and U.S. Personal Banking - report directly to the CEO. ● Revising our financial reporting structure with management
reporting for each business to enable investors and others to better understand the performance and value of our businesses. ● Investing in our Wealth business. ● Establishing a new Client organization to strengthen client
delivery across all lines of business. ● Eliminating managerial layers to reduce bureaucracy and provide
decision-makers with more autonomy. ● Eliminating our regional structure to deliver Citi’s
global network enhanced through a streamlined geographic structure. ● Completing the majority of our planned divestitures and wind down of 14 international
consumer franchises. ● Strengthening our culture of enhanced accountability, excellence,
and stockholder alignment across Citi. CEO COMPENSATION The Compensation Committee increased Ms. Fraser’s total
compensation from $24.5 million in 2022 to $26 million in 2023 because it concluded that Ms. Fraser’s leadership in furtherance
of the achievement of the strategic objectives described above was exemplary. In making its decision, the Compensation
Committee also took into account the competitive market rate of pay among our core peers, Citi’s operational performance as described
throughout this Proxy Statement, as well as Citi’s absolute and relative total stockholder returns during 2023, including the various
elements of Citi’s executive compensation program that tie compensation to total stockholder return. In assessing the impact of
our financial performance in the fourth quarter on Ms. Fraser’s pay outcome, the Compensation Committee considered that the fourth
quarter financial performance was largely driven by circumstances outside of her control, namely expenses associated with the FDIC special
assessment, a reserve build associated with transfer risk in Russia and Argentina, the pre-tax revenue impact from the devaluation of
the Argentine peso and a restructuring charge related to actions taken as part of Citi’s organizational simplification. In order to align Ms.
Fraser’s compensation with stockholder interests, the Compensation Committee determined that the components of her 2023
incentive compensation would, as in 2022, continue to be weighted toward stock-based compensation. Ms. Fraser’s compensation
is aligned with stockholder interests through various features of our compensation program that tie the amount of compensation to
our stock price and financial metrics. The disclosure on page 111 concerning pay versus performance, as required by SEC disclosure
rules, provides additional information concerning that alignment. The stockholder alignment of our compensation program is
illustrated by the fact, as described on page 111, that while Ms. Fraser’s total compensation as reflected in the Summary
Compensation Table on page 104 was approximately $26 million in 2023, the amount actually paid to Ms. Fraser, determined pursuant to
the SEC’s pay versus performance disclosure rules, was approximately $20.7 million. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 76 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation TRANSFORMATION BONUS PROGRAM To incentivize effective execution in connection with the
Consent Order programs and to drive change in Citi’s risk and control environment and culture, in August 2021 the Compensation Committee
approved the Transformation Bonus Program. A description of the Transformation Bonus Program was included in our 2022 Proxy Statement.
Additional information related to the Transformation Bonus Program can be found in the supplemental solicitation materials Citi filed
with the SEC in 2022, which can be accessed at www.citigroup.com. Ms. Fraser is not eligible to participate in the Transformation Bonus
Program. All other members of our EMT at the time the Transformation Bonus Program was adopted, as well as approximately 250 other employees who were deemed
to be critical to execution in connection with the Consent Order programs, were eligible to participate in the Transformation Bonus Program. Every member of our leadership team is involved in the Transformation
and plays a key, hands-on role in its implementation. We have assembled an extraordinary team of top talent, consisting of long-tenured
colleagues and new hires as appropriate, from across multiple backgrounds and perspectives, and areas of expertise and experience, with representatives
from the businesses and global functions, to lead seven different Transformation programs, including one added in 2023. We are putting our best talent into this effort and have a detailed, integrated approach to address
the needs of our clients, investors and regulators. Following the completion of the
first performance measurement period under the Transformation Bonus Program, the Compensation Committee determined that the
Performance Achievement Percentage for the period ending on December 31, 2022 would be 94%. Following completion of the second measurement period, the
Compensation Committee determined that the Performance Achievement Percentage for the period ending on December 31, 2023 would be 80%. Citi provides both
regulators on an ongoing basis information regarding its plans and progress and continues to work constructively with both
regulators to reflect their feedback on remediation efforts. The terms and conditions of the Transformation
Bonus Program were not changed for 2023. In approving the Transformation Bonus Program, the Compensation Committee did not intend
that it would be a replacement, substitution or make-up for any other compensation amount, nor does the Compensation Committee
expect to make other special awards related to the Transformation in the future. For further information concerning the
Transformation Bonus Program see pages 82 and 94 to 95. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Since 2013, Citi has delivered a portion of incentive compensation for our EMT in the form of PSUs. For 2023,
we expanded the use of PSUs in our compensation program by extending the use of PSUs to EMT members resident in the UK. In addition, our
EMT was enlarged from 16 to 19 executives. As described more fully on page
93 below, the Compensation Committee determined that 100% of the target number of shares subject to PSUs granted as part of our 2020
incentive compensation awards were earned for the three-year performance period from 2021 through 2023. This determination reflected
the capping of above-target financial metric performance because of negative total stockholder return during such period. The
resulting payout value was equal to 93% of initial value, including the impact of both financial performance and total stockholder
return during the three-year performance period from 2021 through 2023, as compared to a zero payout for the prior period. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 77 Our Compensation Philosophy Our Compensation Philosophy is designed to encourage prudent
risk-taking and management of controls while attracting the world-class talent necessary for our success. Our Compensation Philosophy
is summarized by the following five objectives: ● Reinforce a business culture based on the highest ethical
standards ● Manage our risks by encouraging prudent decision-making ● Reflect regulatory guidance in compensation programs ● Attract and retain the best talent to lead us to success ● Align compensation programs, structures, and decisions with
stockholder and other stakeholder interests The full statement of our Compensation Philosophy is available
on our public website at www.citigroup.com. Consistent with our Compensation Philosophy, we design our
executive pay program to motivate balanced behaviors. The compensation of our executive officers is determined based on a disciplined
policy of goal setting and measurement and assessment of performance against pre-established goals. Transparency, discipline and performance
feedback are key factors in our approach to executive officer compensation. Implementation of the process spans the full year. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 78 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 2023 Citi Performance The following summarizes highlights of Company performance
in 2023 in respect of our four performance pillars: ● Financial ● Risk and Control ● Leadership ● Client and Franchise Discussion of the performance of
each of the NEOs individually (other than Mr. Sieg, whose incentive compensation was guaranteed for 2023) in respect of each
performance pillar is on pages 83 to 89. Financial Pillar The following financial performance highlights were considered
by the Compensation Committee when awarding executive incentive compensation for 2023. In making compensation determinations, our Compensation
Committee takes into account additional financial metrics for each individual named executive officer, as described below on pages 83 to 89. 2023 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS For the one-, three- and five-year periods ending with 2023
our total stockholder returns have been 18.9%, (6.4%) and 18.6%, respectively. Our 2023 financial performance highlights included: ● Citi’s revenues increased 4% versus the prior year.
Excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues also increased 4%. ● Citi’s expenses increased 10% versus the prior year,
including divestiture-related impacts in both the current and prior years. Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, expenses increased
11%. ● Citi’s cost of credit was $9.2 billion, versus $5.2
billion in the prior year. ● Citi returned $6.1 billion to common stockholders in the form
of dividends and share repurchases. ● Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach, increased
to 13.4% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 13.0% as of December 31, 2022 (for additional information, see “Capital Resources”
in Citi’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K). This compares to Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3% as of October 1, 2023,
under the Basel III Standardized Approach. ● Citi made substantial progress on its consumer banking business
divestitures in 2023 and through March of 2024, closing sales in 4 exit markets, as well as progressing with the ongoing wind downs of
the Korea and China consumer banking business and Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional businesses, and the planned
initial public offering of Citi’s consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico, and restarting
the sales process for its Poland consumer banking business. As used throughout this Proxy Statement,
Citi’s revenues and expenses excluding divestiture-related impacts, Tangible Book Value per Share and Return on Tangible Common
Equity are each non-GAAP financial measures. See Annex A for a reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to their corresponding GAAP
financial measures. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 79 The following graphs illustrate our achievements in respect
of certain additional key financial metrics during 2023. RETURN ON ASSETS REVENUE GROWTH DILUTED EPS TOTAL PAYOUT RATIO BOOK VALUE PER SHARE TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER SHARE Risk and Control Management Pillar The following risk and control management performance highlights
were considered by the Compensation Committee when awarding executive incentive pay for 2023. In making compensation determinations, our
Compensation Committee takes into account additional risk and control metrics for each individual named executive officer, as described
below on pages 83 to 89. ANNUAL INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS Our compensation programs are designed in accordance with
our responsibility to assume only risks that are prudent and to effectively manage those risks to protect the franchise. Our programs
reinforce and are aligned with our risk governance framework. Our Compensation Philosophy requires us to consider risk
management when making discretionary incentive compensation awards. We adjust the amount of compensation upwards to recognize exemplary
behaviors and downwards to disincentivize employees from taking inappropriate risks. Our incentive compensation awards have the following important
elements: ● Our executive compensation framework takes risk and control
management into account in several ways, including: ● using financial metrics that reflect risk as an element of
each executive’s financial goals ● evaluating risk management performance, including effectiveness
of the control environment, as part of the performance assessment ● providing for forfeiture of the deferred portion of incentive
awards based on adverse risk outcomes ● We systematically identify employees who, individually
or as part of a group, have authority or responsibilities that may subject the firm to material risks. Through a systematic annual
process, we identify the material risks to the firm and then identify employees with influence over those risks. We refer to those employees
as “covered employees.” The compensation structure for covered employees, including the NEOs, includes
substantial deferrals and clawbacks intended to cover a range of behaviors. The portion of incentive awards that are subject to deferral
increases with the size of incentive awards. ● Our executive compensation governance process ensures that
risk and control performance is taken into account in evaluating performance for covered employees. Under our process, covered employees
can receive adjustments to their incentive awards in amounts ranging from negative 100% to positive 25% of total compensation to reflect
their performance assessment for the Risk and Control Pillar. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 80 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation ● Regulatory matters are reflected in performance assessments

at least twice annually to the Compensation Committee on risk levels and trends across our businesses and on the design and operation
of our incentive compensation program. OUR TRANSFORMATION Given the leadership role we play in the global financial
system, our regulators hold us to appropriately high standards. The Consent Orders are evidence that our performance in this area fell
short for some time. We launched our Transformation initiative in 2020 to make real and sustainable changes to strengthen our risk and
control environment and modernize and simplify our firm to make Citi a better bank for our clients and a more productive place for our
colleagues to work. Our Transformation Steering Committee, chaired by our CEO,
sets the overall direction for our Transformation efforts, with oversight from our Board of Directors. In 2023, we placed leaders with
demonstrated success in leading transformative change in key roles to steer our Transformation. For example, we appointed a new Chief
Operating Officer to advance progress across the firm and engage Citi colleagues in the important role they have in driving our Transformation
and strengthening our culture. In 2023, we progressed our Transformation efforts into full
implementation mode. We continue to simplify and modernize the firm to better manage risk in many ways, including by consolidating technology
platforms, automating processes and reducing manual touch points, enhancing data quality and governance, and implementing a new model
for managing wholesale credit risk. Our organizational simplification efforts, discussed below,
will advance the execution of Citi’s Transformation, the firm’s top priority. While implementing our simplification strategy,
Citi remains focused on  transforming our risk management, controls and infrastructure so that we can operate at scale
and with speed to deliver client excellence. Leadership Pillar The primary Leadership highlights for Citi in 2023 arose
from the need to continue to execute on our strategic refresh. OUR ORGANIZATIONAL SIMPLIFICATION In September 2023, Citi announced significant changes to simplify our organizational model so that it is aligned with our strategy, advances
our Transformation and ensures that our clients are at the center of all we do. This new organizational model is
part of the work under way at Citi to execute the plan we presented at our 2022 Investor Day and deliver on our medium-term
targets. At Investor Day, we set a clear, compelling vision for the firm to be the preeminent banking partner for institutions with cross-border
needs, a global leader in wealth management and a valued personal bank in our home market. We have been
executing a strategy to bring this vision to life through our five interconnected businesses: ● Services – includes Treasury & Trade Solutions
and Securities Services ● Markets ● Banking – includes Investment Banking and Corporate Lending ● U.S. Personal Banking ● Wealth Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 81 The interconnectivity of these businesses will benefit our clients and support our strategic shift to a more balanced business mix that
delivers higher returns, fees, and growth over time. This increased focus on business services and the connectivity we now have across
our businesses that operate under a set of common standards, platforms, controls and processes for similar activities will also lead to
a reduction in risk over time. As a result of these changes, the leaders of Citi’s
five interconnected businesses now report directly to the CEO, delivery of Citi’s global network will be enhanced through a streamlined
geographic structure and a new, centralized Client organization will help strengthen how we deliver for clients. The new flatter operating model
elevated the leaders of Citi’s five businesses and eliminated the Institutional Clients Group and Personal Banking and Wealth
Management layers as well as the regional structures consisting of Citi Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America.
This will speed up decision-making and drive increased accountability. We are eliminating activities that detract from our competitiveness
or add unnecessary complexity. This will make us faster in responding to our clients’ needs and making decisions about the risks
we will take on and the financing we will provide. A lighter
management structure for our international franchises will also create a stronger, more consistent enterprise-wide approach to how
we deliver for our core client base of multinational institutions. Through our new, centralized Client organization we can take
a comprehensive view of our relationships, client strategy and client coverage model across our businesses to ensure we continue to break
down silos and focus on firm-wide performance and outcomes. Additional information concerning our new, centralized Client organization
is on page 81  below. We have also revised our financial reporting structure to
align with our strategy refresh and to enable investors and others to better understand the performance and value of our businesses. Client and Franchise Pillar The success of our client and franchise efforts depends on
a long-term, firmwide approach. Overall, we successfully navigated through the macro and geopolitical shocks that defined 2023 and supported
our clients and communities with excellence and compassion. NEW CLIENT ORGANIZATION This year, we highlight our creation of a centralized Client
organization to strengthen how we deliver for clients across the business. The creation of our Client organization most exemplifies our
firm’s heightened focus on clients. Ms. Fraser has tapped David Livingstone to lead the Client organization as Citi’s Chief
Client Officer. There is now clear accountability for addressing the needs of our clients and framing our strategy through that dimension. Mr. Livingstone and his team are taking a comprehensive view
of our client relationships, ensuring that we deliver one Citi in a consistent and disciplined way through a centralized view of our client
strategy, segmentation and coverage model, as well as our capital allocation. The new Client organization has been driven by the imperative
to improve both the experience that our clients have when using our products and services and also the returns that we deliver from our
activities. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 82 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION In 2022, Citi’s New Way
launched in support of an enterprise-wide cultural transformation at the firm. Citi’s New Way is a three-year, research-based
program that gradually introduces a series of small, simple daily habits to drive critical cultural improvements across the
organization. The goal of this effort is to embed the behaviors that Citi needs most to drive a culture of excellence and
accountability at the bank and alignment with our Leadership Principles. Our cultural transformation is taken into account in the
performance assessment under our Transformation Bonus Program. Additional information about our Transformation Bonus Program is on
pages 76 and 94 to 95. At the start of the program, specific habits were rolled
out to help drive greater clarity around ownership of projects, decisions and meeting discussions. These habits were introduced via 45-minute
workshops, open to all Citi colleagues, which explained how these habits can improve day-to-day collaboration. Results from this initial
rollout show that 60% of Citi colleagues use these ownership habits at least once a week. In 2023, the program’s focus turned to ‘productive
debate,’ designed to enable more timely, effective decision-making. Attendance at these workshops in 2023 was 13% higher than in
2022, and over 75% of participants indicated the habits they learned resulted in more informed decision-making and increased employee
willingness to raise risks and concerns during discussions. In addition to these internal results, the program received several prestigious
accolades from the Association of Business Psychology for operational excellence and innovation in 2023. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 83 2023 NEO Performance The foregoing

    PSU AWARD DESIGN The following summarizes the terms of PSUs awarded
by us in 2024 in respect of performance during 2023. The performance metrics approved from the 2023 PSUs are Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE) and Tangible Book Value Per Share (TBVPS),
and cover the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026. The RoTCE metric has been adjusted to maintain a relative comparison to
peers in order to protect against unusual macroeconomic environment events, but within a narrower range than in 2022 and to align more
closely to target payout based on our three-year plan, and to use a weighted average RoTCE across the three-year performance period. The
TBVPS grid has been increased to align with our three-year plan. AWARD

    RoTCE is a weighted average of annual RoTCE performance for 2024, 2025 and 2026, in the following proportion: 20%/30%/50%. The weighting
    gives greater import to RoTCE performance in the medium term than in the short term. Compared to 2022, the band within which RoTCE
    performance relative to peers determines the percent of target PSU earned has been narrowed. The 2022 band extended from 5% to 10%,
    whereas the 2023 band extends from 5% to 9%. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 92 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation AWARD
    FEATURE PERFORMANCE
    YEAR 2023 PSU DESCRIPTION Relative Weighted Average RoTCE performance is determined
    as follows: (i) zero to 100% PSUs earned for relative performance from the bottom to the 50 th percentile of the peer group,
    (ii) 100% to 150% PSUs earned for relative performance between the 50th and 75th percentile of the peer group and (iii) 150% PSUs earned
    for relative performance at or above the 75th percentile of the peer group. For this purpose, the peer group consists of Bank of America,
    Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Wells Fargo. For each metric, performance
    between fixed outcomes described above is determined by straight-line interpolation. Award Delivery After the end of the performance period, the number of earned PSUs will be multiplied by the average of our common stock price over the 20 trading days preceding the final vesting date, and the resulting value will be paid in cash, except for employees resident in the UK where deferrals for up to seven years are required by law. This practice links the payout to changes in the price of our common stock while limiting stockholder dilution. TSR Factor The number of PSUs that may be earned is capped at target if our total stockholder return is negative over the three-year performance period, regardless of the outcome of the performance metrics. Vesting Prior to 2023, PSUs were subject to pro-rata vesting. Beginning in 2023, PSUs are subject to three-year cliff vesting with a provision of early retirement upon satisfaction of the Rule of 60. Dividend Equivalents Dividend equivalents will be accrued and paid on the number of earned PSUs after the end of the performance period; dividend equivalents on PSUs that are not earned will be forfeited. Clawbacks PSUs are subject to clawbacks Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 93 PERFORMANCE
    SHARE UNIT PAYOUTS The chart below illustrates the components of the payout amounts for PSUs settled in 2022 through 2024, illustrating the relative impact of stock price change and operational performance metrics. 150% of PSUs awarded in 2021 and settled in 2024 were earned based on performance against operational financial metrics during the performance period, including equitable adjustments as required under the applicable award agreements for unusual and non-recurring items arising from the impacts of divestitures, restructuring and an FDIC special assessment (net $3.247 billion increase in earnings before taxes). The number of shares earned was capped at 100% of target because of negative total stockholder return during the applicable performance period. For PSUs awarded in 2020 and
settled in 2023, minimum threshold levels of performance against operational financial metrics were not achieved during the
performance period. As a result, none of those PSUs were earned. PSU

with the target outcome to change Citi’s business and operating models such that they simultaneously strengthen risk and controls
and improve Citi’s value to customers, clients and stockholders. The Transformation includes efforts to effectively implement the
Consent Orders. For additional information about the Consent Orders, see “Risk Factors–Compliance Risks” in Citi’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, and Citi’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on
October 7, 2020. Colleagues at all levels are expected to play an active
role in achieving these standards, and senior leaders are accountable for driving progress. To incentivize effective execution in connection
with the Consent Order programs and to drive change in Citi’s risk and control environment and culture, in August 2021 the Compensation
Committee approved the Transformation Bonus Program. A description of the Transformation Bonus Program was included in our 2022 Proxy
Statement. Additional information related to the Transformation Bonus Program can be found in the supplemental solicitation materials
filed by us in 2022 with the SEC, which can be accessed on our public website. Ms. Fraser is not eligible to participate in the Transformation
Bonus Program. All other members of our EMT at the time the Program was adopted, as well as approximately 250 other employees who are
deemed to be critical to execution in connection with the Consent Order programs, are eligible to participate in the Transformation Bonus
Program. Performance under our
Transformation Bonus Program is based on the collective achievement of metrics in various categories, rather than on individual
performance, in order to foster a unified, collective focus on achieving key Transformation goals and ensure consistent leadership
throughout the multi-year effort. Central to the design of the Transformation Bonus Program was the recognition that our ability to
achieve the objectives of our Transformation requires collective effort over a multi-year period. Accordingly, participants in the
Transformation Bonus Program are collectively evaluated against outcomes in order to foster a culture of shared accountability. Performance is measured, and the
bonus, if any, payable pursuant to the Transformation Bonus Program is paid in three tranches, each representing a separate
performance period. Specific goals and related metrics are established for each of the three tranches. The maximum portion of the
bonus payable for each tranche is: 25% for the first tranche, 25% for the second tranche and 50% for the third tranche. Shortly before each designated
payment date, an assessment is made by the Compensation Committee to determine what portion – if any – of the relevant
tranche is collectively earned based on performance relative to specific preset targets for the applicable performance period. The
portion to be paid out for each tranche will be applied to all participants in the Transformation Bonus Program on a consistent
basis. For example, while a maximum of 25% of the award can be earned for the first tranche, if the Compensation Committee
determines, based on the relevant criteria, that collective performance merits only a 15% payout, then each participant will
only be paid 15% for that tranche (assuming they satisfy all other conditions for entitlement to be paid). The first and second tranches are only impacted by
performance relative to preset targets. Each constitutes a maximum of 25% of the award. The third tranche, which constitutes a
maximum of 50% of the award, is affected by both performance relative to preset targets and stock performance. For this third tranche,
once performance is accounted for and the base payout is determined to be either the maximum 50% or some lower percentage as described
above, the payout is further adjusted based on stock performance. That is, the payout amount is further adjusted downward or upward as
if that payout had been invested in Citi common stock, from the date of grant of each award through the payment date for the third tranche,
taking into account stock price changes and the sum of dividends paid (without interest or assumed reinvestment), consistent with our
customary approach for equity-based compensation. The starting value for this calculation is $70.37, the average closing price of our
stock from October 25-29, 2021, the five-day period before awards were granted to participants. The ending value for this calculation
will be the five-day average of closing prices for the stock for the period ending on February 19, 2025, Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 95 the scheduled payment date for
the third tranche. Stock performance during this period is the only means by which the award value can be increased above the target award
value for the third tranche; the value of the award could also decrease if stock performance decreases. Participants must continue to be actively
employed by Citi at the payment date to receive a payment. Payments are further subject to all Transformation Bonus Program conditions,
including demonstrable leadership in all job specific aspects of the Transformation, a satisfactory Risk and Control Pillar performance
rating under our normal annual incentive assessment process, and the rules of our Accountability Framework. Payments are also subject
to cancellation and clawback provisions as described on page 99. There is no opportunity to make
up for reductions to earlier tranches through exceptional performance for later tranches. In approving the Transformation Bonus
Program, the Compensation Committee did not intend that it would be a replacement, substitution or make-up for any other
compensation amount, nor does the Compensation Committee expect to make other special awards related to the Transformation in the
future. The Citigroup and Citibank Boards of Directors each
formed a Transformation Oversight Committee, an ad hoc committee of each Board, to provide oversight of management’s remediation
efforts under the Consent Orders. The primary focus for the first part of our remediation efforts involved the development of comprehensive
plans to remediate our regulatory issues and submission of those plans to our regulators. The primary focus for the second part of our
remediation efforts involved execution on those plans. Tranche 2 Payout Determination The Compensation Committee
determined that the metric categories for the second tranche of the program, covering the calendar year 2023 performance period,
were: ● Execution of specific actions management must take during Phase 2 of our remediation plan ● Execution
quality , which is the percentage of milestones reviewed by Citi’s Internal Audit function that it deems to be complete ● Culture
change , which is based on a broad-based employee survey that is designed to measure cultural alignment with our Leadership Principles
as described on pages 80 and 81 Following the completion of the second performance
measurement period under the Transformation Bonus Program, the Compensation Committee determined that the Performance Achievement Percentage
for that period would be 80%, compared to 94% in 2022, reflecting the Compensation Committee’s assessment of performance relative
to the predetermined targets. The payout of Tranche 2 of the Transformation Bonus
Program reflected solid performance in respect of two groups of quantitative metrics (Execution and Quality of Execution) equal to approximately
80%, as well as the qualitative consideration of Culture, which is informed by the 2023 Voice of the Employee (VOE) Leadership Indices
and which contributed positively to the Compensation Committee’s determination. Tranche 3 Performance Metrics The Compensation Committee has
determined that the metric categories for the third tranche of the program, covering the calendar year 2023 performance period, will
be the same as the metric categories for Tranche 2: ● Execution of specific actions management must take during Phase 3 of our remediation plan ● Execution
quality, which is the percentage of milestones reviewed by Citi’s Internal Audit function that it deems to be complete ● Culture
change, which is based on a broad-based employee survey that is designed to measure cultural alignment with our Leadership Principles
as described on pages 80 and 81 The Compensation Committee set specific objective targets in respect of performance metrics within those categories early in 2024. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 96 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation Compensation Process and Governance Our Annual Compensation Process The following summarizes the principal elements of
our process for setting incentive compensation for our NEOs. We adopted our CART in 2020 as a means for administering
our new compensation principles and practices. CART is an integral part of our compensation framework that resulted in significantly increased
transparency and discipline with respect to the impact of risk and control performance on compensation decisions. CART’s most important
feature is that it requires managers to provide performance details across each of the four CART pillars – Risk and Control, Financial,
Client and Franchise, and Leadership – to support compensation decisions. CART creates a comprehensive record evidencing how
risk was considered in compensation decisions. This practice enables us to systematically hold each manager of an in-scope employee accountable
in a disciplined way for management of risk and controls and for determining compensation. Each named executive officer’s total incentive
award is based on a market benchmarking process, Citi’s overall achievements, and individual executive performance against applicable
goals. Target compensation is aligned through a market benchmarking process, with market rates of pay adjusted to reflect each named executive
officer’s experience and scope of role as the starting point for incentive pay. Each named executive officer’s performance
is evaluated against the four pillars and is informed by metrics contained in the executive’s scorecard. The Compensation Committee
then considers how performance in each pillar impacts the incentive compensation amount and written narrative assessments for each of
the four pillars are completed linking pay to performance. The Compensation Committee completes this assessment for our CEO and contributes
to the assessments for our other executive officers. Under our compensation framework, our Compensation
Committee uses a five-step process when making final determinations regarding named executive officer incentive compensation. The steps
are illustrated in the following graphic and summarized immediately below the graphic. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 97 Step 1 – Goal Setting
    for Scorecards ● The
    Compensation Committee approves scorecard goals for each named executive officer early in the annual compensation cycle. The goals fall
    into four performance pillars: Risk and Control, Financial, Client and Franchise, and Leadership. The type and number of goals for each
    pillar vary by named executive officer, based on the nature of his or her position: Ø Risk
    and Control goals include: ü Risk
    and control behavior assessment ü Risk
    limits and controls performance ü Anti-money
    laundering and other specific regulatory criteria ü Progress
    on regulatory remediation programs Ø Financial goals include: ü Company-wide
    goals for all NEOs that reflect our annual business plan ü Business
    unit-specific goals for NEOs who are business unit leaders that reflect annual plans for our individual business units Ø Client
    and Franchise goals include: ü Goals
    relating to metrics that are important to the strength of the franchise and, for executives who are business leaders, goals relating to
    growth in our client relationships ü Diversity and other human capital management goals Ø Leadership goals include: ü Leadership
    values, based on our Leadership Principles can be found at www.citigroup.com/global/about us Step 2 – Evaluation of
    Market Pay ● The
    Compensation Committee reviews prior year market pay to determine a market benchmark for each named executive officer role. Ranges are
    developed based on public information and third-party market surveys of compensation for the same or comparable roles at peer firms. This
    market benchmark is then adjusted based on the scope of the role at Citi and experience of the executive. ● This
    practice helps us set named executive officer pay at levels that reflect market rates based on tenure, experience, and the skill set of
    each executive. Step 3 – Performance
    Assessment ● At
    the end of each year, a named executive officer’s performance against each goal is assessed. A performance rating is assigned for
    each performance pillar. ● Each
    named executive officer is categorized into one of four risk classifications. ● The
    Compensation Committee rates the CEO’s performance, and the CEO and Compensation Committee rate the performance of the other NEOs. Step 4 – Linking Performance
    to Compensation ● The
    Compensation Committee then applies each named executive officer’s performance rating for each pillar against the prescribed compensation
    adjustment range to determine an appropriate compensation adjustment for each pillar. The net aggregate compensation adjustments are then
    applied to the adjusted market benchmark to determine a forecasted compensation amount. ● The
    Compensation Committee retains the authority to further adjust pay to reflect unusual performance outcomes that are not within the scope
    of the four pillars. ● The
    Compensation Committee further adjusts pay to reflect any required impacts under our Accountability Framework. Step 5 –
    Compensation Committee Determination ● The
    Compensation Committee approves performance ratings, and compensation adjustments. ● The
    Compensation Committee, exercising its fiduciary judgment, determines the final award amount for each named executive officer. Our Compensation Peer Group Our vision for Citi is to be the preeminent bank for
institutions with cross-border needs, a global leader in wealth, and a major player in consumer payments and lending in our home market. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 98 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation Because of our need to compete in
the market for talent while at the same time aligning compensation with performance, considering the compensation decisions and
performance achievements of peers is a key fact in Citi’s compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee considers named
executive officer compensation in the context of pay levels and performance at a 13-member peer group and a smaller core peer group
consisting of five U.S.-based global banks with lines of business and scale similar to ours. The Compensation Committee, with input from its independent
compensation consultant, established our compensation peer group. The Compensation Committee evaluates the compensation peer group on
an annual basis to ensure that the group continues to be appropriate. The Compensation Committee continues to believe that a U.S.-based
peer group reflects the relevant market for executive talent and the relevant regulatory environment for our executive compensation. We chose the peers because they operate
in one or more lines of business that are similar to ours and compete in similar labor markets. In selecting the compensation peer group,
the Compensation Committee uses size-based metrics as primary screening criteria among financial services firms. Citigroup’s size
relative to its full peer group is generally near or above the 75th percentile but is closer to median when compared to its core peers.
Citi’s business is relatively complex compared to peers because of the global scope and depth of its business. 2023
    COMPENSATION PEER GROUP AIG (AIG) Goldman Sachs (GS) Prudential (PRU) American Express (AXP) JPMorgan Chase (JPM) U.S. Bancorp (USB) Bank of America (BAC) MetLife (MET) Wells Fargo (WFC) BNY Mellon (BK) Morgan Stanley (MS) Capital One (COF) PNC (PNC) In evaluating the market for named executive officer
compensation, the Compensation Committee focuses primarily on compensation for comparable roles at the U.S.-based global banks with lines
of business and scale similar to ours: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo. The information
is compiled with the assistance of an outside third-party survey firm using a proprietary database. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 99 Clawback Provisions Incentives awarded to the NEOs
and other employees include multiple provisions permitting Citi to cancel or claw back the awards under a range of adverse outcomes. These
provisions did not significantly change in 2023. The following lists the principal triggers. POTENTIAL
    TRIGGER PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS Misconduct or materially imprudent judgment that caused harm to any of our business operations, or that resulted or could result in regulatory sanctions, including either failure to supervise employees who engaged in such behavior or failure to escalate such behavior. Significant responsibility for a Material Adverse Outcome (MAO). Award received based on materially inaccurate publicly reported financial statements. Employee knowingly engaged in providing materially inaccurate information relating to publicly reported financial statements. Material violation of any risk limits established or revised by senior management and/or risk management. Gross misconduct. Intentional misconduct or fraud that requires the restatement of previously filed financial statements. Material Adverse Outcome includes occurrences that lead to a 5% or more reduction in revenue or net income for the Company for any fiscal
quarter. The Material Adverse Outcome performance-based vesting condition is not applicable to PSUs, which include other performance-based
vesting conditions. In addition to the cancellation and clawback provisions described in the table above, to comply with UK and E.U. regulatory guidance,
additional cancellation and clawback terms are applicable to Messrs. Morton’s and Ybarra’s incentive awards covering various
compliance issues. We will consider making public disclosures whenever
a decision has been made to cancel deferred compensation payable to an executive officer because he or she had significant responsibility
for a Material Adverse Outcome or otherwise. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 100 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation Compensation Governance Practices We have strong compensation governance practices that
are regularly refined as a result of engagement with stockholders and regulators and our attention to evolving best practices. CITI’S
    PRACTICES PRACTICES
    WE AVOID Performance-based compensation. For 2023, variable performance-based
    incentive compensation was more than 90% of CEO annual compensation. 85% of incentive compensation is delivered in deferred equity or
    equity-linked units, and the equity-linked units are subject to vesting based on three-year performance-based financial metrics and 60%
    of incentive compensation for our other NEOs is paid on a deferred basis and delivered in deferred equity or equity-linked
    units. Operational performance metrics. Our PSU program includes two
    performance metrics – return on tangible common equity and tangible book value per share – that are operational metrics used
    by investors to assess our performance. We disclose the target goals for the metrics at the start of the performance period to enable
    stockholders to assess the rigor of our goals. Targets for 2023 PSU awards are described on page 91. Equity-based compensation. Seventy percent of the total CEO incentive
    opportunity is awarded as equity-based, deferred long-term incentive compensation. Rigorous performance-assessment process. CART facilitates a rigorous
    performance-assessment process under which the Compensation Committee participates in the development of a comprehensive written analysis
    of executive officer performance in respect of the four pillars. Rigorous targets. Our PSU target goals generally require operational
    improvements for target payout. Stockholder transparency. We provide transparency in our annual
    proxy statement concerning the process and metrics evaluated by the Compensation Committee in determining incentive compensation for our
    NEOs. For example, we disclose the performance goals for our PSU program at the beginning of each three-year performance
    cycle. Our extensive disclosure of individual named executive officer performance describes the rigorous process we use for determining
    compensation. No excessive perks. We do not provide excessive perquisites such
    as free personal use of private aircraft or special executive medical benefits. No executive pensions. Executive officers are not eligible for
    additional pensions under executive retirement programs. No hedging or pledging of Citi stock. We have a blanket prohibition
    against hedging or pledging our common stock by executive officers and also prohibit our executive officers from engaging in speculative
    trading in Citi common stock. No tax gross-ups. We do not allow tax gross-ups except through
    our tax equalization program for expatriates, which is available to all salaried employees. No multi-year compensation guarantees. We avoid features that
    could incentivize imprudent risk-taking, such as multi-year guarantees. No “single trigger” upon a change of control. Our
    stock incentive plan has a “double trigger” change-of-control feature, meaning that both a change of control of Citigroup
    and an involuntary termination of employment not for gross misconduct must occur for awards to vest. No change-of-control or other “golden parachute” agreements. Executive officers do not have special agreements covering their compensation in the event of a change of control. Termination pay limits. Executive officers are not entitled to
    severance pay upon termination of employment in excess of broad-based benefits. In the U.S. those benefits are capped at $500,000. Since
    2002, the Company has been prohibited without the approval of its stockholders from entering into an employment agreement with an executive
    officer that provides, upon a termination of employment following a change-of-control, cash payments in excess of three times the executive
    officer’s taxable income. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 101 Risk and control management. Effective management of risk and
    control is a key driver in determining compensation for executive officers. Regulatory requirements. Our governance practices are designed
    to comply with the principles for sound incentive compensation practices promulgated by our regulators, who provide ongoing oversight
    and engagement in respect of those practices. Clawbacks. Our PSUs and Deferred Stock Awards are subject to clawbacks,
    as described on page 99. Stock ownership commitment. Under our policies, executive officers
    are required to hold at least 75% of the net after-tax shares acquired through our incentive compensation programs as long as they are
    executive officers. Post-employment stock holding requirement. Our policies require
    each executive officer to retain at least 50% of the shares subject to the stock ownership commitment for one year after ceasing to be
    an executive officer, even if he or she is no longer employed by us. Peer group review. The Compensation Committee annually evaluates
    our industry peer group to ensure that inclusion of each member continues to be appropriate for compensation benchmarking purposes. Compensation Committee independent advice and executive sessions. An independent compensation consultant attends Compensation Committee meetings and provides the Compensation Committee with advice. The
    Compensation Committee regularly meets in executive session without management present, both with and without its independent advisor. Annual risk assessment. As part of our governance process, all
    our incentive compensation plans throughout the world are analyzed through a central risk management model developed and administered
    by a third-party consultant with input from us. Governance. We have strong compensation governance practices,
    including a disciplined and systematic process for taking risk into account in compensation decisions. The Board of Directors reviews
    all stockholder proposals, including those related to executive compensation. No unearned dividends paid . We pay dividend equivalents on our
    PSUs and Deferred Stock Awards only if and when the underlying awards are earned and delivered. The dividend rate is the same for the
    executive officers as for other stockholders. No extensive use of employment agreements. Except as required
    by law, we do not use fixed-term employment agreements for executive officers. Agreements with executive officers may not provide for
    post-retirement personal benefits of a kind not generally available to other employees or retirees. No “springloading” of equity awards. Citi does not
    time the granting of equity awards to take advantage of information that may enhance their value to recipients. STOCKHOLDER
    ENGAGEMENT AND STOCKHOLDER FEEDBACK Our executive compensation program reflects feedback
received from investors through an extensive stockholder engagement process. The chair of the Compensation Committee and management
conduct regular stockholder engagement to solicit feedback on compensation and governance. In 2023, we held two rounds of stockholder
engagement with holders of meaningful percentages of our outstanding shares. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 102 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation ● Spring
2023: Following the awards for 2022 performance but in advance of our 2023 Annual Meeting, Mr. Dugan, our Board Chair, who was then chair of
our Compensation Committee, joined by the Chair of our Risk Management Committee, who was a member of the Compensation Committee, and
is the New Chair of the Compensation Committee, led a stockholder outreach effort seeking feedback on the executive compensation awards.
In this round of engagement, we reached out to stockholders representing approximately 38% of our outstanding shares and spoke to stockholders
representing approximately 34.4% of our outstanding shares. The feedback we received on our executive pay program was broadly favorable,
reflecting the numerous changes made in previous years in direct response to stockholder comments. Noting no concerns that merited discussion,
investors representing approximately 3.5% of our outstanding shares declined our invitation to participate in the Spring 2023 engagement
effort. ● Fall/Winter
2023: In the Fall of 2023, we conducted a second round of engagement with stockholders representing approximately 21% of our outstanding
shares in a series of meetings that focused on executive compensation as well as sustainability issues, including climate change and Citi’s
net zero plan and human capital management. In the area of human capital management, the topics included our racial equity audit, diverse
representation in senior roles at Citi, talent development and succession planning and gender pay equity. OUR
    SAY ON PAY RESULTS While we strive to continuously improve
our practices, we were pleased with the positive feedback from our stockholders and their endorsement of our executive compensation program,
which resulted in an 92.66% favorable say on pay vote at our 2023 Annual Meeting. OUR
    INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT FW Cook has been the Compensation Committee’s
independent advisor since 2012. FW Cook provides no services to us other than its services to the Board of Directors, has no other ties
to management that could jeopardize its fully independent status, and has strong internal governance policies that help ensure it maintains
its independence. Representatives of FW Cook attended all Compensation Committee meetings during 2023, including executive sessions as
requested, and engaged with Compensation Committee members between meetings. FW Cook advised the Compensation Committee regarding the
compensation awarded to the CEO and other executive officers. FW Cook also provided extensive guidance and analysis regarding the
Compensation Committee’s and the Board of Director’s responses to our advisory say on pay votes, offered market insights,
and provided advice to the Compensation Committee on our executive compensation plan design and the presentation of our programs to stockholders
through the investor outreach process described earlier as well as required SEC disclosures. FW Cook also provides advice to the Board
of Directors on non-executive director compensation. Pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules, the Compensation Committee assessed the independence
of FW Cook, most recently in March 2023, and determined that FW Cook is independent from our management and that its work for the Compensation
Committee has not raised any conflicts of interest. TAX
    DEDUCTIBILITY OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits
our ability to deduct compensation paid to our NEOs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally to $1 million
per year. Further, once any of our employees is considered a “covered employee” under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue
Code, that person will remain a “covered employee” so long as the person receives compensation from Citi. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation 103 The Compensation, Performance Management and Culture

                                                                                                            not a Citi executive officer on December 31, 2023, but his 2023 and prior-year compensation is required to be disclosed under
                                                                                                            SEC rules. (2) Amounts in this column show cash bonuses for service in the listed year. (3) In accordance with
                                            SEC rules, the amounts in this column for 2023 are the aggregate grant date fair values of
                                            PSUs and Deferred Stock Awards awarded during 2023 under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, even
                                            where performance related to 2022. SEC rules require the presentation of equity awards granted
                                            during calendar year 2023, not equity awards made in respect of performance in 2023. The
                                            separate grant date value of each award shown in the Stock Award column is disclosed in the
                                            2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 106. The aggregate grant date fair values
                                            of the awards shown in this column are computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
                                            Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (ASC 718). The assumptions made, if any,
                                            when calculating the amounts in this column are found in Note 7 to the Consolidated
                                            Financial Statements of Citigroup Inc. and its subsidiaries, as filed with the SEC on Form
                                            10-K for 2023. The amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table for the PSUs are the
                                            values at the grant date as determined in accordance with ASC 718, which take into account
                                            the probable outcome of the performance conditions. Consequently, these values differ from
                                            the nominal amounts of the awards made by the Compensation Committee, which are divided by

                                                                                   performance conditions are achieved, are: Ms. Fraser, $17,250,000; Mr. Mason, $5,868,000; and Mr. Selvakesari, $5,108,625 (4) The amounts shown in this column represent the cash settled amounts of the first and second tranches of each Transformation Bonus
Award, Deferred Cash Award and notional interest considered earned by the Named Executive Officer in the applicable year, even though
the awards were granted in prior years in respect of prior-year service. Deferred Cash Awards were granted to executives (1) who are not
eligible for PSUs, which were awarded only to the CEO and executives who report directly to her or (2) whose compensation is designed
to comply with UK and E.U. regulatory guidance, such as Messrs. Morton and Ybarra. Generally, these awards vest in equal portions over
four years and are credited with notional interest at market rates, subject to regulatory requirements. In addition, Ms. Fraser and Mr.
Selvakesari were granted special deferred incentive awards in 2019, which are included in the amount shown for them in this column. No notional interest is paid in connection with Ms. Fraser’s or Mr. Selvakesari’s
special award. Ms. Fraser and Mr. Sieg were not eligible for Transformation Bonus Awards. The table below shows the portion of the amount
set forth in the column that represents each such component of compensation. Name Deferred Cash Award Notional Interest Transformation Bonus Award Jane

                                            tranche of the Transformation Bonus Award because the payment of this award is designed to
                                            comply with UK and E.U. regulatory guidance. Messrs. Morton and Ybarra’s Deferred Cash
                                            Awards are denominated in British pounds because they relate to their service in London.
                                            They are shown as converted from British pounds to U.S. dollars at the December 31, 2023,
                                            conversion rate used to prepare Citi’s financial statements (1 British pound = 1.2748
                                            U.S. dollars). A portion of Mr. Selvakesari’s Deferred Cash Awards are denominated
                                            in Singapore dollars because they relate to his service in Singapore. They are shown as converted
                                            from Singapore dollars to U.S. dollars at the December 31, 2023, conversion rate used to

                                            Transformation Bonus Program awards are described in more detail on pages 94 to 95. (5) These amounts represent the increases in the present value of pension benefits for Messrs. Mason, Sieg, and Ybarra, as more fully
described in the 2023 Pension Benefits Table. The amount of each named executive officer’s above-market or preferential earnings
on compensation that was deferred on a basis that was not tax-qualified was $0. (6) Set forth below is a breakdown of All Other Compensation for 2023 (including personal benefits): Name 401(k)

                                                                                   contribution from a broad-based retirement plan and is determined according to a generally applicable formula. The amount in the

beginning in 2022. Specifically, the timing of amounts reported as bonus and as stock awards changed by reason of the change in the form
of Ms. Fraser’s 2022 incentive compensation from 30% cash to 15% cash. (8) 2021 compensation amounts for Messrs. Morton, Selvakesari, and Sieg, and 2022 amounts for Messrs. Morton and Sieg are not required

                                            amounts shown for 2023 relative to prior years reflect, in part, a change in the form of

                                            the actual value that may be realized by the named executive officer. The amounts reported
                                            in the 2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table for the PSUs are the values at the grant date
                                            under applicable accounting principles, which take into account the probable outcome of the
                                            performance conditions. Consequently, these values differ from the nominal amount of the

                                            Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Citigroup Inc. and its subsidiaries, as
                                            filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for 2023. Benefits in the 2023 Pension Benefits Table have
                                            been calculated using a normal retirement age of 65, as defined in the plans. (2) Mr.
                                            Sieg was previously employed by Citigroup from 2005 through 2009. Citi’s
policy is that executives should accrue retirement benefits on the same basis generally available to Citi employees under Citi’s
broad-based, tax-qualified retirement plans. Citi has not granted extra years of credited service under any retirement plan to any of
the NEOs. Ms. Fraser and Messrs. Selvakesari and Morton have never been eligible to participate in a defined benefit
pension plan under the terms of Citi’s broad-based retirement programs in effect in their employment countries; they have participated
only in defined contribution retirement plans since the commencement of their employment at Citi. The
following describes the pension plans listed in the 2023 Pension Benefits Table. The
Citigroup Pension Plan. The purpose of this broad-based, tax-qualified retirement plan is to provide retirement income on a
tax-deferred basis to all eligible U.S. employees. Effective December 31, 2006, The Citigroup Pension Plan was closed to new members
and generally ceased benefit accruals effective December 31, 2007. Mr. Mason and Mr. Sieg are eligible for benefits under this plan.
Their entire benefits are cash balance benefits. The
Citigroup Pension Plan cash balance benefit is expressed as a hypothetical account balance. Prior to January 1, 2008, the plan generally
provided for the annual accrual of benefit credits for most of the covered population, including the covered NEOs,
at a rate between 1.5% and 6% of eligible compensation; the benefit credit rate increased with age and service. Eligible compensation
generally included base salary and incentive awards, but excluded compensation payable after termination of employment, certain non-recurring
payments, and other benefits. Annual eligible compensation was limited by the Internal Revenue Code to $225,000 for 2007 (the final year
of cash balance benefit accrual). Interest credits continue to be applied annually to each participant’s account balance; these
credits are based on the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds (as published by the Internal Revenue Service). Benefits
under The Citigroup Pension Plan are payable in annuity form or in other optional forms, including a lump sum, upon termination of employment.
The Citigroup Pension Plan’s normal retirement age is 65. The portion of an eligible participant’s benefit determined under
the Citibank Retirement Plan formula may be paid upon early retirement, which is defined for this purpose as the first day of the month
after the later of the participant’s 55th birthday or the date on which the participant completes a year of service (as defined
in the plan). The
Retirement Plan for Specified Non-United States International Staff of Citibank, N.A. and Participating Companies (International Staff
Plan). The International Staff Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that was offered to a select group
of management or highly compensated employees. The International Staff Plan provided a retirement benefit to internationally mobile staff
participating in the Citi Expatriate Program who, due to their mobile status, were ineligible for any other Citi defined benefit retirement
plan. Benefits mirrored the Citibank Retirement Plan and, after 1999, The Citigroup Pension Plan. The International Staff Plan closed
to new members and generally ceased benefit accruals effective December 31, 2007, like The Citigroup Pension Plan. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 110 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation Mr.
Ybarra accrued benefits under the International Staff Plan from 1994 through 2007. From 1994 through 1999, Mr. Ybarra accrued an International
Staff Plan benefit determined using the Citibank Retirement Plan formula described above, and from 2000 through 2007, Mr. Ybarra accrued
an International Staff Plan benefit determined using The Citigroup Pension Plan cash balance benefit formula previously described. Limits
on eligible compensation and benefits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on tax-qualified retirement plans generally did not apply
to International Staff Plan benefit accruals because the International Staff Plan is nonqualified; however, the International Staff Plan
was amended over time to include certain limits. Effective January 1, 2000, eligible compensation under the International Staff Plan
was limited to $500,000, and effective January 1, 2002, the limit on eligible compensation imposed by the Internal Revenue Code applied
to International Staff Plan benefit accruals. Mr.
Ybarra is eligible for early retirement under the Citibank Retirement Plan formula, meaning that he is eligible for a benefit, actuarially
reduced for early commencement, under the International Staff Plan commencing upon his termination of employment. He is eligible for
an unreduced benefit commencing immediately. The International Staff Plan offered lump sum and life annuity distribution options to participants. Payments
upon Termination or Change of Control General
Policies. Citi does not provide guaranteed executive severance or change of control agreements. Potential
Payments Table. Set forth below is a table showing the estimated value of outstanding awards that would have been delivered
over time to each named executive officer employed by Citi on December 31, 2023, had the applicable employment termination or other event
occurred on December 31, 2023 and assuming that all award vesting and performance conditions are satisfied. Unless the awards are forfeited,
the awards shown in the Potential Payments Table vest on schedule following termination of employment and do not accelerate by their
terms except in the case of death. The closing price of Citi’s common stock on December 31, 2023 ($51.44) was used in developing
the estimates shown in the Potential Payments Table. Name Change

                                            that the Citi common stock price at December 31, 2023 remained unchanged through the final

amounts set forth in the table above illustrate the relationships, for the years indicated, between (1) the compensation actually paid
(as defined by SEC rules) to our CEO and other NEOs, and (2) our total stockholder return, Net Income and RoTCE.
The relationships evidence the adherence of our compensation decisions to the principles set forth in our Compensation Philosophy, described
on page 77. Specifically: ● More than half of the compensation of our CEO and other NEOs was granted in an equity-linked award, which aligns our
compensation programs, structures and decisions with stockholders’ interests. The value each executive receives is not fixed and
delivered until the scheduled payment date. ● “Compensation actually paid”, as defined by the SEC’s disclosure rules, is linked to changes in our Net Income and RoTCE by virtue of the relationship between those metrics and the value of shares of Citi common stock. However, the “compensation
actually paid” in the table above does not reflect the full extent of the alignment between the compensation we actually paid and
our total stockholder return, because changes in the value of vested (but unpaid) Deferred Stock Awards are not reflected in “compensation
actually paid”. PSUs, for purposes of the table above, do reflect such alignment, as the compensation actually paid for PSUs do fluctuate based on the value of Citi common stock. ● Changes in the “compensation actually paid” to each executive is most impacted by the historical composition of their compensation
packages - specifically, in the percentage of compensation in the form of PSUs granted to each executive. PSUs are granted to our EMT, including for 2023 to EMT members residing in the UK. Three of our six 2023 NEOs were not granted PSUs in 2023. The
following is a tabular list of the financial performance measures that the Company has determined represent the most important financial
performance measures used to link compensation actually paid for 2023 to Citi’s performance: ● RoTCE ● Tangible
                                            Book Value per Share ● Net
                                            Income RoTCE
and Tangible Book Value per Share are the financial metrics that comprise the performance-based vesting conditions for our PSUs, as described
on pages 91 to 92. Net Income affects RoTCE and is taken into account as an important factor in our performance assessments, as
described above. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 114 Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive Compensation Additional
Compensation Disclosures Our
Annual Management Analysis of Potential Adverse Effects of Compensation Plans Citi
has adopted multiple coordinated strategies to manage the risk of material adverse effects to the franchise through the design and administration
of its incentive compensation programs, including those applicable to the NEOs. Those strategies, including regular
analyses and reviews by Citi’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, are detailed on pages 79 to 80 and 99. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, management has concluded that Citi’s compensation plans are not reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on Citi. CEO
Pay Ratio As
required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are providing the following information
about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees to the annual total compensation of our CEO. The pay ratio included
in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. ● For 2023, the median annual total compensation of all employees of our Company (other
than the CEO) was $70,731, and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $25,472,477. (1) ● Based on this information, for 2023, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median
annual total compensation of all employees was estimated to be 360. (1) This
                                            number is the sum of the 2023 total compensation reported in the 2023 Summary Compensation
                                            Table and the value of employer contributions to broad-based employee benefit plans not already
                                            included in the Summary Compensation Table. The
following summarizes how we calculated our CEO pay: ● The
                                            “median annual total compensation of all employees” is the annual total compensation
                                            of a single employee who is at the midpoint of employees ranked in order of compensation
                                            amounts. When determining our midpoint, we considered compensation of approximately 240,000
                                            Citi employees (other than the CEO) who were employed by Citi on December 31, 2023, in about
                                            100 countries. We did not exclude any countries and we did not make any adjustments for the
                                            cost of living. We applied the data used to determine the 2023 median in the calculation
                                            of the 2023 ratio. ● SEC
                                            regulations allow employers to identify the midpoint based on a “consistently applied
                                            compensation measure” (CACM). We used 2023 base pay and awards under our incentive
                                            compensation plans as our CACM to determine the midpoint of our employee population. We chose
                                            this CACM because these two pay elements were consistently available across all countries
                                            in which we have employees. Ø Compensation
                                            paid in foreign currency was converted to U.S. dollars using a monthly average. ● We
                                            then calculated the 2023 “annual total compensation” for a group of representative
                                            employees with compensation at or very near our 2023 midpoint (our “midpoint group”).
                                            We used the 2023 annual total compensation of the employee with 2023 annual total compensation
                                            at approximately the median of our midpoint group to determine our CEO pay ratio. Ø In
                                            determining the “annual total compensation” for each employee in our midpoint
                                            group, we followed the methodology required under SEC regulations for calculating the total
                                            compensation of our NEOs as reported in the Summary Compensation Table
                                            and added the value of employer contributions to broad-based employee benefit plans not already
                                            included in the Summary Compensation Table. ● The
                                            SEC rules for identifying the median-paid employee and calculating the CEO pay ratio allow
                                            companies to apply various methodologies and assumptions and, as a result, the CEO pay ratio
                                            reported by Citi may not be comparable to the CEO pay ratio reported by other companies. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents 115 Proposal
4: Approval of Additional Shares for, and a Term Extension and Restatement of, the Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive
Plan On
the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors has approved amendments to, and the restatement of, the Citigroup
2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2019 Plan). In general, the amendments would: extend the term of the Plan by five years to a date
ending on the date of the 2029 Annual Meeting; increase the authorized number of shares available for grant by 30 million; clarify
certain provisions with respect to equitable adjustments, minimum vesting requirements, and adjustments in performance conditions in
connection with a change in control; and reflect the Company’s adoption of mandatory clawback provisions regarding the recoupment
of erroneously awarded incentive compensation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Clawback
Provisions). The discussion and description of the 2019 Plan, as amended and restated, that follows is qualified in its entirety by the
text of the amended and restated 2019 Plan that is included as Annex B. Board
    Recommendation The
    Board recommends that you vote FOR approval of the amendments to, and restatement of, the Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, as described in Proposal 4. Executive
Summary ● 30 million additional shares for issuance under the 2019 Plan are being requested. ● A
                                            five-year extension of the term of the Plan is being requested. ● Other
                                            changes being proposed for approval for the 2019 Plan include: clarifying certain provisions,
                                            including those regarding equitable adjustments, minimum vesting requirements, and adjustments
                                            in performance conditions in connection with a change in control; and reflecting the Company’s
                                            adoption of the Dodd-Frank Clawback Provisions. ● For 2023, we granted stock-based awards to approximately 12,000 employees. Of the total number of shares subject to such awards, more than 95% were granted to non-section 16 officers. ● Our equity awards are intended to align incentive compensation programs with Citi’s long-term business objectives, the interests
of stockholders, and market practices, to attract and retain employees by providing compensation opportunities that are competitive within
the global financial services industry and to provide compensation opportunities that do not create, but rather help to mitigate, incentives
to take imprudent risks. ● For
                                            the reasons discussed in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis on pages 72 through 102
                                            above, the amount of compensation paid to our senior executives is performance-based and
                                            appropriate. The compensation paid to our senior executives disclosed in this Proxy includes
                                            our equity awards. ● As
                                            of March 4, 2024: Ø 12.4 million shares are reserved for issuance and available for grant under the 2019 Plan Ø No

                                            million total shares of Citi common stock were outstanding. ● In
                                            2024, we granted Deferred Stock Awards related to 29.3 million shares in respect of 2023
                                            service, compared to Deferred Stock Awards related to 34.3 million shares in respect of 2022 service. ● We
                                            have strong equity award practices, including a minimum one-year vesting requirement applicable
                                            to at least 95% of the shares granted under the 2019 Plan, stringent change of control provisions,
                                            and an annual limit on the number of shares and SARs that may be granted to employees. The
                                            2019 Plan has a fixed number of shares available for grant and limits on dividends and dividend
                                            equivalent payments. ● We
                                            propose to add language to the Plan authorizing sub-plans offering tax-qualified awards in
                                            certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, including France. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 116 PROPOSAL
    4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR, and a TERM EXTENSION AND RESTATEMENT Our
Recent Share Requests At
the 2019 Annual Meeting, stockholders approved the 2019 Plan, including an initial share authorization of 30 million shares. The initial
authorization was estimated to be approximately equal to the shares that would no longer be available for grant upon the expiration of
the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan); no additional shares were requested at our 2019 Annual Meeting. The initial share authorization
under the 2019 Plan was intended to support grant activity for at least one year. At the 2020 Annual Meeting, we requested and received
approval for an additional 15 million shares; at the 2021 Annual Meeting we requested and received approval for an additional 20 million
shares; at the 2022 Annual Meeting we requested and received approval for an additional 36 million shares; and at the 2023
Annual Meeting we requested and received approval for an additional 28 million shares. In each case, the request was intended to support
grant activity for one year. Beginning with incentive compensation for services rendered in 2021, 100% of deferrals for all employees
eligible for annual discretionary bonuses were indexed to and paid in Citi stock, where local regulations permit. Previously, some incentive
compensation was paid in deferred cash with interest. Our current share request is consistent with our approach on share authorizations,
which is to request increases as often as annually but only as needed to support grant activities for at least one year. Our
Equity Award Practices Are Aligned with Stockholder Interests ● Equity
                                            compensation aligns employee and stockholder interests. Citi’s equity awards are a key component of
annual incentive awards for thousands of employees worldwide, thereby aligning the interests of stockholders
and a broader group of Citi employees (not just senior executives). In 2024, approximately 12,000 employees in 63
countries received equity awards under the 2019 Plan as part of our annual bonus program. ● Citi
                                            has prudent equity award practices. Ø All
                                            deferred equity awards have cancellation and clawback provisions. Citi’s equity
                                            awards are subject to cancellation and clawback provisions covering a range of circumstances,
                                            as set forth on page 99. In 2023, we added a mandatory clawback policy pursuant to Section
                                            954 of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable NYSE listing standards for our equity awards to
                                            applicable covered executive officers. Ø Incentive compensation levels at which equity awards are used are consistent with market practices. Equity awards are granted to employees whose annual incentive compensation levels exceed certain thresholds. Those thresholds, and the
percentage of annual incentive compensation that is delivered in the form of equity awards, are consistent with market practices used
at U.S.-based global banks with lines of business and scale similar to ours. Ø Stock
                                            ownership requirements. Executive officers are generally required to hold at least
                                            75% of the net after-tax shares acquired through Citi’s incentive compensation programs
                                            as long as they are executive officers and are required to retain at least 50% of the shares
                                            subject to the stock ownership commitment for one year after ceasing to be an executive officer,
                                            as a result of leaving Citi employment or otherwise. Ø Share
                                            buybacks offset dilution from equity compensation programs. During 2023, we returned
                                            nearly $2 billion in capital to our stockholders through share repurchases. ● Equity
                                            compensation helps Citi to comply with its regulatory obligations. Regulatory guidance
                                            in the U.S. and in other countries in which Citi does business provides that a substantial
                                            portion of variable compensation awarded to senior executives and other employees whose actions
                                            have a material impact on the risk exposure of Citi should be awarded in shares. ● Equity compensation helps Citi to focus employees on achieving our objectives. By aligning employees’ personal financial circumstances with the interests of Citi’s senior management and stockholders, and
giving employees a direct economic stake in the performance of Citi’s stock, we incentivize employees to prioritize helping Citi
to achieve the financial goals presented at our 2022 Investor Day and to accomplish our strategic priorities described on page 75. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL

Plan Terms Are Aligned with Stockholder Interests The
following features of the 2019 Plan protect the interests of our stockholders: ● No
                                            “evergreen” feature. The 2019 Plan has a fixed number of shares available
                                            for grant that will not automatically increase because of an “evergreen” feature. ● Minimum
                                            one-year vesting requirement. Our one-year minimum vesting requirement will generally
                                            apply to at least 95% of the shares that may be granted pursuant to any type of award. ● A
                                            limit on total annual compensation for Directors. The maximum number of shares subject
                                            to awards to an individual Director in a calendar year, taken together with any cash fees
                                            paid during the calendar year to the Director for services as a member of the Board of Directors
                                            may not exceed $1 million in value, except where the Board of Directors approves a higher
                                            limit for a non-executive Board chair. ● Annual
                                            limits on shares and options or stock appreciation rights (SARs) that can be granted to individual
                                            employees. The 2019 Plan limits the number of shares subject to stock options and
                                            SARs that may be granted in a calendar year to an individual employee to one million shares.
                                            Separately, the 2019 Plan limits the number of shares subject to stock awards that may be
                                            granted in a calendar year to an individual employee to one million shares. ● No
                                            discounted options or SARs. Option or SAR exercise prices must be at least 100%
                                            of fair market value on the date an option or SAR is granted. ● No
                                            repricings or cash buyouts. The 2019 Plan prohibits any “repricing”
                                            of any outstanding option or SAR, except with the approval of the stockholders of the Company.
                                            The 2019 Plan defines “repricing” to mean (i) any action that constitutes
                                            a “repricing” under GAAP or the rules of the NYSE (including any modification
                                            or amendment to an outstanding option or SAR that has the effect of reducing its exercise
                                            price); (ii) any cancellation of an outstanding option or SAR when its exercise price exceeds
                                            its fair market value in exchange for cash; (iii) any cancellation of an option or SAR in
                                            exchange for a new option or SAR with a lower exercise price; or (iv) a substitution of a
                                            stock award for an option or SAR when its exercise price exceeds fair market value; in each
                                            case other than a permitted equitable adjustment. ● No
                                            reload option grants. Reload options are additional options that are granted automatically
                                            upon the exercise of previously granted options; options granted under the 2019 Plan may
                                            not include a reload feature. ● No

                                            of shares, the shares subject to such award will be available for future grants under the
                                            2019 Plan. However, the 2019 Plan prohibits re-granting shares withheld or tendered to pay

                                            condition. The 2019 Plan permits payment of dividends or dividend equivalents on
                                            shares of restricted or deferred stock subject to a performance vesting condition only if
                                            and when the underlying shares vest. The 2019 Plan also prohibits the payment of dividends
                                            and dividend equivalents on shares subject to outstanding options and SARs. ● A
                                            “double trigger” change of control provision. The 2019 Plan requires
                                            that participants must experience an involuntary termination of employment for an award to
                                            vest as a result of a change of control of Citigroup Inc. (a “double trigger”).
                                            The Compensation Committee has also adopted a policy affirming that no deferred incentive
                                            awards to executive officers will vest solely by reason of a change of control of Citigroup
                                            Inc. ● No
                                            excise tax gross-ups. The 2019 Plan does not provide for excise tax gross-ups in
                                            the event of a change of control of Citigroup Inc., nor do any executive agreements. ● No
                                            liberal definition of change of control. Our definition of “change of control”
                                            of Citigroup Inc. requires the consummation, and not merely the approval, of a reorganization,
                                            merger, consolidation, or other corporate transaction that results in stockholders of Citigroup
                                            Inc. not owning more than 50% of the combined voting power of Citigroup Inc. or other corporation
                                            resulting from such transaction. Additionally, the 2019 Plan defines a “change of control”
                                            of Citigroup Inc. to mean: (i) a person acquiring direct or indirect beneficial ownership
                                            of Citigroup Inc. securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of then
                                            outstanding securities of Citigroup Inc.; (ii) specified changes in the majority of the Board
                                            (not including the election of Directors whose election or nomination was approved by a majority
                                            of the then incumbent Board); (iii) a sale, transfer, or distribution of all or substantially
                                            all of the assets of Citigroup Inc., or a dissolution or liquidation of Citigroup Inc.; or
                                            (iv) the consummation of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other corporate transaction
                                            that results in stockholders of Citigroup Inc. not owning more than 50% of the combined voting
                                            power of Citigroup Inc. or other corporation resulting from the transaction. ● Ability
                                            to adopt sub-plans that facilitate participation by employees located outside the United
                                            States. Any special terms or conditions that the Compensation Committee considers
                                            necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in non-U.S. law, tax policy, or custom
                                            may be included in a sub-plan that forms a part of the 2019 Plan. We intend to consider the

is included as Annex B. If Proposal 4 is approved by stockholders at our Annual Meeting, we intend to file a registration statement on
Form S-8, pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to register the additional shares authorized for grant under the 2019 Plan. General. The
2019 Plan became effective on April 16, 2019 and will expire on the date of the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders unless this Proposal
4 is approved by stockholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting. The 2019 Plan provides for various types of awards denominated in shares of
Citi common stock to Citi employees, officers, and non-employee Directors. The NYSE closing price of a share of Citi common stock on
March 4, 2024 was $56.14. Administration. The
2019 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. All members of such Committee or a sub-committee thereof must satisfy the requirements
for independence of SEC Rule 16b-3. With respect to participants who are outside Directors, the 2019 Plan is administered by the Board
of Directors. The Compensation Committee may delegate some or all of its authority over administration of the 2019 Plan to one or more
officers, directors, employees, or another plan administrator except with respect to persons who are Section 16(a) officers. In addition,
any special terms or conditions that the Compensation Committee considers necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in non-U.S.
law, tax policy or custom may be included in a sub-plan that forms a part of the 2019 Plan. Eligibility. All
“employees” of Citi—within the broad definition set forth in the instructions to the SEC Form S-8 registration
statement, as in effect on April 16, 2019 with respect to the Citi or any of its subsidiaries, but expressly excluding consultants
and advisors who are not members of the Board of Directors—generally are eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Plan. Based
on worldwide employment at December 31, 2023, approximately 239,000 persons could be eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan.
However, participation is discretionary—awards are subject to approval by the Compensation Committee. In general, employees
with discretionary annual incentive awards of at least $75,000 are eligible to receive at least 15% of that annual award in
deferred stock. For the twelve months ending March 1, 2024, awards were made under the 2019 Plan to 12 non-employee Directors, 18
executive officers, and approximately 12,000 employees worldwide. Former “employees” are eligible to participate in the
2019 Plan, but only with respect to their last year of service or in connection with a sale, spin-off or other similar
transaction. Shares
subject to the 2019 Plan. Shares of Citi common stock issued in connection with awards under the 2019 Plan may be shares that
are authorized but unissued, or previously issued shares that have been reacquired, or both. The initial share authorization under the
2019 Plan was 30 million shares. Pursuant to amendments approved at the 2020 Annual Meeting, the 2021 Annual Meeting, the 2022 Annual
Meeting, and the 2023 Annual Meeting, the number of authorized shares increased by 15 million, 20 million, 36 million, and 28 million,
respectively. Pursuant to the amendment described in Proposal 4, the number of authorized shares would increase by 30 million. “Recycling”
provisions. If an award under the 2019 Plan, or, after April 16, 2019 (the effective date of the 2019 Plan), the 2014 Plan and
the 2009 Plan, is forfeited, cancelled, or expires or is settled without the issuance of shares, the shares subject to such award will
be available for future grants under the 2019 Plan. However, shares tendered by a participant or withheld by Citi to pay an option exercise
price, withheld or tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to any award, repurchased by Citi with option exercise proceeds,
covered by an option or stock-settled SAR (without regard to the number of shares actually issued upon exercise), or withheld to satisfy
any debt or other obligation owed to Citi, and cancelled fractional shares will be considered issued and shall not be added to the maximum
number of shares that may be issued under the 2019 Plan. Limits
on awards. The maximum number of shares subject to awards to an individual Director in a calendar year (including awards made
at the election of a Director in lieu of his or her cash retainer), taken together with any cash fees paid during the calendar year to
the Director, in respect of the Director’s service as a member of the Board of Directors during such year (including service as
a member or chair of any committees of the Board), may not exceed $1 million in value, as determined as of the date of each award. However,
the independent members of the Board of Directors may make exceptions to this limit for a non-executive chair of the Board, provided
that the Director Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL
4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR, and a TERM EXTENSION AND RESTATEMENT 121 receiving
any additional compensation may not participate in the decision to award such compensation. For all other eligible “employees,”
the number of shares subject to stock options or SARs granted during a calendar year may not exceed one million shares, and the number
of shares that may be subject to stock awards granted in a calendar year may not exceed one million shares, unless granted subject to
substitute awards that replace awards of a former employer acquired by the Company. Types
of awards. The following types of awards may be made under the 2019 Plan: ● Stock
                                            options. An award of a stock option under the 2019 Plan grants a participant the
                                            right to purchase a specified number of shares of Citi common stock during a specified term
                                            in the future at an exercise price equal to at least 100% of the “fair market value”
                                            (see below) of Citi common stock on the grant date. The term of a stock option may not exceed
                                            10 years from the date of grant. ● Stock
                                            appreciation rights (SARs). A SAR, upon exercise, entitles the participant to receive
                                            an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of Citi common stock on the
                                            exercise date and the exercise price of the SAR (which may not be less than 100% of fair
                                            market value of a share of Citi common stock on the grant date) times the number of shares
                                            subject to the SAR. Payment to a participant upon the exercise of a SAR may be in cash and/or
                                            shares of Citi common stock. The term of a SAR may not exceed 10 years from the date of the
                                            grant. Ø For
                                            purposes of setting the exercise price of any option or SAR granted under the 2019 Plan,
                                            “fair market value” means the closing price on the NYSE (or on the principal
                                            national securities exchange on which the common stock is traded or quoted, if not the NYSE)
                                            on the date on which the stock option or SAR is granted. For all other purposes under the
                                            2019 Plan, “fair market value” will be as determined by the Compensation Committee. ● Stock
                                            payment. The Compensation Committee may grant vested shares of Citi common stock
                                            as a stock payment. ● Restricted
                                            stock. A restricted stock award is an award of outstanding shares of Citi common
                                            stock that does not vest until vesting conditions are satisfied and which will be forfeited
                                            if conditions to vesting are not met. Participants may receive dividends on the shares subject
                                            to their awards during the vesting period, unless the awards are subject to one or more performance
                                            conditions, in which case the dividends, if any, shall be paid only if and when, and only
                                            to the extent that, the underlying shares vest. ● Deferred
                                            stock. A deferred stock award is an unfunded, unsecured promise to deliver shares
                                            of Citi common stock to the participant in the future, if the participant satisfies the conditions
                                            to vesting. Participants do not have voting rights (their rights are no greater than a general
                                            unsecured creditor of the Company), but may receive dividend equivalent payments during the
                                            vesting period, unless the awards are subject to one or more performance conditions, in which
                                            case the dividend equivalents, if any, shall be paid to participants only if and when, and
                                            only to the extent that, the underlying shares vest. ● Other
                                            stock-based awards. The Compensation Committee may grant any other award that is
                                            denominated in shares of Citi common stock and that may be settled by the delivery of shares
                                            and/or cash. For the avoidance of doubt, awards that by their terms shall be settled only
                                            in cash shall not be considered to have been granted under the 2019 Plan. ● Performance-based
                                            awards. Subject to the terms of the 2019 Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant
                                            awards that are subject to one or more performance conditions related to a performance period
                                            of not less than one year. Minimum
vesting requirement. Awards granted under the 2019 Plan may not vest earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which
the award is granted, except that the Compensation Committee may grant awards that vest in less than a year (i) as a “substitute
award” to replace awards of a former employer acquired by the Company, (ii) awards to Directors that vest on the earlier of the
one-year anniversary of the date of grant and the next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately
preceding year’s annual meeting, (iii) shares of Citi common stock delivered in lieu of fully vested cash obligations, and (iv)
any additional awards the Compensation Committee may grant, up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the available share reserve authorized
for issuance under the 2019 Plan. This restriction does not apply to the Compensation Committee’s discretion to provide for accelerated
exercisability or vesting of any award, including in cases of retirement, death, disability, leave of absence, termination of employment,
change of control, or upon the sale or other disposition of the subsidiary employing a participant or other similar event. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 122 PROPOSAL
4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR, and a TERM EXTENSION AND RESTATEMENT Performance
conditions. In the case of an award subject to a performance condition, the applicable performance condition may include one
or more of the following performance conditions and be expressed in either, or a combination of, absolute or relative values or a percentage
of: revenue, revenue or product growth, net income (pre- or after-tax), earnings, earnings per share, stockholders’ equity or return
on stockholders’ equity, assets or return on assets, return on risk-adjusted assets, capital or return on capital, return on risk
capital, return on tangible common equity, book value or book value per share, tangible book value per share, economic value-added models
or equivalent metrics, operating income, pre- or after-tax income, expenses or reengineering savings, margins, cash flow or cash flow
per share, stock price, total stockholder return, market share, debt reduction, net promoter scores, operating efficiency ratios, expense
ratios, liquidity ratios, regulatory achievements, or any objective or subjective performance conditions selected by the Compensation
Committee. Pursuant to the amendment described in Proposal 4, the Compensation Committee may make equitable adjustments to any performance
condition to the extent needed or appropriate to prevent the enlargement or diminution of the rights of participants; provided that in
the event of a change of control, such adjustment(s) must be made at the time of grant, or prior to, or coincident with, the change of
control. Prohibition
against repricing. The 2019 Plan prohibits any action under the 2019 Plan that would constitute a “repricing” of
any outstanding option or SAR granted under the 2019 Plan, the 2014 Plan, the 2009 Plan or any other plan of the Company or of any acquired
company, except with the approval of the stockholders of the Company. The 2019 Plan defines “repricing” to mean: (i) any
action that constitutes a “repricing” under GAAP or the rules of the NYSE (including any modification or amendment to an
outstanding option or SAR that has the effect of reducing its exercise price); (ii) any cancellation of an outstanding option or SAR
when its exercise price exceeds its fair market value in exchange for cash; (iii) any cancellation of an option or SAR in exchange for
a new option or SAR with a lower exercise price; or (iv) a substitution of a stock award for an option or SAR when its exercise price
exceeds fair market value; in each case other than a permitted equitable adjustment. Prohibition
of reload options. The 2019 Plan does not permit the grant of “reload” options. Repayment
obligation; right of set-off. If the Compensation Committee subsequently determines that all conditions to vesting and payment
of an award, or the vesting and exercisability of an option or SAR, were not satisfied in full, the Compensation Committee may cancel
such vesting or exercise and refuse to issue shares and immediately terminate the participant’s rights with respect to such award
(or improperly vested portion thereof). If the vesting or exercise of any such award (or portion thereof) has already been settled by
delivery of shares or cash, the participant shall be obligated, upon demand, to return the shares or cash (or higher value received at
vesting or exercise), to Citi, without reduction for any shares or cash withheld to satisfy withholding tax or other obligations. Consistent
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the 2019 Plan also provides for (x) the set-off of vested awards
against obligations a participant may owe to Citi, including but not limited to the obligation to repay improperly vested or exercised
awards, and (y) the set-off of any amount recovered by a participant, and to be paid by the Company, in the nature of severance pay or
compensation for hypothetical or potential future services in connection with any legal claim or action alleging violation of law relating
to the participant’s employment or termination thereof (whether by reason of a decision or settlement of such claim) against the
pre-tax amount the Company was required to pay for the participant’s account, including legal fees, in connection with such claim
or action. Any failure to timely pay tax-related obligations owed to Citi in connection with an award may result in its cancellation. Dodd-Frank
Act Mandatory Clawback of Erroneously Awarded Incentive Compensation. In 2023, the Company adopted the Dodd-Frank Clawback Provisions
in accordance with the applicable NYSE listing requirements, promulgated pursuant to the final rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission enacting the clawback standards of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Accordingly, erroneously awarded incentive
compensation, including equity awards awarded under the 2019 Plan, received by current or former executive officers of the Company are
subject to recovery by the Company to the extent required. Non-transferability. During
the vesting period, awards and sale-restricted shares generally are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL
4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR, and a TERM EXTENSION AND RESTATEMENT 123 Adjustments. The
2019 Plan provides that the Compensation Committee shall make appropriate equitable adjustments to the maximum number of shares available
for grant under the 2019 Plan and to the annual individual award limits expressed in numbers of shares in the event of any changes to
the Company’s capital structure, including a change in the number of shares outstanding on account of any stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, spinoff or any similar equity restructuring, or any combination or exchange of equity securities, merger,
consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization, or similar transaction or event affecting Citi’s capitalization. In the event
of any such transaction or event, or any extraordinary dividend, divestiture, or other distribution (other than ordinary cash dividends)
of assets to stockholders, the Compensation Committee shall make appropriate equitable adjustments to the number or kind of shares subject
to outstanding awards, or the exercise prices of outstanding options and SARs, to the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement or
diminution of participants’ rights. Change
of control. The Compensation Committee may, when an award is made, or at any time prior to, or coincident with, a “change
of control” (as defined below), provide for the adjustment of performance conditions to prevent the enlargement or diminution of
participants’ rights, provide for the cancellation of outstanding awards if the surviving entity or acquiring entity (or the surviving
or acquiring entity’s parent company) replaces the awards with new rights of substantially equivalent value, provide for the acceleration
of any time periods or the waiver of any other conditions to vesting, exercise, payment, or distribution of an award upon an involuntary
termination of a participant’s employment as a result of a change of control, or provide for the purchase of any award. Pursuant
to the amendments described in Proposal 4, the Compensation Committee would no longer be able to take such action after the time of a
change of control, and the Compensation Committee would be limited to only making adjustment(s) of performance conditions to the extent
necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of participants’ rights. The vesting, payment, purchase, or distribution of
an award, however, may not be accelerated by reason of a change of control for any participant unless the participant’s employment
is involuntarily terminated as a result of the change of control. For these purposes, a termination of employment as a result of a change
of control means involuntary termination of employment other than for “cause” (as defined in the 2019 Plan) upon, or on or
prior to the first anniversary of, the change of control. The
2019 Plan defines a “change of control” to mean (i) a person acquiring direct or indirect beneficial ownership of Citigroup
Inc. securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of then outstanding securities of Citigroup Inc.; (ii) specified
changes in the majority of the Board (not including the election of Directors whose election or nomination was approved by a majority
of the then incumbent Board); (iii) a sale, transfer, or distribution of all or substantially all of the assets of Citigroup Inc. or
a dissolution or liquidation of Citigroup Inc.; or (iv) consummation of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other corporate transaction
that results in stockholders of Citigroup Inc. not owning more than 50% of the combined voting power of Citigroup Inc. or other corporation
resulting from the transaction. Tax
withholding. Citi retains the right to deduct or withhold, or require the participant to remit to his or her employer, an amount
sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, and foreign taxes (including hypothetical taxes owed to Citi by tax-equalized expatriates)
required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event as a result of the 2019 Plan. Voting. The
2019 Plan provides that unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, participants who receive issued and outstanding shares
of Citi common stock that are subject to continuing restrictions pursuant the terms of a stock award are generally entitled to direct
the voting of the shares underlying their awards on matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. All shares underlying such awards as
to which no voting instructions are received are voted proportionately, based on the voting instructions received with respect to all
other such shares. Amendment
and termination. The 2019 Plan may be amended, suspended, or terminated by the Compensation Committee at any time, provided
that no amendment shall be made without stockholder approval if it would materially increase the number of shares available under the
2019 Plan (other than in connection with an equitable adjustment), materially expand the types of awards available under the 2019 Plan
or the class of persons eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan, materially extend the term of the 2019 Plan, materially change the
method of www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 124 PROPOSAL
4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR, and a TERM EXTENSION AND RESTATEMENT determining the exercise price of an option or SAR granted under the 2019 Plan, delete or limit the prohibition against “repricing,”
or otherwise require approval by stockholders in order to comply with applicable law or the rules of the NYSE (or principal national
securities exchange upon which Citi’s common stock is traded or quoted). Award
modification. The Compensation Committee retains the right to modify outstanding awards without a participant’s prior
consent if it determines that the modification is required to comply with applicable law, regulation, or regulatory guidance (including
applicable tax law). Subject to certain exceptions, any other modifications, if adverse to a participant, shall not be effective without
the participant’s written consent. Certain
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences The
following is a brief summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to stock options granted under the 2019 Plan,
based on current U.S. federal income tax laws. This summary does not constitute tax advice and, among other things, does not describe
state, local, or foreign tax consequences, which may be substantially different. Generally,
a participant will not recognize taxable income on the grant of a stock option. Upon the exercise of a stock option, a participant will
recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Citi common stock received on the
date of exercise and the option cost (number of shares purchased multiplied by the exercise price per share). The participant will recognize
ordinary income upon the exercise of the option even though the shares acquired may be subject to further restrictions on sale or transferability.
Citi will ordinarily be entitled to a deduction on the exercise date in an amount equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by
the participant upon exercise, except as may be specified under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, upon a subsequent
sale of shares acquired in an option exercise, the difference between the sale proceeds and the cost basis of the shares sold will be
taxable as a capital gain or loss, including any sale of shares freed from sale restrictions to fund the payment of taxes incurred at
exercise. The 2019 Plan does not provide for awards of “incentive stock options,” which have different tax consequences under
the Internal Revenue Code. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents 125 Stockholder
Proposals Citi
makes every effort to be responsive to concerns expressed by our stockholders by engaging in dialogues, participating in issuer/investor
working groups, and adopting policies or initiatives we believe to be in the best interests of all stockholders. Over the years, Citi
has met with several proponents and other interested parties regarding such issues as gender pay equity, proxy access, human rights,
climate change, net zero, racial equity, culture, risk management, auditor rotation, trade association payments, diversity and inclusion
risks, and viewpoint diversity, among others, and has, on certain occasions, as appropriate, taken action in response to these engagements
and/or stockholder votes. For example, in 2021, Citi collaborated with a stockholder to outline the scope of a Racial Equity Audit for
its Action for Racial Equity commitments and in 2019, Citi’s Board of Directors lowered the Special Meeting threshold in response
to the stockholder vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting. We encourage our stockholders to communicate with management and the Board. Any stockholder
wishing to communicate with management, the Board, or an individual Director, or obtain the addresses of any of the stockholder proponents
or their Citi stock ownership information, should send a request to the Corporate Secretary, Brent J. McIntosh, at 388 Greenwich Street,
New York, New York 10013. Proposal
5 Kenneth
Steiner has submitted the following proposal for consideration at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Proposal
5 – Independent Board Chairman Shareholders
request that the Board of Directors adopt an enduring policy, and amend the governing documents as necessary in order that 2 separate
people hold the office of the Chairman and the office of the CEO. Whenever
possible, the Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent Director. The
Board has the discretion to select a Temporary Chairman of the Board who is not an Independent Director to serve while the Board is seeking
an Independent Chairman of the Board on an acclerated basis. This
policy could be phased in when there is a contract renewal for our current CEO or for the next CEO transition. This
proposal topic won 52% support at Boeing and 54% support at Baxter International in 2020. Boeing then adopted this proposal topic. Management
says it supports having an independent Director in a Board leadership position. However management inconsistently has a bylaw that allows
it to indefinitely have one person hold the 2 most important jobs at Bank of America as long as there is a so-called lead director. The
so-called lead director could then have excessive board tenure that would impair director independence. The lead director could also
be a person who staunchly believes the 2 most important jobs in a $80 Billion company like Citigroup should be held by one person and
that the person holding the 2 positions at once should be given the upmost deference. A
lead director is no substitute for an independent board chairman. A lead director cannot call a special shareholder meeting and cannot
even call a special meeting of the board. A lead director can delegate most of his lead director duties to others and then simply rubber-stamp
it. There is no way shareholders can be sure of what goes on. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 126 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS A
lead director can be given a list of duties but there is no rule that prevents the Chairman from overriding the lead director in any
of the so-called lead director duties. Please
vote yes: Independent
Board Chairman – Proposal 5 Management
Comment Summary Since
2009, Citi has had an independent Board Chair, separate from its CEO. The Board firmly supports having an independent Director in a Board
leadership position at all times. As such, Citi’s Board, on December 15, 2009, adopted a By-law amendment which provides that if
Citi does not have an independent Chair, the Board will elect an independent Lead Director having similar duties to an independent Chair,
including leading the executive sessions of the non-management Directors at Board meetings. Citi’s Board has determined that the
current structure, an independent Chair separate from the CEO, is the most appropriate structure at this time, while ensuring that, at
all times, there will be an independent Director in a Board leadership position. Since Citi’s Board has adopted a framework that
provides for either an independent Chair or an independent Lead Director, the Board believes that this Proposal is not necessary. Important
Points to Consider Ø As
                                            required by Citi’s By-Laws, the Board elects its Chair annually, and, for each of the
                                            past 14 years, the Board has elected an independent director to serve as Board Chair. Citi’s
                                            By-Laws ensure that there will be an independent member of the Board in a leadership position
                                            at all times. Rather than formally separating the roles of CEO and Chair, it is in the best
                                            interests of Citi’s stockholders to retain flexibility to determine the optimal leadership
                                            structure at any given time, while ensuring that an independent Board member oversees the
                                            Board. The Board values the flexibility of selecting the structure of leadership best suited
                                            to meet the needs of the Company and its stockholders. Ø If
                                            the roles of Chair and CEO were combined, Citi’s Guidelines provide that the Board
                                            would designate a lead director from among the independent directors. As set forth in the
                                            Guidelines, the duties of the independent Lead Director and the non-executive chair include,
                                            but are not limited to, the following functions: ü presiding
                                            at all meetings of the Board at which the Chair is not present, including executive sessions
                                            of the independent Directors; ü serving
                                            as liaison between the Executive Chair and the independent Directors; ü approving
                                            information sent to the Board; ü approving
                                            meeting agendas for the Board; ü approving
                                            meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;
                                            and ü having
                                            the authority to call meetings of the independent Directors. Ø Citi

As previously noted, Citi has had an independent Chair since 2009.

    stockholder proposal is unnecessary given the current framework the Board has in place to ensure independent leadership for the
    Board at all times and could restrict the Board’s decision-making ability and limit the options available to the Board
    in structuring effective leadership; therefore, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this Proposal 5. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 127 Proposal
6 The
Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace, Dominican Sisters of Springfield, Good Shepherd Province Center, Maryknoll Sisters, The Nathan Cummings
Foundation, School Sisters of Notre Dame, The Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia and Sisters of the Order of St. Benedict have submitted
the following proposal for consideration at the 2024 Annual Meeting. RESOLVED Shareholders
request the Board of Directors provide a report to shareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary and confidential information,
outlining the effectiveness of Citigroup’s policies, practices, and performance indicators in respecting internationally-recognized
human rights standards for Indigenous Peoples’ rights in its existing and proposed general corporate and project financing. WHEREAS The
UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and International Labour Organization Convention 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal
Peoples in Independent Countries are internationally-recognized standards for Indigenous Peoples’ rights. 1 Violation
of these rights presents risks for Citigroup that can adversely affect shareholder value, including reputational damage, project disruptions,
and civil and criminal liability. 2 Citigroup has a history of financing projects and companies that violate Indigenous
rights, most notably as a lead financier of the Dakota Access pipeline in 2016, 3 and providing $5 billion to Enbridge
through 2021, enabling the widely opposed Enbridge Line 3 and Line 5 pipeline reroutes. 4 Indigenous
leaders from the Great Lakes tribes have called Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline reroute “an act of cultural genocide.” 5 A
2022 ruling found that Line 5 was operating illegally on Bad River Band territory since 2013. 6 Michigan’s twelve
federally recognized Tribal Nations requested President Biden to decommission Line 5 in 2021, 7 noting Enbridge’s
deceptive tactics, poor environmental track record, and risk of “catastrophic damage” to Indigenous rights. 8 Companies
like Enbridge, financed by Citigroup, consistently fail to meet the international standard of free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC)
with affected tribes. 9 Citigroup
is additionally the subject of ongoing protests for its role as a top financier of oil and gas operations in the Amazon rainforest that
pose “an existential threat” to Indigenous Peoples. 10 For example, Citigroup finances Frontera Energy, which
is connected to widespread violations of Indigenous Rights in Peru and Columbia. 11 Protests and blockades from Indigenous
communities opposing poor management of oil spills, lack of consultation, and health hazards have halted operations on numerous occasions,
even prompting Frontera to consider pulling its investments from Peru. 12 Citigroup
faces reputational risk if its “climate forward” commitments are discredited by its own financing activities. 13 Citigroup’s
human rights and risk management policies do not clearly define FPIC, nor include guidance on how Citigroup addresses companies with
track records of violating Indigenous rights. Though Citigroup adheres to the Equator Principles to manage environmental and social risk,
Indigenous experts have described them as “critically weak” and not aligned with international human rights standards. 14 Effective
policies that protect Indigenous rights are critical to managing material risk. 1 https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples.html

stockholders outlining the effectiveness of Citi’s policies, practices, and performance indicators in respecting internationally
recognized human rights standards for Indigenous Peoples. Please refer to our 2023 Proxy Statement for our concerns on misstatements made
in the stockholder proposal regarding our financing activity. 1 As part of Citi’s commitment to continually
enhance our due diligence and disclosure practices, in our 2023 ESG Report, to be released in April 2024, we plan to include a special
section on our policies and practices regarding Indigenous Peoples’ Rights to help our stakeholders better understand our approach
to respecting human rights. This statement will offer a detailed overview of our due diligence procedures, explaining how we identify
and mitigate risks related to Indigenous Peoples through different types of transactions. Our Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM)
Policy lies at the core of our strategy for addressing risks to Indigenous Peoples arising from our clients’ activities. This policy
is informed by key international environmental and social standards, such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights (“UN Guiding Principles”), the Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards. Specific “Areas of High Caution”
outlined in Citi’s ESRM Policy, including potential risks to Indigenous Peoples, necessitate special attention, heightened due diligence,
and when needed, active client engagement to assess whether a client has established appropriate policies, staffing and management systems
to mitigate sensitive risks and prevent harm. This emphasis on robust due diligence and ongoing engagement with clients underscores Citi’s
commitment to upholding the UN Guiding Principles “tenet of a business” responsibility to respect human rights, including
the rights of Indigenous Peoples. 1 See https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Citi-2023-proxy-statement.pdf, page 127. Important Points to
Consider Ø Citi has a strong record of leadership in the financial sector
regarding human rights disclosures. In 2007, Citi became the first major U.S. bank to publish a Human Rights Statement, publicly affirming
its commitment to uphold the fundamental human rights outlined in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the core conventions of
the International Labour Organization. Ø In 2016, Citi was the first U.S. bank to use the UN Guiding
Principles Reporting Framework to report on and describe our salient human rights risks, which stakeholders could be impacted by these
risks, and how these risks are incorporated as “Areas of High Caution” in our ESRM Policy to trigger additional due diligence,
including specific focus on Indigenous Peoples risks. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 129 Ø In 2018, we reinforced our commitment by updating our “Areas
of High Caution” globally in project-related financings to outline Citi’s expectations that clients will have meaningful consultations
with potentially affected Indigenous Peoples with the goal of achieving Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC). Ø In 2018, we also led an update to the Equator Principles requirements
related to FPIC for Indigenous Peoples in project-related finance, supporting improved practices across the industry. Given
    our ongoing commitment to respecting human rights, due diligence processes, and forthcoming ESG Report disclosure on Indigenous
    Peoples, which exemplify our commitment to transparency and continuous improvement, we believe that Citi is already fulfilling the
    primary concerns outlined in the Proposal; therefore the Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this Proposal 6. Proposal
7 New
York City Carpenters Pension Fund has submitted the following proposal for consideration at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Director
Election Resignation Bylaw Proposal: R ESOLVED : That the shareholders of Citigroup Inc. (“Company”) hereby
request that the board of directors take the necessary action to amend its director election resignation bylaw that requires each director
nominee to submit an irrevocable conditional resignation to the Company to be effective upon the director’s failure to receive
the required shareholder majority vote support in an uncontested election. The proposed amended resignation bylaw shall require the Board
to accept a tendered resignation absent the finding of a compelling reason or reasons to not accept the resignation. Further, if the
Board does not accept a tendered resignation and the director remains as a “holdover” director, the resignation bylaw shall
stipulate that should a “holdover” director fail to be re-elected at the next annual election of directors, that director’s
new tendered resignation will be automatically effective 30 days after the certification of the election vote. The Board shall report
the reasons for its actions to accept or reject a tendered resignation in a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. S upporting
Statement : The Proposal requests that the Board amend its director
resignation bylaw to enhance director accountability. The Company has established in its bylaws a majority vote standard for use in an
uncontested director election, an election in which the number of nominees equal the number of open board seats. Under applicable state
corporate law, a director’s term extends until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until he or she resigns or is
removed from office. Therefore, an incumbent director who fails to receive the required vote for election under a majority vote standard
continues to serve as a “holdover” director until the next meeting of shareholders. A Company resignation bylaw currently
addresses the continued status of an incumbent director who fails to be re-elected by requiring such director to tender his or her resignation
for Board consideration. The
proposed new director resignation bylaw will set a more demanding standard of review for addressing director resignations then that contained
in the Company’s current resignation bylaw. The resignation bylaw will require the reviewing directors to articulate a compelling
reason or reasons for not accepting a tendered resignation and allowing an un-elected director to continue to serve as a ““holdover”
director. Importantly, if a director’s resignation is not accepted and he or she continues as a “holdover” director
but again fails to be elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, that director’s new tendered resignation will be automatically
effective 30 days following the election vote certification. While providing the Board latitude to accept or not accept the initial resignation
of an incumbent director that fails to receive majority vote support, the amended bylaw will establish the shareholder vote as the final
word when a continuing “holdover” director is not re-elected. The Proposal’s enhancement of the director resignation
process will establish shareholder voting in director elections as a more consequential governance right. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 130 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS Management Comment Summary The amendments to
the By-Laws contemplated by the Proposal would require that, in situations where the Board finds compelling reasons not to accept a director’s
tendered resignation and the director thus continues as a “holdover” director, if such director fails to receive a majority
of the votes cast at the next annual meeting of stockholders, such director’s resignation “will be automatically effective
30 days after the certification of the election vote.” The Board
carefully considered the Director Resignation By-Law Amendment Proposal and concluded, for the reasons noted below, that a blanket
prohibition on nominating a holdover director if he or she fails to secure a majority vote would not be in the best interests of the
Company and our stockholders. In 2006, Citi adopted a majority vote standard for uncontested Director elections and amended our
By-Laws to include a director resignation requirement. The director resignation requirement provides that a nominee in an
uncontested election who is not elected by a majority vote shall offer to resign from his or her position as a Director. Unless the
Board decides to reject the offer or to postpone the effective date, the resignation becomes effective 60 days after the date of the
election. Under the By-Laws, if the Board rejects the Director’s resignation, it must publicly state its reasons for doing so.
The Board continues to believe that having a director resignation provision in its By-Laws is a best practice that ensures the
appropriate level of continuity for the Board, while giving the Board the authority to exercise its fiduciary duties in
determining whether or not to accept a holdover director’s resignation. Each member of the Board has fiduciary duties to the
Company’s stockholders, including ensuring that the Board members collectively possess skill sets that are directly relevant
to the Company’s business and strategic objectives at any given time. In meeting this responsibility, the Board must act in
the best interests of its stockholders to ensure that the Board composition is appropriate to provide oversight of Citi. Important
Points to Consider Ø Citi’s
                                            Board is committed to good governance practices, which is why our By-Laws expressly provide
                                            for a director resignation policy that permits the Board to use its collective judgment to
                                            accept or reject a holdover director’s resignation by considering the circumstances
                                            that may drive the election outcome and the potential composition of the Board if the resignation
                                            were accepted. The automatic resignation of a given director may also negatively affect Citi’s
                                            regulatory and other compliance systems, particularly a resignation that affects the composition,
                                            collective experience, and performance of our board committees. This Proposal would remove
                                            the ability of the Board to exercise its judgment and make the determination automatic, thereby
                                            limiting the decision-making authority of Citi’s Board of Directors in contravention
                                            of its fiduciary duties. The Proposal would limit the Board’s range of action on these
                                            (and other) important issues. An automatic resignation may be unnecessary and inadvisable
                                            if the directors, acting in real-time and in accordance with their fiduciary duties, determine
                                            a better alternative is available to address stockholder concerns. ü The
                                            automatic removal of a holdover director removes Board members’ ability to exercise
                                            their considered judgment in determining whether to accept such a resignation. The amendment
                                            contemplated by the Proposal is significantly restrictive, as it would provide that the director’s
                                            resignation “will be automatically effective 30 days after” a holdover director
                                            fails to receive a majority of the votes cast at the next annual meeting of stockholders.
                                            As such, the Proposal impermissibly seeks to limit the Board’s ability to assess the
                                            election and the impact of the resignation to the Board and the Company. ü The
                                            Board believes that an automatic removal of a holdover director, irrespective of any special
                                            situations that are outside of a director’s control that may have impacted the election
                                            results, could have a chilling effect on both current and future Boards and would not be
                                            in the best interests of Citi or its stockholders. Ø Citi
                                            has a very extensive Investor Engagement Program as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. To
                                            the extent our Investors wish to express dissatisfaction with a member of the Board, they
                                            have the opportunity to do so. If a Board member were to fail to receive a majority vote
                                            in an election, Citi would engage with our Investors to get a better understanding of the
                                            drivers behind the vote results and use that information to better enable the Board to make
                                            an informed decision as to whether it is appropriate to accept that director’s resignation. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 131 Ø Citi’s
                                            current director resignation requirement is consistent with market practices for large financial
                                            institutions, and Citi would be placed at a competitive disadvantage in attracting and retaining
                                            Director Nominees if the Proposal were adopted because of the automatic removal requirement
                                            of a holdover director. Because
                                            Citi has supported majority voting and has a director resignation provision in its By-Laws
                                            that are aligned with best Corporate Governance practices, the Proposal, if adopted, would
                                            put Citi’s Board at a disadvantage by preventing them from exercising their fiduciary
                                            duties in determining whether to accept a holdover director’s resignation; therefore
                                            the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this
                                            Proposal 7. Proposal 8 National Center
for Public Policy Research has submitted the following proposal for consideration at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Report to Shareholders
on Risks Created by the Company’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Efforts WHEREAS: The
US Supreme Court ruled in SFFA v. Harvard on June 29, 2023, that discriminating on the basis of race in college admissions violates
the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. 1 Attorneys
General of 13 States warned Fortune 100 companies on July 13, 2023, that SFFA implicated corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion
(DEI) programs. 2 Prior
legal advice regarding the legality of racially discriminatory programs has been called into question post- SFFA . 3 Recent
analysis of American Fortune 100 hiring in the wake of the 2020 race riots found that whites were excluded from 94% of the hiring decisions, 4 a statistic that itself provides prima
facie proof of illegal discrimination on the
basis of race by these companies, given that whites constitute 76% of the American population. 5 A
review of Citi’s website on Nov. 13, 2023, revealed the following: (1) Citi CEO Jane Fraser stating that: “I’m completely
committed to supporting our affirmative action program ….” 6 (2) “AVAILABLE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS”
listing eight career development programs that facially discriminate on the basis of race/sex/gender, with straight White males apparently
not eligible for any of these resource allocations. 7 (3) Discussion of “more than $1 billion in strategic initiatives”
apparently intended to allocate Citi resources on the basis of race in order to “help close the racial wealth gap.” 8 RESOLVED: Shareholders ask that the board commission and
publish a report on (1) whether the Company engages in any practices directly or indirectly associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion
(DEI) initiatives that may create risks of discriminating against individuals who might sue the Company (including employees, suppliers,
contractors, and retained professionals) for illegal discrimination on the basis of protected categories like race and sex, and (2) the
potential costs of such discrimination to the business. SUPPORTING
STATEMENT: In just the past year, a corporation
was successfully sued for a single case of discrimination against a white employee resulting in an award of more than $25 million. 9 The risk of being sued for such discrimination appears only to be rising. 10 With over 230,000 employees, 11 Citi likely has at least 170,000 employees who are potentially the victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white,
Asian, male, or straight. 12 Accordingly, even if only 10 percent of such employees were to file suit, and only 10 percent
of those prove successful, the cost to the company could www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 132 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS exceed $42 billion. And while racial equity audits can cost up to $4 million,
this report should cost much less, as it need review only the potentially discriminatory programs, unless Citi has established so many
such programs that its liability for this discrimination must be expected to be much higher. 1 https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/students-for-fair-admissions-inc-v-president-fellows-of-harvard-college/ 2 https://ag.ks.gov/docs/default-source/documents/corporate-racial-discrimination-multistate-letter.pdf?sfvrsn=968abc1a_2 3 https://freebeacon.com/democrats/starbucks-hired-eric-holder-to-conduct-a-civil-rights-audit-the-policies-he-blessed-got-the-coffee-maker-sued/ 4 https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-black-lives-matter-equal-opportunity-corporate-diversity/

that Citi’s Board “commission and publish a report on (1) whether the Company engages in any practices directly or indirectly
associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that may create risks of discriminating against individuals who might
sue the Company (including employees, suppliers, contractors, and retained professionals) for illegal discrimination on the basis of
protected categories like race and sex, and (2) the potential costs of such discrimination to the business.” The Proposal asserts
that certain of Citi’s DEI programs result in illegal racial discrimination, pointing to, for example, Citi’s career development
programs that allegedly “facially discriminate on the basis of race/sex/gender, with straight White males apparently not eligible
for any of these resource allocations” and Citi’s investment of more than $1 billion in strategic initiatives that are “apparently
intended to allocate Citi resources on the basis of race in order to ‘help close the racial wealth gap.” The Supporting
Statement further claims that Citi’s DEI programs could result in significant legal liability from employees “who are potentially
the victims of … illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male, or straight.” Citi disagrees with
the Proposal’s assertion that its diversity, equity and inclusion programs are unlawful. Citi has a long-standing commitment to
following equal employment opportunity principles and to complying with the full range of laws regarding fair employment practices and
non-discrimination. Citi fully understands its obligation to provide equal employment opportunities and to not engage in unlawful
conduct in establishing and implementing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Citi continues to review and refine those policies
and practices in light of the evolving legal landscape and business needs. The proponent mischaracterizes
Citi’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion by suggesting that its diversity, equity and inclusion programs are unlawful.
Citi’s policies are designed to emphasize that our personnel are expected to respect the beliefs, identity and values of others.
Citi prohibits discrimination and harassment against its employees in all forms, regardless of whether or not individual protections
are legally mandated in the countries Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 133 and communities where it operates. Any unlawful discriminatory treatment based on a protected characteristic
is prohibited at Citi, and that principle, in addition to the legal requirements outlined above, guides Citi’s design and implementation
of diversity, equity and inclusion policies and practices. In addition, Citi’s
Code of Conduct clearly states that Citi does not “tolerate discrimination, harassment, retaliation, or intimidation of any kind
that breaches our policies or is unlawful, whether committed by or against a manager, co-worker, client, supplier, or visitor and whether
it occurs while at work, at work-related events, or outside of work” and requires its personnel to: Ø “Respect
                                            the personal beliefs, cultures, identity, and values of every individual. Listen and be respectful
                                            of different backgrounds and points of view.” Ø “Never
                                            treat someone differently based on that person’s race (including personal appearance
                                            and hair), sex, gender, pregnancy, gender identity or expression, color, creed, religion,
                                            national origin, nationality, citizenship, age, physical or mental disability or medical
                                            condition as defined under applicable law, genetic information, marital status (including
                                            domestic partnerships and civil unions as defined and recognized by applicable law), sexual
                                            orientation, culture, ancestry, familial or caregiver status, nursing status, military status,
                                            veteran’s status, socioeconomic status, unemployment.” Ø “Provide
                                            fair and equitable access to goods, products, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,
                                            or accommodations and make decisions regarding their provision based on objective criteria.” Important
Points to Consider Ø Adoption
                                            of the proposal is not necessary because Citi is obligated by law to not engage in unlawful
                                            conduct in establishing and implementing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Ø Citi
                                            has clearly articulated its firm commitment to non-discrimination, which extends to all employees,
                                            clients, customers and other stakeholders, and that commitment underlies all of its diversity,
                                            equity and inclusion initiatives. Ø The
                                            Board already provides oversight of Citi’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies
                                            and practices, including related legal and regulatory compliance risks. In addition to oversight
                                            by the full Board, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee of the Board oversees
                                            Citi’s ESG activity, including reviewing its policies and programs for human rights
                                            and diversity matters, among other things. Ø The
                                            proposal requests a report and quantification of alleged discrimination risk and potential
                                            cost to the business; however, Citi already in the ordinary course evaluates litigation risks
                                            across the company, and it would not be in the best interests of Citi and its stockholders
                                            to produce the additional report that the proposal requests. The
    stockholder proposal is not necessary as Citi is legally required to maintain its commitment to non-discriminatory practices, including
    with respect to its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and the Board already oversees potential risks of discrimination
    associated with Citi’s diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; therefore, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this Proposal 8. Proposal 9 American Family
Association has submitted the following proposal for consideration at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Report on Risks
of Politicized De-banking S UPPORTING S TATEMENT : Financial institutions
are essential pillars of the marketplace. Because of their importance in America’s economy, many federal and state laws prohibit
them from discriminating against customers. The UN Declaration of Human Rights recognizes that “everyone has the right to freedom
of thought, conscience, and religion.” 1 These guarantees are an important part of protecting every American’s
freedom of speech and free exercise of religion. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 134 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS As shareholders of Citigroup, we believe the company must provide financial services
on an equal basis without regard to factors such as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or social, political, or religious views. We
are concerned with recent evidence of religious and political discrimination against customers by companies in the financial services
industry, as seen in recent examples 2 and the 2022 Statement on Debanking and Free Speech. 3 Citigroup’s charitable
giving policy 4 excludes religious organizations. As noted in the 2023 Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index 5 ,
“charitable giving policies [ought not] bar nonprofits from receiving support simply because of their religious status.” As
per the 1792 Exchange’s report 6 , which lists the Corporation as ‘High Risk’, Citigroup “does not protect
its employees from viewpoint discrimination.” This lack of protection raises serious concerns over the possibility of politicized
debanking which Citigroup shareholders have a right to have assuaged. In
the 2023 Viewpoint Diversity Index, 7 Citigroup maintains a score of 0 (out of 100) in its respect for viewpoint diversity
in the public square. In the workplace, Citigroup scores 12, with the report noting that “no publicly accessible policy affirms
a minimum degree of respect for freedom of religion and viewpoint diversity in the workforce.” This lack of respect for viewpoint
diversity can snowball into concerns over debanking of politically inconvenient clients. In
early 2023, shareholders called for Chase, Mastercard, PayPal, Capital One, and Charles Schwab to assess whether they have adequate safeguards
to prevent politicized de-banking. 8 Nineteen state attorneys general and fourteen state financial officers specifically called
out Chase for their de-banking of a non-profit committed to advancing religious freedom and demanded action from the company to address
such widespread concerns. 9 The Index notes
that Citigroup “did not respond” to a request for increased transparency in the Company’s procedures regarding “restricting
services or content.” In absence of clearer protocols, Citigroup could be the next corporation to run such reputational risk. Value for shareholders
must take priority over activist demands. R ESOLVED: Shareholders request that Citigroup’s
Board of Directors conduct an evaluation and issue a report within the next year, at reasonable cost and excluding proprietary information
and disclosure of anything that would constitute an admission of pending litigation, evaluating how it oversees risks related to discrimination
against individuals based on their race, color, religion (including religious views), sex, national origin, or political views, and whether
such discrimination may impact individuals’ exercise of their constitutionally protected civil rights. 1 https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights. 2 https://adflegal.org/press-release/bank-america-boots-charity-serving-impoverished-ugandans-under-vague-risk-tolerance; https://www.newsweek.com/stop-troubling-trend-politically-motivated-debanking-opinion-1787639; https://www.dailymail.

that “Citigroup’s Board of Directors conduct an evaluation and issue a report within the next year, ... evaluating how it
oversees risks related to discrimination against individuals based on their race, color, religion (including religious views), sex, national
origin or political views, and whether such discrimination may impact individuals exercise of constitutionally protected civil rights.”
The Supporting Statement outlines the proponents’ assertion that Citi “must provide financial services on an equal basis
without regard to factors such as race, color, religion, sex national origin, or social, political or religious views” and highlights
the need for clear protocols to protect against reputation risk in this area. Among other things, the statement cites to a third-party
report alleging that Citi does not adequately protect its employees from viewpoint discrimination. The proponents conclude that such
a “failure” supports a conclusion that Citi could engage in politicized de-banking with respect to its clients. The statement
also cites to a report that incorrectly states that Citigroup does not have a “publicly accessible policy [that] affirms a minimum
degree of respect for freedom of religion and viewpoint diversity of its workforce.” Citi agrees
that it has an obligation to provide financial services in a non-discriminatory manner but disagrees with the statements that it has
failed to adopt—or disclose—appropriate policies demonstrating its commitment to conducting its business in a
non-discriminatory manner both with respect to its clients and its own workforce. Through disclosure of its Code of Conduct, and
other reports including the Proxy Statement, Citi has already appropriately disclosed how it prohibits unlawful discrimination
against individuals based on race, color, religion (including religious views), sex, national origin or political views, as well as
how it protects employee viewpoint expression. For example, the Environmental, Social and Governance Report explains that
Citi’s Global Financial Access Policy “establishes the guiding principles and minimum standards for fair, equitable and
nondiscriminatory access to the goods, products, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations that Citi provides
to customers and clients.” Similarly, the Citi Foundation does not unlawfully discriminate against religious organizations,
and religious organizations are eligible for funding for projects that are aligned with the Foundation’s mission. The Board oversees risks related to discrimination through reporting it receives on Citi’s human capital management practices,
Citi’s Code of Conduct, and its reporting on human capital management in its various public disclosures. Citi strives to
earn and maintain the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical standards as outlined in Citi’s Code of
Conduct, which is reviewed and approved by the Board. Citi’s commitment to non-discrimination extends to all employees, clients,
customers, and stakeholders. The Code of Conduct clearly states that Citi does not “tolerate discrimination, harassment, retaliation,
or intimidation of any kind that breaches our policies or is unlawful, whether committed by or against a manager, co-worker, client,
supplier, or visitor and whether it occurs while at work, at work-related events, or outside of work” and requires its personnel
to: Ø “Respect
                                            the personal beliefs, cultures, identity, and values of every individual. Listen and be respectful
                                            of different backgrounds and points of view.” www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 136 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS Ø “Never
                                            treat someone differently based on that person’s race (including personal appearance

                                            or accommodations and make decisions regarding their provision based on objective criteria.” With
respect to its own workforce, the Code further encourages employees to “create a collaborative work environment where different
points of view can be raised and are respected and all team members are encouraged to contribute, develop, and fully use their talents
and their voice.” These obligations are reinforced through annual Code of Conduct Training and implemented through internal policies
and procedures. Important
Points to Consider Ø Adoption
                                            of the proposal would not be in the best interests of Citi’s stockholders because Citi
                                            has already clearly articulated its firm commitment to non-discrimination, which extends
                                            to all employees, clients, customers, and stakeholders. Ø To
                                            support its efforts in this area, Citi maintains a Code of Conduct outlining the standards
                                            of ethics and professional behavior expected of employees and representatives of Citi when
                                            dealing with clients, business colleagues, stockholders, communities, and each other, as
                                            well as numerous other internal policies and procedures to promote non-discriminatory practices
                                            across its business operations and engagements with clients and suppliers. The
                                            stockholder proposal is not necessary as Citi has already articulated its commitment to non-discriminatory
                                            practices and disclosed how it manages those risks through policies and training; therefore,
                                            the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this
                                            Proposal 9. Proposal 10 Harrington Investments, Inc. has submitted the following proposal
for consideration at the 2024 Annual Meeting. WHEREAS: Animal
welfare issues present material financial, operational, and reputational risks for companies that receive financing from our
Company, and to Citigroup as their financier. The risks of mismanaging animal welfare include business disruption
or loss of goodwill associated with inhumane treatment of animals such as animal testing and conditions of habitation, but they also may
include environmental impacts of factory farming and related supply chain risks, and potential liabilities associated with issues of food
safety, including diseases passed from animals to humans and overuse of antibiotics in livestock. 1 OpenInvest published an analysis of these issues: “A
company that does not disclose or prioritize its processes or impact on animal welfare raises questions for investors on how effective
that company can be in managing potential risks or opportunities down the road. It is also impossible to assess future risk without the
disclosure of the right information.” 2 To minimize these risks, some banks are taking animal welfare
issues into account as part of their lending due diligence practices. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 137 However, Citi’s oversight on animal welfare is miniscule,
at best. Citi’s Environmental and Social Policy Framework discusses due diligence regarding financing that potentially impacts critical
habitat and areas of high conservation value 3 , and “traceability” in beef supply chains. However, this due diligence
is limited to “areas of high caution” and “sensitive ecoregions”, failing to address the welfare of
animals involved. 4 Consideration for biodiversity and habitat loss in sensitive ecoregions does not equate
to consideration for animal welfare. Further, “animal welfare” is never mentioned in any
of Citi’s reports, policies, or governance documents. Though peers like Wells Fargo & Goldman Sachs perform abysmally
regarding animal welfare, Citi performs even worse with a score of “ 0 ”, according to the Banks for Animals scorecard.
Goldman notes financing to plant-based companies, and Wells Fargo has Sustainable Finance Eligibility criteria, whereas Citi does not
and is seemingly lacking oversight in numerous key areas relating to animal welfare, including but not limited to “Animal Farming and Food Production” and “Animal
Testing”. 5 Alternatively, banks like Triodos and de Volksbank established
specific exclusionary criteria to reduce exposure to animal cruelty and its associated risks. 6,7 Simply because a process is not disclosed, does not necessarily
indicate a lack of due diligence. However, neglecting to publicly acknowledge oversight on animal welfare risks the perception of our
company’s failure of oversight on critical issues. Publicly asserting how Citigroup addresses the issue of animal welfare when considering
financing decisions would not only increase transparency but enhance Citi’s overall reputation. Resolved : Shareholders
request that Citigroup publish a report at reasonable expense and excluding proprietary and privileged information, disclosing
whether and how the Board of Directors exercises its oversight regarding material risks associated with animal welfare. 1 https://www.openinvest.com/articles-insights/support-animal-welfare 2 New Animal Welfare Cause: How to Avoid Future Risk and Hold Businesses Accountable, Published on May 12, 2021. https://www.openinvest.com/articles-insights/support-animal-welfare 3 https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Environmental-and-Social-Policy-Framework.pdf 4 https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Global-ESG-Report-2022.pdf 5 https://banksforanimals.org/institutions/citigroup/ 6 https://www.triodos.com/en/articles/2022/triodos-bank-updates-minimum-standards 7 https://static.devolksbank.nl/files/Guide-ASN-Sustainability-Criteria-2022.pdf?v=1683199950 Management Comment Summary The proposal requests that Citi publish a report disclosing whether
and how the Board of Directors exercises its oversight regarding material risks associated with animal welfare. The Supporting Statement
expresses a concern that “animal welfare issues present material financial, operational, and reputational risks for companies that
receive financing from our Company, and to Citigroup as their financier.” Citi’s Board of Directors provides oversight of Citi’s
work to identify, assess and integrate sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Moreover, our internal risk management processes
are designed to help us understand a broad array of key risks associated with our activities and with our clients. Citi’s Enterprise
Risk Management (ERM) Framework details the principles used to support consistent risk management across the organization. Risks related
to animal welfare, such as threats to biodiversity and flora and fauna, have been incorporated in our Environmental and Social Risk Management
(ESRM) Policy when relevant from a risk management perspective. Separately, a number of our clients in certain sectors have
voluntarily committed to good practices related to animal welfare, such as the “Five Freedoms” of animal welfare. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 138 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS Important Points to Consider Ø ESRM:
Under Citi’s ESRM Policy, there are certain Areas of High Caution, such as risks to biodiversity, that require special attention, focus and
respect. In addition, Citi’s ESRM Policy includes prohibitions on doing business with companies when our due diligence indicates
that they are active in production or trade in wildlife or products regulated under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), or drift net fishing in the marine environment using nets in excess of 2.5 km in length. Ø Illegal
Wildlife Trafficking: Citi is a member of United for Wildlife’s Financial Taskforce, a collaboration between financial institutions
and nongovernmental organizations established to fight illegal wildlife trafficking. In 2022, Citi worked through the United for Wildlife
Hong Kong chapter in support of legislation that elevates wildlife-related trafficking to a serious crime and helped develop a financial
sector toolkit and threat profile for the region. In 2023, Citi expanded its active participation in the taskforce and joined the United
for Wildlife regional chapters in East Africa; Middle East and North Africa; North America; and Hong Kong. Ø Sustainable
Finance: Citi’s sustainable finance activity includes sustainable agriculture and land use, such as work with clients in the agricultural
tech space and focused on alternative proteins. We provide detailed annual reporting on our sustainable finance activity, by product,
environmental/social criteria, and region. As one example of a sustainable finance transaction related to biodiversity, in 2022, Citi
supported the World Bank in issuing a $150 million first-of-its-kind, outcome-based Wildlife Conservation Bond that contributes to protecting
and increasing black rhino populations in two protected park areas in South Africa, by providing conservation investment payments to
the parks in lieu of coupon payments to investors. Citi
    believes that the stockholder proposal is not necessary in light of the Board’s existing oversight of Citi’s risk
    framework and policies, including pursuant to Citi’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework that drives board reporting on
    risk and related disclosures; therefore, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this Proposal 10. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 139 Submission of Future Stockholder Proposals Under SEC Rule 14a-8, a stockholder who intends to present a proposal
at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders and who wishes the proposal to be included in the Proxy Statement for that meeting must submit
the proposal in writing to the Corporate Secretary of Citi at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013 and send to the following
email address: shareholderrelations@citi.com. Proposals for the 2025 Annual Meeting must be received no later than November 19, 2024.
The proposal and its proponent must satisfy all applicable requirements of Rule 14a-8. Citi’s By- l aws
permit a stockholder or group of stockholders (up to 20) who have owned at least 3% of Citi common stock for at least three years to
submit Director nominees (up to the greater of two nominees or 20% of the Board, as determined in accordance with the By- l aws)
for inclusion in Citi’s Proxy Statement if the nominating stockholder(s) satisfies the requirements specified in the By- l aws.
With respect to stockholder nominees for Director election submitted for inclusion in Citi’s Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual
Meeting, written notice of nominations must be provided by the stockholder proponent(s) to Citi in accordance with Citi’s By- l aws.
The notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received by, Citi’s Corporate Secretary not earlier than October 20, 2024 and
not later than November 19, 2024. These deadlines are based on the 150th day and 120th day, respectively, before the one-year anniversary
of the date that the Proxy Statement for this Annual Meeting was first sent to stockholders (which date, for purposes of Citi’s
By- l aws, is March 19, 2024). The ability to include a nominee in Citi’s Proxy
Statement is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Citi’s By- l aws. With respect to stockholder nominees for Director election at
the next Annual Meeting (other than nominees submitted for inclusion in Citi’s proxy materials) and stockholder proposals for consideration
at the next Annual Meeting that are not submitted for inclusion in Citi’s proxy materials under Rule 14a-8, written notice of nominations
and proposals must be provided by the stockholder proponent to Citi in accordance with Citi’s By- l aws
(which includes information required under Rule 14a-19). The notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received by, Citi’s Corporate
Secretary, not earlier than December 31, 2024 and not later than January 30, 2025 and must comply with all applicable provisions
of Citi’s By- l aws. You may obtain a copy of Citi’s By- l aws
on Citi’s website or by writing to Brent J. McIntosh, Corporate Secretary, at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013 or
to the following email address: shareholderrelations@citi.com. Cost of Annual Meeting and Proxy Solicitation Citi pays the cost of the Annual Meeting and the cost of soliciting
proxies. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Citi may solicit proxies by personal interview, telephone, and similar means. No Director,
officer, or employee of Citi will be specially compensated for these activities. Citi also intends to request that brokers, banks, and
other nominees solicit proxies from their principals and will pay the brokers, banks, and other nominees certain expenses they
incur for such activities. Citi has retained Morrow Sodali LLC, a proxy soliciting firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies, for an estimated fee of $30,000 plus reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses. Householding Under SEC rules, a single set of Annual Reports and
Proxy Statements or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, as applicable, may be sent to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they appear to be members of the same
family. Each stockholder continues to receive a separate proxy card. This procedure, referred to as householding, reduces the volume
of duplicate information stockholders receive and reduces mailing and printing expenses. In accordance with a notice sent to certain
stockholders who shared a single address, only one Annual Report and Proxy Statement or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, as applicable, will be sent to that address unless any
stockholder at that address requested multiple sets of documents be sent. However, if any stockholder who agreed to householding
wishes to receive a separate Annual Report or Proxy Statement, he or she may telephone toll-free 1-866-540-7095 or write to
Broadridge Financial Services, Inc., Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Stockholders sharing an address
who wish to receive a single set of reports may do so by contacting their banks or brokers, if they are beneficial holders, or by
contacting Broadridge at the address set forth above, if they are record holders. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 140 About the 2024 Annual Meeting Q: Who is soliciting my vote?

Q: Why did I receive a one-page Notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials this year instead of a full set of proxy materials? A: Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we have elected to mail to many of our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials. All stockholders receiving the Notice will have the ability to access the proxy materials over the Internet and receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail on request. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, the Notice contains instructions on how you may access proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically on an ongoing basis. This process has allowed us to expedite our stockholders’ receipt of proxy materials, lower the costs of distribution, and reduce the environmental impact of our 2024 Annual Meeting. Q: Why didn’t I receive a Notice in the mail about the Internet availability of the proxy materials? A: We are providing some of our stockholders, including stockholders who have previously asked to receive paper copies of the proxy materials and some of our stockholders who are living outside of the United States, with paper copies of the proxy materials instead of a Notice. In addition, we are providing a Notice by email to those stockholders who have previously elected delivery of the proxy materials electronically. Those stockholders should have received an email containing a link to the website where those materials are available and a link to the proxy voting website. Q: How can I access Citi’s proxy materials and Annual Report electronically? A: This Proxy Statement and the 2023 Annual Report are available
    on Citi’s website at www.citigroup.com. Click on “Investors,” then “Corporate Governance.” Most stockholders
    can elect not to receive paper copies of future Proxy Statements and Annual Reports and can instead view those documents on the Internet.
    Information on or connected to our website (or the website of any third party) referenced in this Proxy Statement is in addition to and
    not a part of or incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement. If you are a stockholder of record, you can choose this option
    and save Citi the cost of producing and mailing these documents by following the instructions provided when you vote over the Internet.

    for instructions on how to elect not to receive paper copies of future Proxy Statements and Annual Reports. If you choose not to receive paper copies of future Proxy Statements
    and Annual Reports, you will receive an email message next year containing the Internet address to use to access Citi’s Proxy Statement
    and Annual Report. Your choice will remain in effect until you tell us otherwise or until your consent is deemed to be revoked under applicable

    member is permitted to vote your shares in the same proportion as all other shares are voted with respect to this proposal, and (ii) all

selection of KPMG as the independent registered public accounting firm of Citi for 2024. If stockholders
do not ratify the selection of KPMG, the Audit Committee will evaluate the stockholder vote when
considering the selection of an independent registered public accounting firm for the audit engagement
for the 2025 fiscal year. Q: Is my vote confidential? A: In 2006, the Board adopted a confidential voting policy as part
    of its Corporate Governance Guidelines. Under the policy, except as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements or as otherwise described
    below, all votes, whether submitted by proxies, ballots, Internet voting, telephone voting, or otherwise are kept confidential for registered
    stockholders who request confidential treatment. If you are a registered stockholder and would like your vote kept confidential, please
    check the appropriate box on the proxy card or follow the instructions when submitting your vote by telephone, mobile phone, QR Code or
    by Internet. If you hold your shares in “street name” or through an employee benefit plan or stock incentive plan, your vote
    already receives confidential treatment and you do not need to request confidential treatment in order to maintain the confidentiality
    of your vote. The confidential voting policy will not apply in the event of
    a proxy contest or other solicitation based on an opposition Proxy Statement and in certain other limited circumstances. For further details
    regarding this policy, please see the Corporate Governance Guidelines, available on Citi’s website at www.citigroup.com. Q: Could other matters be decided at the 2024 Annual Meeting? A: We don’t know of any matters that will be considered at the Annual Meeting other than those described above. If a stockholder proposal that was excluded from this Proxy Statement is brought before the meeting, the Chair will declare such proposal out of order, and it will be disregarded, or we will vote the proxies AGAINST the proposal. If any other matters arise at the Annual Meeting that are properly presented at the meeting, the proxies will be voted at the discretion of the proxy holders. Q: What happens if the meeting is postponed or adjourned or encounters technical difficulties? A: Your proxy will still be good and may be voted at the postponed or adjourned meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until it is voted.

                                                                            issued under the Plan as set forth in Section 6(a). In addition, shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company on the open market
                                                                            or otherwise using cash proceeds from the exercise of Options shall not be added to the maximum number of shares that may be issued
                                                                            under the Plan as set forth in Section 6(a). (c) Other Items not Included in Share Limit. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan as set forth in
Section 6(a) shall not be affected by (i) the payment in cash of dividends or dividend equivalents in connection with outstanding Awards;
or (ii) the grant of Substitute Awards. Any shares purchased by or on behalf of Participants in a dividend reinvestment program established
under the Plan shall not count against the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan as set forth in Section 6(a), provided
that such shares are purchased in open-market transactions or are treasury shares purchased directly from the Company at Fair Market Value
at the time of purchase. (d) Adjustments. In the event of any change in the Company’s capital structure, including but not limited to a change
in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, on account of (i) any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, spinoff or
any similar equity restructuring, or (ii) any combination or exchange of equity securities, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization,
or divesture or any other similar event affecting the Company’s capital structure, or (iii) any change to the capital structure
or event affecting the capitalization of the Company, to reflect such change in the Company’s capital structure, the Committee shall
make appropriate equitable adjustments to (i) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan as set forth
in Section 6(a), and (ii) the maximum number of shares that may be granted to any single individual pursuant to the limits set forth in
Section 5(d). In the event of any extraordinary dividend, divestiture, or other distribution (other than ordinary cash dividends) of assets
to stockholders, or any transaction or event described above or in the applicable Award Agreement, to the extent necessary to prevent
the enlargement or diminution of the rights of Participants, the Committee shall make appropriate equitable adjustments to the number
or kind of shares subject to an outstanding Award, the exercise price applicable to an outstanding Award. The Company shall give each
Participant notice of an adjustment to an Award hereunder, and any determination by the Committee under this Section 6(d) shall be deemed
made pursuant to its authority under Section 4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall decline to adjust any Award made
to a Participant if such adjustment would violate applicable law. 7. Awards Under the Plan Awards under the Plan may be granted as Options, SARs,
or Stock Awards, as described below. Awards may be granted singly, in combination, or in tandem as determined by the Committee. Subject
to the terms of the Plan (including but not limited to the minimum vesting requirement of Section 7(d)), Awards shall have such terms,
conditions, limitations, and restrictions as may be determined by the Committee from time to time, and may include vesting, forfeiture,
cancellation and clawback provisions as may be required by applicable laws, rules or regulations or any applicable securities exchange
listing standards or as may be imposed in accordance with Company policies or practices, in either case as may be in effect from time
to time. (a) Options. Options shall expire after such period, not to exceed 10 years, as may be determined by the Committee. If an
Option is exercisable in installments, such installments or portions thereof that become exercisable shall remain exercisable until the
Option expires or is otherwise cancelled pursuant to its terms or the terms of the Plan. In no event shall any Option issued under the
Plan be a “reload” Option or carry any similar rights. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ANNEX
B 157 (i) Exercise Price. The Committee shall determine the exercise price per share for each Option, which shall not be less than
100% of the Fair Market Value on the grant date, unless the Option is a Substitute Award. (ii) Exercise of Options. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions relating to vesting and exercisability, as determined
by the Committee, and upon provision for the payment in full of the exercise price and applicable taxes due, the Participant shall be
entitled to exercise the Option and receive the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in connection with the Option exercise. The
shares issued in connection with the Option exercise may be subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Committee may determine,
from time to time. An Option may be exercised by any method as may be permitted by the Committee from time to time, including but not
limited to any “net exercise” or other “cashless” exercise method. (b) Stock Appreciation Rights. SARs granted under the Plan shall expire after such term, not to exceed 10 years, as may be
determined by the Committee. The exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to a SAR shall not be less than 100% of Fair Market
Value on the grant date, unless the SAR is a Substitute Award. (c) Stock Awards (i) Stock Payment. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may grant vested shares of Common Stock as a Stock Payment.
A Stock Payment may be in lieu of cash compensation, but may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer, or cancellation and recoupment,
as determined by the Committee. A Stock Payment under the Plan may be granted as, or in payment of, a bonus determined pursuant to any
other plan. Any shares of Common Stock granted as a Stock Payment in lieu of cash compensation shall be valued at their Fair Market Value. (ii) Restricted Stock. Upon satisfaction of all conditions to vesting and any tax withholding obligations, and upon the lapse
of any post-vesting restrictions on sale or transfer, shares of Common Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Award shall be delivered to
a Participant free of restriction. (iii) Deferred Stock. A Deferred Stock Award represents only an unfunded, unsecured promise to deliver shares of Common Stock
in the future and does not give a Participant any greater rights than those of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. Upon satisfaction
of all conditions to vesting and any tax withholding obligations, shares of Common Stock subject to a vested Deferred Stock Award will
be issued, and upon the lapse of any post-vesting restrictions on sale or transfer, such shares of Common Stock will be delivered to a
Participant free of restriction. (iv) Other Stock-Based Awards. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the Committee may grant any other Award that
is denominated in shares of Common Stock and that may be settled in cash and/ or by the delivery of shares of Common Stock (for the avoidance
of doubt, an award that by its terms may be settled only in cash shall not be an Award under this Plan). (d) Minimum Vesting Requirement. Notwithstanding any
other provision of the Plan to the contrary, Awards granted under the Plan shall vest no earlier than the first anniversary of the date
on which the Award is granted; provided, that the following Awards shall not be subject to the foregoing minimum vesting requirement:
any (i) Substitute Awards, (ii) Awards to Directors that vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and the
next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year’s annual meeting, (iii) shares
of Common Stock delivered in lieu of fully vested cash obligations, and (iv) any additional Awards the Committee may grant, up to a maximum
of five percent (5%) of the available share reserve authorized for issuance under the Plan pursuant to Section 6(a) (subject to adjustment
under Section 6(d)); and, provided, further, that the foregoing restriction does not apply to the Committee’s discretion to provide
for accelerated exercisability or vesting of any Award, including in cases of retirement, death, disability, leave of absence, termination
of employment, Change in Control, upon the sale or other disposition of a Participant’s employer, or any other similar event, as
specified in the Award Agreement. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 158 ANNEX B (e) Performance-Based Awards (i) The Committee may grant Awards that are subject to the achievement of one or more Performance Conditions related to a period of performance
of not less than one year. (ii) Performance Conditions may be expressed in either, or a combination of, absolute or relative values or a percentage of: revenue, revenue
or product growth, net income (pre- or after-tax), earnings, earnings per share, stockholders’ equity or return on stockholders’
equity, assets or return on assets, return on risk-adjusted assets, capital or return on capital, return on risk capital, return on tangible
common equity, book value or book value per share, tangible book value per share, economic value-added models or equivalent metrics, operating
income, pre- or after-tax income, expenses or reengineering savings, margins, cash flow or cash flow per share, stock price, total shareholder
return, market share, debt reduction, net promoter scores, operating efficiency ratios, expense ratios, liquidity ratios, regulatory achievements
or any objective or subjective Performance Conditions selected by the Committee. In addition, such Performance Conditions may be used
on an absolute or relative basis to measure the performance of the Company as a whole, any business unit(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and/or one or more of its branches or affiliates, or the performance of an individual Participant, and may be used in any combination
as the Committee may deem appropriate. Such Performance Conditions may also be based on performance determined on a per share basis (either
basic or fully diluted) and/or as compared to the performance of a group of peer or comparator companies, prior performance periods, a
published or special index or indices that the Committee deems appropriate, or such other measures selected or defined by the Committee
at the time such Performance Conditions are established. (iii) Subject to Section 11, to the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of the rights of Participants, the Committee
shall make appropriate equitable adjustments to any Performance Condition, including (but not limited to) with respect to items determined
to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence, or that are related to discontinued operations, the disposal of
a business or assets, or a change in accounting principle under GAAP, or that are attributable to the business operations of any entity
acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary during a relevant performance period; (f) Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any fractional shares of Common Stock in settlement of
Awards granted under the Plan. If an Award includes or results in an entitlement to a fractional share for any reason, the Award shall
be settled in full by issuance of the maximum whole number of shares of Common Stock the Participant is entitled to receive pursuant to
the terms of the Award (upon satisfaction of all applicable conditions to the issuance of shares) and the Company may cancel the fractional
share without any compensation to the Participant. 8. Dividends and Dividend Equivalents The Committee may provide that Stock Awards shall
earn dividends or dividend equivalents. Such dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid currently or may be credited to an account
maintained on the books of the Company. Any payment or crediting of dividends or dividend equivalents will be subject to such terms, conditions,
limitations, and restrictions as the Committee may establish, from time to time, including, without limitation, reinvestment in additional
shares of Common Stock or common share equivalents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may not provide for the current payment
of dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to any shares of Common Stock subject to an Award with a Performance Condition; for
such Awards, the Committee may only provide for the accrual of dividends or dividend equivalents that will not be payable to a Participant
unless and until, and only to the extent that, the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award vest upon satisfaction of the relevant
Performance Condition and all other applicable conditions to vesting. Dividend or dividend equivalent rights shall be as specified in
the Award Agreement, or pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Committee with respect to outstanding Awards. No dividends or dividend
equivalents shall be paid on Options or SARs. Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ANNEX
B 159 9. Voting Unless the Committee has determined otherwise, a Participant
shall have the right to direct the vote of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock subject to continuing restrictions pursuant to
the terms of a Stock Award under the Plan. All such shares shall be voted by the Plan Administrator in accordance with instructions received
from Participants (unless to do so would constitute a violation of any applicable exchange rules). Any such shares as to which no instructions
are received shall be voted by the Plan Administrator proportionately in accordance with instructions received with respect to all other
such shares and with respect to shares underlying awards granted pursuant to a Prior Plan that are also subject to continuing restrictions. 10. Nontransferability Awards granted under the Plan, and during any period
of restriction on transferability, shares of Common Stock issued in connection with the exercise of an Option or a SAR, or vesting of
a Stock Award, may not be sold, pledged, hypothecated, assigned, margined, or otherwise transferred by a Participant in any manner other
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless and until the shares underlying such Award have been issued, and all restrictions
applicable to such shares have lapsed or have been waived by the Committee. No Award or interest or right therein shall be subject to
the debts, contracts, or engagements of a Participant or his or her successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer,
alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment, or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or
by operation of law, by judgment, lien, levy, attachment, garnishment, or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy
and divorce), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void, of no effect, and not binding on the Company in any way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may permit
Options and/or shares issued in connection with an Option or a SAR exercise that are subject to restrictions on transferability to be
transferred one time and without payment or consideration to a member of a Participant’s immediate family or to a trust or similar
vehicle for the benefit of a Participant’s immediate family members. During the lifetime of a Participant, all rights with respect
to Awards shall be exercisable only by such Participant or, if applicable pursuant to the preceding sentence, a permitted transferee. 11. Change of Control of the Company (a) The Committee may, at the time an Award is made or at any time prior to or coincident with a Change of Control: (i) provide for the adjustment of any Performance Conditions as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to prevent the enlargement
or diminution of the rights of the Participants; (ii) provide for the cancellation of any Awards then outstanding if the surviving entity or acquiring entity (or the surviving or
acquiring entity’s parent company) in the Change of Control replaces the Awards with new rights of substantially equivalent value; (iii) provide that upon an involuntary termination of a Participant’s employment as a result of a Change of Control, any time periods
shall accelerate, and any other conditions relating to the vesting, exercise, payment, or distribution of an Award shall be waived; or (iv) provide that Awards shall be purchased for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have been obtained for the shares covered
by a Stock Award if it had been vested or by an Option or SAR if it had been exercised at the time of the Change of Control. (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, the vesting, payment, purchase, or distribution
of an Award may not be accelerated by reason of a Change of Control for any Participant unless the Participant’s employment is involuntarily
terminated as a result of the Change of Control. For purposes of this Section 11, a Participant’s employment will be deemed to have
been involuntarily terminated as a result of a Change of Control if it is involuntarily terminated other than for Cause at any time beginning
on the date of the Change of Control up to and including the first anniversary of the Change of Control. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 160 ANNEX B (c) A “Change of Control” shall be deemed to occur if and when: (i) any person, including a “person” as such term is used in Section 14(d)(2) of the 1934 Act (a “Person”), is
or becomes a beneficial owner (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the 1934 Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the
Company representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities; (ii) individuals who, as of the Effective Date, constitute the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to constitute
at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the Effective Date whose election,
or nomination for election by the Company’s stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising
the Incumbent Board, shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding for this purpose
any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of either an actual or threatened election contest (as such
terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies
or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; (iii) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are sold, transferred, or distributed, or the Company is dissolved or liquidated;
or (iv) a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other corporate transaction involving the Company (a “Transaction”) is
consummated, in each case, with respect to which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such Transaction do not, immediately
after the Transaction, own more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction
in substantially the same respective proportions as such stockholders’ ownership of the voting power of the Company immediately
before such Transaction. 12. Award Agreements Each Award
under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement (as such may be amended from time to time) that sets forth the terms,
conditions, restrictions, and limitations applicable to the Award, including, but not limited to, the provisions governing vesting,
exercisability, payment, forfeiture, cancellation, and termination of employment, all or some of which may be incorporated by
reference into one or more other documents delivered or otherwise made available to a Participant in connection with an Award. The
Committee need not require the formal execution or acceptance of such document by the Participant, in which case acceptance of any
benefit of the Award by the Participant shall constitute agreement by the Participant to the terms, conditions, restrictions, and
limitations set forth in the Plan and the Award Agreement as well as the administrative guidelines and practices of the Company in
effect from time to time. Any assertion by an Employee that any term, condition, limitation, or restriction of the Award as
specified in the Award Agreement is invalid or not binding on such Employee because of his or her non-acceptance of the Award
Agreement (or any portion thereof) shall be deemed a refusal of the Award and the Employee shall cease to be a Participant with
respect to the Award, which shall be immediately cancelled. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or of an Award Agreement to
the contrary, each Award shall be subject to the Company’s mandatory clawback policy issued and established pursuant to
Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable exchange listing standards (to the extent the Participant is subject to that
policy). 13. Tax Withholding Participants shall be solely responsible for any applicable
taxes (including without limitation income, payroll, and excise taxes) and penalties, and any interest that accrues thereon, which they
incur under applicable law in connection with the receipt, vesting, or exercise of any Award. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall have
the right to require payment of, or may deduct from any payment made under the Plan or otherwise to a Participant, or may permit or require
shares to be tendered or sold (including shares of Common Stock delivered or vested in connection with an Award) in any method so specified
and in an amount sufficient to cover withholding of, any federal, state, local, foreign, or other governmental taxes or charges required
by law, or hypothetical taxes required to be paid by a Participant pursuant to a tax-equalization policy for expatriate employees, and
to take such other Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ANNEX
B 161 action as may be necessary to satisfy any such withholding
or payment obligations. The value of any shares allowed to be withheld or tendered for tax withholding may not exceed the amount allowed
consistent with fixed plan accounting in accordance with GAAP, to the extent applicable. To the extent that a number of shares of Common
Stock sufficient to satisfy a tax withholding obligation of the Company may not be withheld (whether because the Award has not vested
in full pursuant to its terms, administrative procedures in effect at such time, applicable accounting principles, or any other reason),
the Company shall have the right to condition the obligation of the Company to issue shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an Option
or a SAR, or in settlement of any vested Award, on the Participant paying to the Company, on demand, such amount as may be requested by
the Company for the purpose of satisfying any actual tax withholding (or hypothetical tax) liability. If the amount is not timely paid
to the Company in cash by such Participant, the Company may cancel the Award and refuse to issue such shares. 14. Repayment Obligations and Right of Set-Off (a) If the Committee determines that all conditions to vesting and payment or distribution of an Award (or any portion thereof), or the
vesting and exercisability of an Option or SAR (or any portion thereof), were not satisfied in full on the scheduled vesting date (including
but not limited to, any Performance Condition), the Committee shall cancel such vesting and refuse to issue or distribute shares or cash
and immediately terminate the Participant’s rights with respect to such Award (or improperly vested portion thereof). If any such
Award (or portion thereof) has already been paid, distributed, or exercised, the Participant shall be obligated, upon demand, to: (i)
in the case of an improperly vested Stock Award, return the amount of any cash payment received in settlement of the Stock Award (or improperly
vested portion thereof), or if settled in shares, the number of shares of Common Stock issued in settlement of the Stock Award (or improperly
vested portion thereof), or make a cash payment in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such shares on their vesting date, if greater
than their Fair Market Value on the date they are due to be returned to the Company; or (ii) in the case of an improperly exercised
Option or SAR, make a cash payment in an amount equal to the gain realized upon exercise of such Option or SAR (or improperly vested or
exercised portion thereof), in each case, without reduction for any shares of Common Stock or cash withheld or paid to satisfy withholding,
actual or hypothetical tax obligations in connection with such Awards or any other obligation of the Participant. (b) To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, and consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, if applicable, the
Company will have the right: (x) to offset against its obligation to deliver vested shares of Common Stock or make any vested cash payment
pursuant to any Award granted under the Plan: (i) any amounts paid by the Company or a Subsidiary to a third party pursuant to any award,
judgment, or settlement of a complaint, arbitration, or lawsuit of which a Participant was the subject; and (ii) any outstanding amounts
(including, without limitation, travel and entertainment or advance account balances, loans, clawback or other repayment obligations under
any Awards granted under the Plan, or awards granted under any other plan, or any obligations pursuant to a tax-equalization or housing
allowance policy or other expatriate benefit) that a Participant then owes to the Company or a Subsidiary; and (y) if Participant recovers
any amount in the nature of severance pay or compensation for hypothetical or potential future services in connection with any legal claim
or action alleging violation of law relating to Participant’s employment or termination thereof, whether by reason of a decision
or settlement of such claim, reduce the amount to be paid in connection with the settlement of the Award following the termination of
Participant’s employment, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the pre-tax amount required to be paid for the Participant’s account
(including legal fees) in connection with such claim or action. The Company may not retain any funds or securities described herein, or
set-off obligations or liabilities described above, until such time as such funds or securities would otherwise be distributable or payable
to Participant in accordance with the applicable award terms. Only after-tax amounts will be applied to set-off any such obligations and
liabilities and Participant will remain liable to pay any amounts that are not thereby satisfied in full. 15. Other Benefit and Compensation Programs Awards granted under the Plan and amounts received
upon vesting or exercise of an Award shall not be deemed a part of a Participant’s regular, recurring compensation for purposes
of calculating payments or benefits under any Company benefit plan or severance program unless specifically provided for under the plan or program.
Unless www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 162 ANNEX B specifically set forth in an Award Agreement, Awards under the Plan are not intended as payment for compensation that otherwise
would have been delivered in cash, and even if so intended, such Awards shall be subject to such vesting requirements and other terms,
conditions, restrictions, and limitations as may be provided in the Award Agreement. 16. Unfunded Plan Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the
Plan shall be unfunded and shall not create (or be construed to create) a trust or a separate fund or funds. The Plan shall not establish
any fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or other person. To the extent that any Participant holds any rights
by virtue of an Award granted under the Plan, such rights shall constitute general unsecured liabilities of the Company and shall not
confer upon any Participant or any other person or entity any right, title, or interest in any assets of the Company. 17. Expenses of the Plan The expenses of the administration of the Plan shall
be borne by the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company may require Subsidiaries to pay for the Common Stock issued under the Plan to
Participants employed (or formerly employed) by such Subsidiaries. 18. Rights as a Stockholder Unless the Committee determines otherwise, a Participant
shall not have any rights as a stockholder with respect to shares of Common Stock covered by an Award until the date the Participant becomes
the holder of record with respect to such shares. No adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is
prior to such date, except as provided in Section 6(d) or Section 8. 19. Future Rights No Employee shall have any claim or right to be granted
an Award under the Plan. There shall be no obligation of uniformity of treatment of Employees under the Plan. Further, the Company and
its Subsidiaries may adopt other compensation programs, plans, or arrangements as they deem appropriate or necessary. The adoption of
the Plan or the granting of any Award shall not confer upon any Employee any right to continued employment in any particular position
or at any particular rate of compensation, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate
the employment of its Employees at any time, free from any claim or liability under the Plan. Unless expressly provided otherwise elsewhere
in the Plan or in an Award Agreement, Awards under the Plan shall be made in anticipation of future service and/or subject to other vesting
conditions and will not be earned until all conditions to vesting have been satisfied. 20. Amendment and Termination The Plan may
be amended, suspended, or terminated at any time by the Committee, provided that no amendment shall be made without stockholder approval,
if it would (a) materially increase the number of shares available under the Plan (other than pursuant to Section 6(d)), (b) materially
expand the types of awards available under the Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan,
(d) materially extend the term of the Plan, (e) materially change the method of determining the exercise price of an Award, (f) delete
or limit the Plan’s prohibition against Repricing, or (g) otherwise require approval by the stockholders of the Company in order
to comply with applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (or, if the Common Stock is not traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, the principal national securities exchange upon which the Common Stock is then traded or quoted). No such amendment referred
to above shall be effective unless and until it has been approved by the stockholders of the Company. The Committee retains the right
to modify an Award without a Participant’s prior consent if it determines that the modification is required to comply with applicable
law, regulation, or regulatory guidance Citi 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ANNEX
B 163 (including applicable tax law). Except as may be provided
by Section 7(e), Section 11, and this Section 20, any other adverse modification shall not be effective without the Participant’s
written consent. The Company shall furnish or make available to Participants a written notice of any modification through a brochure,
prospectus supplement, or otherwise, which notice shall specify the effective date of such modification. 21. Successors and Assigns The Plan and any applicable Award Agreement entered
into under the Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted assigns of Participants,
including, without limitation, the executors, administrators, or trustees of a Participant’s estate, or any receiver or trustee
in bankruptcy or representative of a Participant’s creditors. 22. Governing Law The Plan and all Award Agreements entered into under
the Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York, except that any principles or provisions
of New York law that would apply the law of another jurisdiction (other than applicable provisions of U.S. federal law) shall be disregarded.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, matters with respect to indemnification, delegation of authority under the Plan, and the legality of shares
of Common Stock issued under the Plan, shall be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 23. Tax Compliance Awards granted hereunder shall comply with or be exempt
from Section 409A of the Code, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. If, pursuant to any Award that is subject to Section 409A
of the Code, a Participant is entitled to receive a payment on a specified date, such payment shall be deemed made as of such specified
date if it is made (a) not earlier than 30 days before such specified date, and (b) not later than December 31 of the year in which such
specified date occurs or, if later, the fifteenth day of the third month following such specified date; provided that the Participant
shall not be permitted, directly or indirectly, to designate the taxable year in which such payment is made. If, pursuant to any Award
that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, a Participant is entitled to a series of installment payments, such Participant’s right
to the series of installment payments shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments and not as a right to a single payment.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “series of installment payments” has the same meaning as provided in Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)
of the regulations promulgated under the Code. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in no event shall the Company
or any Subsidiary be liable to a Participant on account of an Award’s failure to (a) qualify for favorable U.S. or foreign tax treatment,
or (b) avoid adverse tax treatment under U.S. or foreign law, including, without limitation, Sections 409A and 457A of the Code. 24. Severability If any provision of this Plan is finally held to be
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable (whether in whole or in part), such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability, and the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby; provided that,
if any such provision is finally held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable because it exceeds the maximum scope determined to be acceptable
to permit such provision to be enforceable, such provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary in order to make such
provision enforceable. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents 164 This page intentionally left blank. Table of Contents 165 This page intentionally left blank.
