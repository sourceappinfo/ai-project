YOU ARE URGED TO VOTE YOUR PROXY PROMPTLY BY MAIL, TELEPHONE OR VIA THE INTERNET, WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE ANNUAL MEETING. 1 Table of Contents ABOUT THE MEETING Who Can Vote Record holders of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Cavco at the close of business on May 27, 2013 may vote at the annual meeting. On that date, the issued and outstanding capital stock of Cavco entitled to vote at the annual meeting consisted of 6,967,954 shares of common stock. Each stockholder will be entitled to one vote per share on the election of directors and each other matter that is described above or that may be properly brought before the meeting. There are no cumulative voting rights. How You Can Vote Stockholders can vote their shares of common stock at the annual meeting by voting and submitting the accompanying proxy by telephone, over the Internet, or by completing, signing, dating and returning the proxy in the enclosed envelope. How Proxies Will be Voted Shares represented by valid proxies received by telephone, over the Internet or by mail will be voted at the annual meeting in accordance with the directions given. If no specific choice is indicated, the shares represented by all valid proxies received will be voted: (i) FOR the election of the nominee for director named in the proxy; (ii) FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Cavco’s independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2014; (iii) FOR approval of the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers; and (iv) FOR the approval of the issuance of the Shares. In the event you specify a different choice by means of the enclosed proxy, your shares will be voted in accordance with those instructions. Our Board does not intend to present, and has no information that others will present, any business at the annual meeting other than as is set forth in the attached notice of the meeting. However, if other matters requiring the vote of stockholders come before the annual meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy intend to vote the proxies held by them in accordance with their best judgment in such matters. How to Revoke Your Proxy You have the unconditional right to revoke your proxy at any time prior to the voting thereof by submitting a later-dated proxy, by attending the annual meeting and voting in person, or by written notice to Cavco addressed to James P. Glew, Secretary, Cavco Industries, Inc., 1001 N. Central Avenue, Suite 800, Phoenix, Arizona 85004. No such revocation will be effective, however, unless received by us at or prior to the annual meeting. Attending the meeting without voting in person does not revoke your proxy. Quorum and Required Vote The presence at the annual meeting, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote at the meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for the purpose of establishing a quorum. With respect to Proposal No. 1 (Election of Directors), in order to be elected as a director, a nominee must receive the affirmative votes of the holders of a plurality of the shares of common stock present, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the election of directors. The director-nominee receiving the highest number of votes will be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on Proposal No. 1. 2 Table of Contents The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes duly cast is required to approve Proposal No. 2 (Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditors); Proposal No. 3 (Advisory Vote on the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers) and Proposal No. 4 (Approval of issuance of the Shares). Abstention and broker non-votes are not treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on Proposal Nos. 2, 3 and 4. The advisory vote on the compensation of named executive officers is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the named executive officers and the compensation philosophy, policies and procedures described in this proxy statement. With respect to Proposal No. 3, because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board or the Company.  However, the Board will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. Please note that your broker is not able to vote on your behalf in any director election without specific voting instructions from you. In addition, your broker is not able to vote on your behalf on Proposal No. 3. Accordingly, we encourage you to vote your shares before the meeting either by returning your proxy by mail, voting by telephone or voting via the Internet so that your shares will be represented and voted at the meeting if you cannot attend in person. If sufficient votes for approval of the matters to be considered at the annual meeting have not been received prior to the meeting date, we may postpone or adjourn the annual meeting in order to solicit additional votes. The form of proxy being solicited by this proxy statement provides the authority for the proxy holders, in their discretion, to vote the stockholders’ shares with respect to a postponement or adjournment of the annual meeting. At any postponed or adjourned meeting, proxies received pursuant to this proxy statement will be voted in the same manner described in this proxy statement with respect to the original meeting. Expenses of Soliciting Proxies We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies for the annual meeting. Solicitation may be made by mail, personal interview, telephone or other electronic means by our officers and other employees, who will receive no additional compensation therefor. The Stock Purchase The Company has entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with the Sellers pursuant to which we will acquire the Fleetwood Shares (the “Stock Purchase”). The Company currently already owns 50% of the outstanding shares of Fleetwood so following the closing of the Stock Purchase the Company will own 100% of the outstanding shares of Fleetwood. A copy of the Stock Purchase Agreement is attached to this proxy statement at Annex A. Consideration for the Stock Purchase Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company will issue up to approximately 2,031,193 shares of the Company’s common stock in consideration for the Fleetwood Shares, which will represent up to approximately 22.6% of our common stock following the issuance. For a further discussion of the consideration payable to acquire the issued and outstanding shares of Fleetwood, see “The Stock Purchase — Stock Purchase Consideration” on page 36. Reason stockholder approval is necessary for the issuance of the Shares Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company expects to issue up to approximately 2,013,193 shares of the Company’s common stock, which equates to 29.15% of the Company’s 6,967,954 shares of common stock issued and outstanding on May 27, 2013. The Company’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Pursuant to NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5635(a), the issuance of our common stock in connection with the Stock Purchase requires the approval of the Company’s stockholders because the issuance will exceed 20% of the number of shares of Company common stock outstanding prior to the issuance. 3 Table of Contents SUMMARY TERM SHEET This summary highlights only selected information from this proxy statement and may not contain all of the information that is important to you.

The factors that our Board relied upon to approve the Stock Purchase and to recommend stockholder approval are described in more detail under the heading “The Stock Purchase — Our Reasons for the Stock Purchase” beginning on page 35 and “The Stock Purchase — Recommendation of our Board” beginning on page 36. Vote Required to Approve the Issuance of the Shares Pursuant to NASDAQ Marketplace Rule (the “NASDAQ Rules”) 5635(a), the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast on the matter at the annual meeting is required to approve the issuance of the Shares. Conditions to Closing of the Stock Purchase (see page 38) Certain conditions must be satisfied or waived before the Company and the Sellers are obligated to complete the Stock Purchase. Termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement Under Specified Circumstances (see page 39) Under circumstances specified in the Stock Purchase Agreement, either party may terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement and as a result, the Stock Purchase would not be completed. U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Stock Purchase No gain or loss will be recognized by us or by holders of shares of our common stock as a result of the Stock Purchase. Anticipated Accounting Treatment We will account for the Stock Purchase as an equity transaction under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The results of operations of Fleetwood have already been consolidated with the Company’s financial statements and will continue to be consolidated after the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Reasons for the Stock Purchase (See page 35) The Company and Sellers are parties to the Shareholders’ Agreement as amended which is more fully described in the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 12, 2012 and June 11, 2013 (the “Shareholders’ Agreement”), that includes put and call rights relating to the Sellers’ 50% ownership interest in Fleetwood. The terms of the proposed transaction in the Stock Purchase Agreement represent an independently negotiated transaction, as the conditions for the put or call right to become exercisable have not been met as of the date of this proxy statement. The reasons for entering into the Stock Purchase Agreement include, among other things, (i) immediate accretion to earnings, (ii) accretion to book value, (iii) an increase in stockholders' equity by approximately $92.0 million; and (iv) the solidification and simplification of the Company’s traditional conservative capital structure, accounting processes and administration. For a description of the other factors considered by our Board in determining to recommend approval of the Stock Purchase, see “The Stock Purchase — Our Reasons for the Stock Purchase” beginning on page 35. 5 Table of Contents Regulatory Approvals Under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (“HSR Act”) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Stock Purchase may not be consummated until required information and materials have been furnished to the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and certain waiting period requirements have expired or been terminated.  At any time before the closing of the transaction, the DOJ, the FTC or others could take action under the antitrust laws with respect to the acquisition . Restrictions on the Shares All of the shares of our common stock issued in the Stock Purchase will be “restricted securities” and may not be sold absent registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or pursuant to Rule 144 or another available exemption from registration. We have agreed to use our best efforts to file a registration statement to register the resale of these shares following the closing of the Stock Purchase. Expected Date to complete the Stock Purchase Subject to satisfaction or waiver of all conditions, including approval of the issuance of the Shares at the Annual Meeting, we expect to complete the Stock Purchase no later than August 31, 2013. However, because the Stock Purchase is subject to a number of conditions, we cannot predict exactly when the closing of the Stock Purchase will occur or if it will occur at all. For a description of the conditions to completion of the Stock Purchase, see “The Stock Purchase Agreement — Conditions to Closing of the Stock Purchase” beginning on page 38. 6 Table of Contents COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA DATA Financial information for Fleetwood is included in Cavco’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”). The Company had previously determined that, under GAAP, although Fleetwood is only fifty-percent owned by the Company, Cavco has a controlling interest and is required to fully consolidate the results of Fleetwood. The primary factors that contributed to this determination were Cavco’s management and board control of Fleetwood wherein members of Cavco’s management hold all of the seats on the board of directors of Fleetwood. In addition, pursuant to a management services agreement among the Fleetwood shareholders, Cavco provides all executive-level management services to Fleetwood including, among other things, general management oversight, marketing and customer relations, accounting and cash management. The Sellers’ financial interest in Fleetwood is considered a “redeemable noncontrolling interest,” and is designated as such in Cavco’s consolidated financial statements upon completion of the Stock Purchase. We will account for the Stock Purchase as an equity transaction under GAAP. The results of operations of Fleetwood have already been consolidated with the Company’s financial statements and will continue to be consolidated after the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement. The redeemable noncontrolling interest held by the Sellers will be eliminated and converted to stockholders' equity upon completion of the Stock Purchase. The following unaudited pro forma data at March 30, 2013 is presented on a basis to reflect the Stock Purchase as if it had occurred on April 1, 2012. You should read this unaudited pro forma data together with Cavco’s historical audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three years ended March 30, 2013 and their accompanying notes and management’s discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition included in Cavco’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 11, 2013. These historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending March 29, 2014, or in any future period. Cavco’s historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the pro forma financial statements to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the Stock Purchase; and (2) factually supportable. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that management believes reasonably reflect the business combination.

RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, you should carefully consider the material risks described below in deciding whether to vote for approval of the proposals presented in this proxy statement. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are not currently believed to be material, if they occur, also may adversely affect the Company following the Stock Purchase. For risks related to the Company, please see the Company’s Form 10−K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2013, which is incorporated by reference herein. Risks Related to the Stock Purchase We will issue a large number of shares of common stock in connection with the Stock Purchase, which will result in substantial ownership dilution to our existing stockholders. Our stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Stock Purchase commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Stock Purchase. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company will issue up to approximately 2,031,193 shares of the Company’s common stock in consideration for the Fleetwood Shares, which will represent up to approximately 22.6% of our common stock following the issuance. If we are unable to realize the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Stock Purchase, our stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interest without receiving commensurate benefit. If the conditions to the closing of the Stock Purchase are not met, the Stock Purchase will not occur, which could adversely impact the market price of our common stock as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specified conditions must be satisfied or waived before the Stock Purchase can be completed, including, without limitation, obtaining the requisite approval of our stockholders with respect to our proposed issuance of the Shares. These conditions are summarized in the section in this proxy statement entitled “The Stock Purchase Agreement — Conditions to Closing of the Stock Purchase” beginning on page 38 and are described in detail in the Stock Purchase Agreement attached to this proxy statement at Annex A. We cannot assure you that each of the conditions will be satisfied. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived in a timely manner and the Stock Purchase is delayed, we may lose some or all of the intended or perceived benefits of the transaction, which could cause our stock price to decline and harm our business. If the transaction is not completed for any reason, our stock price may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Stock Purchase will be completed. In addition, we will be required to pay our costs related to the transaction even if the Stock Purchase is not completed, such as amounts payable to legal counsel and independent accountants, and such costs are significant. All of these costs will be incurred whether or not the transaction is completed. The Stock Purchase may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the Stock Purchase. The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Stock Purchase for a number of reasons including if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Stock Purchase as rapidly or to the extent anticipated; the effect of the Stock Purchase on our business and prospects is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or investors react negatively to the effect on our business and prospects from the Stock Purchase. 10 Table of Contents Subject to certain limitations, the Sellers may sell up to fifteen percent of the Shares during the lock-up period and beginning on the day following the one year anniversary of the closing of the Stock Purchase may sell any number of shares, subject to the standstill provisions, which could (i) cause our stock price to decline; and (ii) limit or delay the Company’s ability to utilize income tax benefits from its net operating loss carryforwards. The sale of a substantial number of our shares by the Sellers or our other stockholders within a short period of time could cause our stock price to decline, make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock or acquire other businesses using our common stock as consideration. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD−LOOKING STATEMENTS This proxy statement includes “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In general, all statements included or incorporated in this proxy statement that are not historical in nature are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are often characterized by the use of words such as “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “may,” “will,” “intends,” “plans,” or “anticipates,” or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements are typically included, for example, in discussions regarding the manufactured housing and site-built housing industries; our financial performance and operating results; and the expected effect of certain risks and uncertainties on our business, the Stock Purchase, financial condition and results of operations, economic conditions and consumer confidence, our operational and legal risks, how we may be affected by governmental regulations and legal proceedings, the expected effect of certain risks and uncertainties on our business, the availability of favorable consumer and wholesale manufactured home financing, market interest rates and our investments, and the ultimate outcome of our commitments and contingencies. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. As a result, our actual results or performance may differ materially from anticipated results or performance. Also, forward-looking statements are based upon management's estimates of fair values and of future costs, using currently available information. Therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in those statements. Factors that could cause such differences to occur include, but are not limited to, those discussed under “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in this proxy statement. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this proxy statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For all of these reasons, you should not place any reliance on any such forward-looking statements included in this Proxy Statement. 11 Table of Contents STOCK OWNERSHIP Management The following table sets forth information, as of June 1, 2013, with respect to the beneficial ownership of shares of Cavco common stock by each director, director nominee and executive officer named in the Summary Compensation Table under “Executive Compensation,” individually itemized, and by all directors, director nominees and executive officers of Cavco as a group.

Upon commencement of service, non-employee directors receive a one-time grant of an option to purchase 10,000 shares of Cavco common stock. Effective April 1, 2012, annually, non-employee directors receive annual compensation in the form of a $30,000 retainer fee, a grant of an option to purchase 4,000 shares of Cavco common stock on the anniversary of the director’s election to the Board, and an additional $2,000 for each Board meeting attended. Members of Board committees also receive a fee of $1,000 for each committee meeting attended. The chairperson of the Audit Committee receives an additional $10,000 per year for such service and the chairperson of the Compensation Committee receives an additional $4,000 per year for such service. All Board members are reimbursed for reasonable expenses of attending Board and committee meetings. All options awarded to non-employee directors have a seven-year term and a per share exercise price equal to the fair market value of a share of common stock of Cavco on the date of grant. All options awarded prior to April 1, 2010, become exercisable at the rate of 25% on the date of grant and an additional 25% on the following three anniversaries of the date of grant. Options awarded on or after April 1, 2010, become exercisable at the rate of 50% on the date of grant and 50% on the first anniversary of the date of grant. All rights to exercise the options terminate within four months of the date that the non-employee director ceases to be a director of Cavco for any reason other than death or disability; in the case of a director’s death, the options terminate fifteen months thereafter and in the case of disability and resulting termination of the directorship, then the options terminate six months after such date of termination. However, if the non-employee director held the position for at least ten years, the options will vest on the date that the non-employee director ceases to be a director and all rights to exercise the options will terminate three years thereafter, but in no event may the options be exercised later than seven years from the date of grant. 16 Table of Contents DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE The following table provides information regarding compensation paid to each non-employee director during the year ended March 30, 2013.

Greenblatt $50,000 $67,200 $117,200 Jack Hanna $42,000 $67,400 $109,400 (1) Amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). We describe the assumptions made in these valuations in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Cavco’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended March 30, 2013 (the “2013 Form 10-K”). Board and Committee Meetings During Cavco’s fiscal year ended March 30, 2013, the Board of Directors held five meetings, the Audit Committee met six times and the Compensation Committee met three times. Each director attended at least 85% of the aggregate of the Board and committee meetings of which they were a member. All Board members are expected to attend our annual meetings of stockholders, unless an emergency or unavoidable conflict prevents them from doing so. All directors, with the exception of Steven G. Bunger, attended our 2012 annual meeting, which was held on July 11, 2012. Mr. Bunger was excused from attending the 2012 annual meeting by the Chairman because of an unavoidable conflict. Director Nominating Process Selection by Independent Directors. The Board has not established a director nominating committee. Instead, our Board has determined that the independent directors, as a group, should fulfill this responsibility. The Board has adopted resolutions, as required by the NASDAQ Rules, providing for the nomination of directors by the independent directors of the Board, which the Board believes promotes flexibility and ensures that each of our independent directors has a meaningful role in the selection of our director nominees. Generally, director nominees are identified and screened by all independent directors. For any nominee to be placed on Cavco’s ballot for voting by Cavco’s stockholders at any meeting of stockholders of Cavco, such nominee must first be approved by a majority of the independent directors of Cavco, and by a majority of the entire Board. The Board may form a nominating committee in the future at such time as the Board determines that a committee structure is necessary or useful in the director nominating process. Director Qualifications . The independent directors evaluate potential director nominees according to the following criteria: • decisions for nominating candidates are based on the business and corporate governance needs of Cavco and if the need for a director exists, then candidates are evaluated on the basis of merit, qualifications, performance and competency; 17 Table of Contents • the independent directors consider the composition of the entire Board when evaluating individual directors, including the diversity of experience and background represented by the Board; the need for financial, business, academic, public or other expertise on the Board and its committees; and the desire for directors working cooperatively to represent the best interests of Cavco, its stockholders and employees, and not any particular constituency; • a majority of our Board must be comprised of “independent” directors in accordance with applicable NASDAQ Rules; • we seek directors with the highest personal and professional character and integrity who have outstanding records of accomplishment in diverse fields of endeavor, and who have obtained leadership positions in their chosen business or profession; • candidates must be willing and able to devote the necessary time to discharge their duties as a director, and should have the desire to represent and evaluate the interests of Cavco as a whole; • candidates must be free of conflicts of interest that would interfere with their ability to discharge their duties as a director or that would violate any applicable law or regulation; and • candidates must also meet any other criteria as determined by the independent directors, which may differ from time to time. Diversity. Cavco does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, but the Board strives to nominate directors with a variety of complementary skills so that, as a group, the Board will possess the appropriate talent, skills, and expertise to oversee Cavco's businesses. Proposals by Stockholders. Our bylaws specify the manner in which stockholders may: • make nominations for the election of directors; • propose that a director be removed; or • propose any other business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders. Under our bylaws, in order to bring a proposal before a meeting of stockholders, a stockholder must deliver timely notice of a proposal pertaining to a proper subject for presentation at the meeting to our corporate secretary along with, among other specified information, the following: • a description of the business or nomination to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting; • the stockholder’s name and address; • the number of shares beneficially owned by the stockholder; • the names and addresses of all persons with whom the stockholder is acting in concert and a description of all arrangements or understandings with such persons; and • the number of shares beneficially owned by each person with whom the stockholder is acting in concert. To be timely, a stockholder must deliver notice: • in connection with an annual meeting of stockholders, not less than 90 nor more than 180 days prior to the date on which the immediately preceding year’s annual meeting of stockholders was held; • in connection with a special meeting of stockholders to elect directors, not less than 40 nor more than 60 days prior to the date of the special meeting; or 18 Table of Contents • in connection with a special meeting of stockholders for purposes other than the election of directors, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the date of the special meeting. In order to submit a nomination for our Board, a stockholder must also submit information with respect to the nominee that would be required to be included in a proxy statement, as well as other specified information. If a stockholder fails to follow the required procedures, the stockholder’s nominee or proposal will be ineligible for election or other action and will not be voted on by our stockholders. Other Board Matters Board Leadership Structure The Board does not have a policy regarding the separation of the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board as the Board believes it is in the best interests of Cavco to make that determination based on the position and direction of Cavco and the membership of the Board. The Board has determined that having Cavco's Chief Executive Officer serve as Chairman is in the best interest of Cavco’s stockholders at this time. This structure makes the best use of the Chief Executive Officer's extensive knowledge of Cavco and its industry, as well as fostering greater communication between Cavco's management and the Board. Cavco does not have a lead independent director. The Board’s Role in Risk Oversight Management of risk is the responsibility of Cavco’s executive officers and senior management team. The Board has oversight responsibility and has designated the Audit Committee to oversee Cavco’s processes to manage business and financial risk and compliance with significant applicable legal, ethical, and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee reports to the Board regarding the adequacy of Cavco's risk management processes. To assist the Audit Committee in overseeing risk management, Cavco’s Director of Internal Audit is directly accessible by the Audit Committee and reports to the Audit Committee upon request. Additionally, the Board encourages management to promote a corporate culture that incorporates risk management into Cavco's corporate strategy and day-to-day business operations. The Board regularly works, with the input of Cavco's executive officers, to assess and analyze the most likely areas of future risk for Cavco. Communicating With Our Board You can communicate with any member of our Board by sending the communication to Cavco Industries, Inc., 1001 N. Central Avenue, Suite 800, Phoenix, Arizona 85004, to the attention of the director or directors of your choice.  We relay these communications addressed in this manner as appropriate. Communications addressed to the attention of “The Board of Directors” are forwarded to the chairperson of our Audit Committee for review and further handling. Audit Committee Our Audit Committee is composed of three directors, Messrs. Boor, Bunger, and Greenblatt, who satisfy the independence requirements set forth in (1) Section 10A(m) of the Exchange Act and the rules adopted by the SEC thereunder and (1) applicable NASDAQ Rules. The Audit Committee functions under a charter, which was initially adopted by our Board on September 22, 2003, and was most recently amended on September 27, 2012. The Audit Committee Charter is posted on our website at www.cavco.com. The Board has determined that William C. Boor, the Chairperson of the Audit Committee, meets the definition of “Audit Committee financial expert,” as such term is defined under SEC rules. Mr. Boor’s qualifications are described in his biography on page 15. The Audit Committee Charter provides that the Audit Committee shall perform the following key tasks: • select, appoint, evaluate, retain, terminate and replace Cavco’s independent auditors (subject, if the Audit Committee so determines, to stockholder ratification); 19 Table of Contents • obtain and review, at least annually, a report by Cavco’s independent auditors describing the firm’s internal quality-control procedures, any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the preceding five years, respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm, and any steps taken to deal with such issues; • receive the applicable written independence disclosures required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including those disclosures required by Ethics and Independence Rule 3526 (the “Independence Report”); • actively engage in a dialogue with the independent auditors with respect to any relationships or services disclosed in the Independence Report or otherwise known to the Audit Committee that may impact the objectivity or independence of the auditor, and recommend that the Board take appropriate action in response to such information to satisfy itself of the auditor’s independence; • review any report made by Cavco’s independent auditors pursuant to Section 10A(k) of the Exchange Act; • confirm with the independent auditor that the independent auditor is in compliance with the partner rotation requirements established by the SEC; • review with the independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and management’s response; and • preapprove all auditing services, audit engagement fees and terms and permitted non-audit services provided to Cavco by its independent auditors (subject to the de minimis exceptions for certain non-audit services set forth in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act), provided that the Audit Committee may delegate to one or more subcommittees the authority to grant approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services. The Audit Committee also reviews Cavco’s corporate compliance program. The Audit Committee meets separately with the independent auditors, outside the presence of Cavco’s management or other employees, to discuss matters of concern, to receive recommendations or suggestions for change and to exchange relevant views and information. AUDIT FEES The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures pre-approving all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by Ernst & Young LLP. Under these policies, the Audit Committee pre-approves the use of audit and specific permissible audit-related and non-audit services up to certain dollar limits. Services that do not come under this authority must be pre-approved separately by the Audit Committee. In determining whether or not to pre-approve services, the Audit Committee determines whether the service is a permissible service under the SEC’s rules and, if permissible, the potential effect of such services on the independence of Ernst & Young LLP. The aggregate fees billed for professional services by Ernst & Young LLP in the last two fiscal years are reported in the following table. Type of Fees Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Audit Fees $ 1,135,510 $ 1,059,681 Audit-Related Fees — 313,334 Tax Fees 342,150 114,000 All Other Fees 1,995 1,995 Total $ 1,479,655 $ 1,489,010 20 Table of Contents As used in the foregoing table: • “Audit Fees” are the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of Consolidated Financial Statements included in Cavco’s Form 10-K, internal controls, and review of Consolidated Financial Statements included in Cavco’s Form 10‑Q quarterly reports or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements; • “Audit-Related Fees” are the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for assurance and related services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including accounting consultations, due diligence related to business combinations, internal control reviews, and attest services that are not required by statute or regulation; • “Tax Fees” are the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years fees for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning; and • “All Other Fees” includes the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the principal accountant for permitted corporate finance assistance and permitted advisory services. Report of the Audit Committee In accordance with its written charter, the primary function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of: (i) the quality and integrity of Cavco Industries Inc.’s (“Cavco”) accounting, auditing, and financial reporting practices and processes; (ii) the financial information to be provided to the stockholders of Cavco; (iii) the systems of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting established by management, the Committee and the Board; (iv) compliance with Cavco’s Code of Conduct; (v) the independent auditors’ qualifications and independence; (vi) the performance of Cavco’s independent auditors; and (vii) the internal audit process. Management is responsible for Cavco’s financial reporting process, including the system of internal controls, and for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The independent accountants are responsible for auditing and rendering an opinion on Cavco’s consolidated financial statements, as well as auditing certain aspects of Cavco’s internal controls. The Audit Committee’s responsibility is to monitor these processes. 21 Table of Contents In discharging its duties, the Audit Committee has: (i) reviewed and discussed Cavco’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 30, 2013 with our management; (ii) discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees ; (iii) received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence; (iv) discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm such independent registered public accounting firm’s independence; and (v) discussed with management critical accounting policies and the processes and controls related to the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer financial reporting certifications required by the SEC and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to accompany Cavco’s periodic filings with the SEC. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, we recommend to the Board of Directors that the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above be included in Cavco’s Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended March 30, 2013. Audit Committee of the Board of Directors William C. Boor, Chairperson Steven G. Bunger David A. Greenblatt PROPOSAL NO. 2: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR Ernst & Young LLP acted as Cavco’s independent registered public accounting firm to audit its books and records for fiscal year 2013, and the Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as Cavco’s independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2014, subject to ratification by Cavco stockholders. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain Ernst & Young LLP, but still may retain them. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Cavco and our stockholders. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from Cavco stockholders. Recommendation of the Board The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Cavco’s independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2014. 22 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Introduction The purpose of this compensation discussion and analysis (“CD&A”) is to provide information about each material element of compensation that we pay or award to, or that is earned by, our named executive officers. For fiscal year 2013, our named executive officers were Joseph H. Stegmayer, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Daniel L. Urness, our Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Charles E. Lott, President of Fleetwood Homes; and Larry H. Keener, former President of Palm Harbor Homes. Overview Our executive compensation program for our named executive officers is relatively uncomplicated, consisting of cash compensation comprised of base salary and either a cash bonus or non-equity incentive compensation, as well as awards of options to purchase shares of our common stock or grants of restricted stock. Generally, we do not offer perquisites to our named executive officers. We do not have a defined benefit pension plan or any other similar retirement plan; however, our named executive officers are permitted to participate in Cavco’s 401(k) plan and other health and welfare programs that are generally available to all other full-time employees. Compensation Committee Our Compensation Committee of our Board (“Compensation Committee”) reviews and approves, or recommends to the Board for approval, all salary and other remuneration for our executive officers and oversees matters relating to our employee compensation and benefit programs. Stockholder Approval of our Compensation Decisions At the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Cavco’s stockholders approved the advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation with approximately 89% of the votes cast in favor of the proposal regarding the Company’s executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee considers this vote a validation of its approach to executive compensation and generally has continued its compensation processes and philosophy in making 2013 executive compensation decisions, with the exception of Mr. Stegmayer’s compensation whose compensation is set pursuant to his Amended and Restated Employment Agreement. Objectives of Cavco’s Compensation Programs Cavco’s executive compensation program is structured to achieve the following objectives: • to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified, energetic and talented executives necessary for Cavco to deliver consistently superior results; • to create an incentive to increase stockholder returns by establishing a direct and substantial link between individual compensation and certain financial measures that have a direct effect on stockholder values; and • to create substantial long-term compensation opportunities for individual executive officers based not only on long-term corporate performance but also on sustained long-term individual performance. Role of Compensation Consultants The Compensation Committee has authority to retain compensation consultants in determining or recommending executive or director compensation pursuant to its written charter (including the sole authority to approve such consultant’s fees and other retention terms). The Compensation Committee did not engage a compensation consultant during fiscal year 2013. 23 Table of Contents Benchmarking Market pay levels are one of many elements used by Cavco to maintain competitive pay opportunities for our named executive officers. For fiscal year 2013, we considered our compensation peer group for benchmarking the named executive officer’s compensation to include the following former and current industry participants: Champion Enterprises, Inc.; Coachmen Industries, Inc.; Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc.; Palm Harbor Homes, Inc.; and Skyline Corporation. These peers were chosen because each was a publicly traded manufactured housing company at the time of Cavco’s spin-off from Centex Corporation in June 2003. Because manufactured housing peer group data is somewhat dated, we also considered the following Arizona-based companies with whom we may compete with for executives and which were selected because, during our last fiscal year, each was publicly traded and roughly similar in size to Cavco in terms of annual revenue: Amtech Systems, Inc.; iGo, Inc.; Inventure Foods, Inc.; Limelight Networks, Inc.; and Universal Technical Institute, Inc. In connection with its compensation decisions for fiscal year 2013, peer group compensation information was used as guidance to ascertain whether our named executive officers’ base salaries and incentive compensation programs are generally aligned with those positions in the peer group. While the Compensation Committee does review peer group compensation information, it is not the sole factor it considers in setting executive compensation. The Compensation Committee also takes into account other factors, including the responsibilities of the executive’s position, an executive’s compensation history, experience, performance, tenure, and Cavco’s performance. The Compensation Committee did not set compensation programs to be a specified percentage above or below, or equal to, the comparable compensation for the peer group. Mr. Stegmayer’s compensation is set by his Amended and Restated Employment Agreement. In setting compensation for Messrs. Keener, Lott and Urness, the Compensation Committee considered the input of the Chief Executive Officer, the historical compensation paid to such executive officers (and in the cases of Messrs. Keener and Lott historical compensation paid both while employed by the Company and by their predecessor companies), and certain historical compensation paid to operating executives of peer companies. Role of Management in Establishing and Awarding Compensation The Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves the base salary levels and incentive opportunity levels for Cavco’s named executive officers. Our Chief Executive Officer, with the assistance of our Human Resources Department and General Counsel, regularly provides information and recommendations to the Compensation Committee on the performance of the Chief Financial Officer, appropriate levels and components of compensation, including equity grants, as well as such other information as the Compensation Committee may request. Following the conclusion of a fiscal year, the Compensation Committee makes compensation awards for the named executive officers, including awards under short-term and long-term incentive compensation plans. To assist the Compensation Committee with its review, management provides the Compensation Committee with peer group performance results and compensation data and other information as requested by the Compensation Committee. Components of Executive Compensation In structuring the specific components of executive compensation, Cavco is guided by the following principles: • compensation programs should be performance based, market driven and stockholder aligned; • annual compensation should be set within reasonable ranges of the annual compensation for similar positions with similarly-sized and similar types of companies that engage in one or more of the principal businesses in which Cavco engages; • a compensation program must have elements that are not solely performance based in order to be competitive in attracting and retaining talented executives; • bonus payments should vary with the individual’s performance and Cavco’s financial performance; 24 Table of Contents • a significant portion of compensation should be in the form of long-term, equity-linked incentive compensation that aligns the interests of executives with those of the stockholders and that creates rewards for long-term sustained company performance and the achievement of Cavco’s strategic objectives; and • compensation programs should not encourage executives to take unnecessary risks. The Compensation Committee attempts to structure its compensation programs to the named executive officers as performance-based compensation that is tax deductible. However, the Compensation Committee may award compensation that is or could become non-deductible when such awards are in the best interest of Cavco, balancing tax efficiency with long-term strategic objectives. Base Salary The Compensation Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the base salary levels for the named executive officers. In developing salary amounts, the Compensation Committee conducts a general review of salaries for similar positions in our peer group. In setting base salary levels, the Compensation Committee also considers an executive’s compensation history, experience, performance, tenure, and potential for significant contributions to Cavco’s profitability. Mr. Stegmayer’s Amended and Restated Employment Agreement specifies base salary levels for fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee may review the base salary levels at any time and, in its sole discretion, may adjust Mr. Stegmayer’s then current base salary; provided, however, that the Compensation Committee may not decrease Mr. Stegmayer’s then current base salary without his prior written consent. If the term of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement is extended, then the annual base salary of Mr. Stegmayer will be determined by the Compensation Committee in its reasonable business judgment provided that in no event may the Compensation Committee decrease the annual base salary of Mr. Stegmayer below that of any previous fiscal year during such renewal period. Mr. Stegmayer’s base salary for fiscal year ended March 30, 2013 was $450,000. Mr. Urness, who does not have an employment agreement, was paid a base salary of $210,000 for fiscal year ended March 30, 2013. See the Summary Compensation Table on page 30. Mr. Lott does not have an employment agreement and was paid a base salary of $220,000 for fiscal year ended March 30, 2013. See the Summary Compensation Table on page 30. Mr. Keener does not have an employment agreement and was paid a base salary of $240,000 for fiscal year ended March 30, 2013. See the Summary Compensation Table on page 30. Incentive Compensation Incentive compensation for Mr. Stegmayer is based solely upon Cavco’s pre-tax income. Under the terms of Mr. Stegmayer’s amended and restated employment agreement, Mr. Stegmayer was paid non-equity incentive compensation in an amount equal to (i) 5% of the first $4 million of pre-tax income of the Company for the fiscal year, plus (ii) 6% of the next $16 million of pre-tax income of the Company for the fiscal year, plus (iii) 3% of pre-tax income of the Company for the fiscal year above $20 million, provided that the cash award on pre-tax income of any material assets or businesses acquired after June 30, 2011 shall be determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole judgment, in good faith, in consultation with Mr. Stegmayer. Based solely on this formula, for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2013, Mr. Stegmayer received non-equity incentive compensation in the amount of $958,887. See the Summary Compensation Table on page 30. Under Mr. Urness’s plan he is eligible to receive incentive compensation based upon the Company’s pre-tax income for the fiscal year ending March 30, 2013. Under the terms of his plan, Mr. Urness is eligible to receive incentive compensation equal to (i) 1.0% of the first $10,000,000 in pre-tax income of the Company, and (ii) 1.5% of pre-tax income of the Company greater than $10,000,000. Based solely on this formula, for fiscal year ended March 30, 2013 Mr. Urness received non-equity incentive compensation in the amount of $199,722. See the Summary Compensation Table on page 30. 25 Table of Contents Under Mr. Lott’s incentive plan, he is eligible to receive quarterly incentive payments equal to 3.72% of the aggregate pre-tax income of the Company’s seven Fleetwood Homes plants. Based solely on this formula, for fiscal year ended March 30, 2013 Mr. Lott received non-equity incentive compensation in the amount of $283,992. See the Summary Compensation Table on page 30. Under Mr. Keener’s incentive plan, he is eligible to receive incentive compensation based upon quarterly pre-tax income of Palm Harbor Homes’ retail subsidiary, Palm Harbor Villages. Under the terms of his plan, Mr. Keener is eligible to receive incentive compensation of: (i) ten percent (10%) of quarterly pre-tax income of Palm Harbor Villages of $0 to $500,000; (ii) nine percent (9%) of quarterly pre-tax income of Palm Harbor Villages of $500,001 to $750,000; (iii) eight percent (8%) of quarterly pre-tax income of Palm Harbor Villages of $750,001 to $1,000,000; (iv) seven percent (7%) of quarterly pre-tax income of Palm Village of $1,000,001 to $1,250,000; (v) six percent (6%) of quarterly pre-tax income of Palm Harbor Villages of $1,250,001 to $1,500,000 and (vi) five percent (5%) of quarterly pre-tax income of Palm Harbor Villages greater than $1,500,001. Based solely on this formula, for fiscal year ended March 30, 2013 Mr. Keener received non-equity incentive compensation in the amount of $31,756. See the Summary Compensation Table on page 30. Long-Term Compensation The existing stock incentive program of Cavco, which is subject to annual review and may be revised or superseded in the future, is designed to provide incentive to the participants under such program, which include the named executive officers, to focus on maximizing Cavco’s return to stockholders and to plan and prepare properly for Cavco’s future. Stock options or grants of restricted stock may be granted at the fair market value on the date of the grant under the Cavco Industries, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended. Under the terms of Mr. Stegmayer’s Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, he is eligible for a supplemental long-term cash incentive consisting of (i) a special performance bonus, in the amount of up to $1 million, conditioned upon the attainment of the following 4-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) performance targets, using the Company’s pre-tax earnings for the four fiscal quarters ended on December 31, 2010 as a base year (i.e., calendar year 2010) compared to the four fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2014 (i.e., calendar year 2014): below 30%, vesting is 0%; 30%, vesting is 50%; 40%, vesting is 80%; and 50% and greater, vesting is 100% (the Compensation Committee will compute the vesting percentage on a pro-rata basis); and (ii) a cash award of $3 million, conditioned upon Mr. Stegmayer’s employment by the Company on December 31, 2014, subject to pay-out over time. On June 5, 2012, consistent with the terms of Mr. Stegmayer’s Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, Cavco granted to Mr. Stegmayer a non-qualified option to purchase 24,500 shares of common stock, which has a Black-Scholes value of 100% of Mr. Stegmayer’s base salary for fiscal year 2013, subject to minor rounding as provided in the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement. The grant to Mr. Stegmayer is subject to a four year pro-rata vesting schedule commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date. In determining the vesting of the awards made, the Compensation Committee followed the Company’s legal obligations set forth in Mr. Stegmayer’s Amended and Restated Employment Agreement. On June 5, 2012, consistent with Cavco’s objective of creating incentives for its executive officers to increase stockholder returns by establishing a direct and substantial link to executive compensation, Cavco granted a non-qualified option to purchase 5,700 shares of common stock to Mr. Urness. The grant to Mr. Urness represents a Black-Scholes value of 50% of Mr. Urness’ base salary for fiscal year 2013. The grant to Mr. Urness is subject to a four year pro-rata vesting schedule commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date, which is consistent with the Company’s past practice and typical vesting schedule. On July 11, 2012 Cavco granted a non-qualified option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Keener as part of an incentive program for managers of Palm Harbor’s retail operations. A grant of stock options was not made to Mr. Lott in fiscal year 2013. 26 Table of Contents Perquisites and Other Compensation Cavco does not offer perquisites, except for a very limited car allowance offered to one of its named executive officers that falls below the threshold for proxy statement disclosure. The named executive officers may participate in Cavco’s 401(k) plan and other health and welfare programs that are available to all other full-time employees. Employment, Severance, and Change in Control Agreements Mr. Stegmayer’s Amended and Restated Employment Agreement provides for: (a) a term ending March 30, 2015, and is automatically extended for successive one-year periods unless the Board or Mr. Stegmayer elects not to renew the term by notice to the other at least 90 days prior to the end of the then current term; (b) a base salary of $450,000 for fiscal year 2013 and $500,000 for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, subject to periodic review and adjustment by the Compensation Committee, but in no event can the base salary be reduced without Mr. Stegmayer’s consent; (c) non-equity incentive compensation in an amount equal to (i) 5% of the first $4 million of pre-tax income of the Company for the fiscal year, plus (ii) 6% of the next $16 million of pretax income of the Company for the fiscal year, plus (iii) 3% of pretax income of the Company for the fiscal year above $20 million, provided that the cash award on pretax earnings of any material assets or businesses acquired after June 30, 2011 shall be determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole judgment, in good faith, in consultation with Mr. Stegmayer; (d) supplemental long-term cash incentive consisting of (i) a special performance bonus, in the amount of up to $1 million, conditioned upon the attainment of the following 4-year CAGR performance targets, using the Company’s pre-tax earnings for the four fiscal quarters ended on December 31, 2010 as a base year (i.e., calendar year 2010) compared to the four fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2014 (i.e., calendar year 2014): below 30%, vesting is 0%; 30%, vesting is 50%; 40%, vesting is 80%; and 50% and greater, vesting is 100% (the Compensation Committee will compute the vesting percentage on a pro-rata basis); and (ii) a cash award of $3 million, conditioned upon Mr. Stegmayer’s employment by the Company on December 31, 2014, subject to the exceptions discussed below; and (e) an annual grant of options to acquire shares of the Common Stock of the Company, the value of which shall equal 100% of Mr. Stegmayer’s then base salary using the Black-Scholes option value model (vesting criteria and vesting timing shall be at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee). The special performance bonus is to be paid as soon as practicable after the Company files its financial statements for the quarter ending December 31, 2014 with the SEC (but no later than February 28, 2015) upon confirmation by the Compensation Committee of achievement of the performance target(s). The cash award of $3 million is payable in $500,000 increments as follows: $500,000 (together with simple interest at 5% per annum on the unpaid balance) between January 1 and January 30 in each of the years 2015 through 2020. Mr. Stegmayer’s Amended and Restated Employment Agreement includes provisions for certain payments to be made upon his termination or resignation. If Cavco terminates Mr. Stegmayer’s employment and such termination constitutes a Termination for Cause (as defined in the employment agreement), or if Mr. Stegmayer voluntarily resigns prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the employment agreement) of Cavco and such resignation does not constitute a Termination for Good Reason (as defined in the employment agreement), then Mr. Stegmayer is entitled to receive only his then current base salary on a pro rata basis to the date of such termination or resignation. If prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, Mr. Stegmayer dies or becomes Disabled (as defined in the employment agreement), or if Cavco terminates his employment and such termination constitutes a Termination Without Cause or Mr. Stegmayer terminates his employment and such termination constitutes a Termination for Good Reason, then Mr. Stegmayer shall be entitled to the following: (a) continued payment of his then current base salary for each fiscal year under the remaining term of the employment agreement plus one year following the expiration of the term; (ii) a single lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to two times his Average Annual Bonus (as defined in the employment agreement) for the preceding two fiscal years; and (c) continued health insurance benefits for a period of 18 months. If within two years after the occurrence of a Change in Control of Cavco: (a) Cavco terminates Mr. Stegmayer’s employment and such termination constitutes a Termination Without Cause; or (b) Mr. Stegmayer voluntarily resigns his employment for any reason, then in each case Cavco must pay to Mr. Stegmayer a lump sum termination payment equal to two times the sum of his then current base salary and Average Bonus. The Amended and Restated Employment Agreement also provides that Mr. Stegmayer will not disclose any confidential information of the Company during or after the term of the agreement. 27 Table of Contents During his employment with the Company and for a period of two years following his resignation or termination (and in no event for a period of less than four years from the effective date of the employment agreement), Mr. Stegmayer is precluded from engaging in any business or associating with any entity that is actively engaged in any competitive business with the Company or any of its affiliates, in any geographic area in which the Company conducts business or sells products. In the event of a Termination Without Cause (as defined in the employment agreement) prior to December 31, 2014, Mr. Stegmayer may elect, immediately after such discharge by written notice which, to be effective, must be received by the Company on or before the tenth day after such discharge, to forego the long-term cash incentives described above, in which case the non-compete provisions described in the previous paragraph will be null and void. The table below reflects the amount of compensation that would have been payable to Mr. Stegmayer in the event of termination of his employment, as provided in the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement. The amounts shown assume that termination was effective as of March 30, 2013, and are estimates of the amounts that would have been paid to Mr. Stegmayer upon his termination. The actual amounts that would be payable can be determined only at the time of termination. We have not included below any accrued but unpaid salary or payment of accrued and vested benefits and unused vacation time, as those amounts would be paid in the event of termination of employment for any reason. Equity awards that are not subject to acceleration and the value of health benefits, which is nominal, are not included below. Executive Benefits and Payments Upon Termination Termination for Cause or Voluntary Resignation prior to Change in Control Termination without Cause prior to a Change in Control; or Resignation by Executive for good reason; or if Executive dies or becomes Disabled Termination without Cause or Voluntary Resignation within two years after a Change in Control Base Salary $17,308 $1,517,308 $1,017,308 Bonus — $1,268,234 $1,268,234 CAGR Bonus — $1,000,000 $1,000,000 $3 Million Cash Bonus — $3,000,000 $3,000,000 Total: $17,308 $6,785,542 $6,285,542 We do not have written or oral employment, severance or change in control agreements with Messrs. Urness, Lott and Keener. Compensation Policies and Practices as they relate to Risk Management The Compensation Committee believes that our compensation policies and practices do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk-taking, and that the level of risk that the policies and practices do encourage is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Compensation Committee has reviewed Cavco’s compensation policies and practices for its employees as they relate to risk management and has determined that such policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Cavco. Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee reviews and approves all salary and other remuneration for our executive officers and oversees matters relating to our employee compensation and benefit programs. The Compensation Committee is comprised of David A. Greenblatt, its Chairperson, William C. Boor, and Jack Hanna. 28 Table of Contents No member of the Compensation Committee is an employee of Cavco.

PROPOS AL 3: ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) enables the Company’s stockholders to vote on an advisory (non-binding) basis regarding the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers (commonly referred to as “Say on Pay”). For a comprehensive description of our executive compensation program and compensation philosophy, please refer to the Company’s CD&A beginning on Page 23. Although the advisory vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board will review the results of the vote and consider the outcome when making future decisions concerning our executive compensation program. In deciding how to vote on this proposal, the Board points out the following factors, many of which are more fully discussed in the CD&A: • Our executive compensation programs are designed to depend significantly on the achievement of performance goals that the Committee believes drive long-term stockholder value; • Our pay practices are designed not to encourage management to take unacceptable risks; • Our Compensation Committee reviews peer group compensation to confirm that our programs are not outside the norm among peer group companies (See “Benchmarking” on Page 24; and • We believe the Company’s executive compensation programs are well suited to promote the Company’s objectives in b oth the short and long-term. Recomme ndation of the Board The Board of Directors believes that the compensation of our Named Executive Officers is appropriate and recommends a vote “FOR” the following advisory resolution: RESOLVED, that the stockholders of the Company approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table, and the related compensation tables, notes and narrative set forth in this proxy statement. 32 Table of Contents PROPOSAL NO. 4: APPROVAL OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE SHARES At the annual meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof, our stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the issuance of up to approximately 2,031,193 shares of our common stock in consideration for the Fleetwood Shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement. Further information with respect to the issuance of the Shares, the Stock Purchase and the Sellers is contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, including the sections “The Stock Purchase” beginning on this page and “The Stock Purchase Agreement” beginning on page 37. Pursuant to NASDAQ Rule 5635(a), the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast at a meeting where a quorum is present is required to approve the issuance of the Shares. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal, and if you fail to vote, it will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal unless the shares are counted as present at the Annual Meeting. Broker non−votes will not affect the outcome of the vote on this proposal. THE STOCK PURCHASE The following is a description of the material aspects of the Stock Purchase, including the Stock Purchase Agreement. While we believe that the following description covers the material terms of the Stock Purchase, the description may not contain all of the information that is important to you. We encourage you to carefully read this entire proxy statement, including the Stock Purchase Agreement attached to this proxy statement at Annex A, for a more complete understanding of the Stock Purchase. Background of the Stock Purchase On March 10, 2009, Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization relief under the provisions of chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, Riverside Division. Seeking to participate in the sale of the Debtors’ manufactured housing assets, the Company and TAVF formed Fleetwood with an initial contribution of $35.0 million each for equal fifty-percent ownership interests. On July 21, 2009, Fleetwood entered into an asset purchase agreement with the Debtors and ultimately purchased certain assets and liabilities of its manufactured housing business. Pursuant to the formation of Fleetwood, the Company and TAVF entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement which provides that after August 17, 2014, or at any time after Fleetwood has earned net income of at least $10.0 million in each of its two most recently completed consecutive fiscal years, excluding the gain on bargain purchase, TAVF has the right (the “Put Right”) to require Cavco to purchase all of TAVF’s shares of Fleetwood common stock for an amount based upon a calculation that was intended to approximate fair value (the “Calculation”). Likewise, Cavco has the right (“Call Right”) to require TAVF to sell all of its shares of Fleetwood common stock based on the same circumstances and the Calculation as described above for the Put Right. Following the Fleetwood Acquisition, the Company and TAVF subsequently contributed an additional $36.0 million each in anticipation of the purchase of Palm Harbor, which was completed during the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. TAVF subsequently transferred a portion of its interest in Fleetwood to an affiliate along with the applicable rights and obligations. The transfer had no impact on Cavco’s ownership interest in Fleetwood. 33 Table of Contents The degree to which the fair value calculation would be affected by operational decisions relating to Palm Harbor have been uncertain. Given the time needed to properly assess these impacts and conform the Calculation to address the complexity which the Palm Harbor businesses added to Cavco’s consolidated financial statements, a further amendment to the Calculation was postponed until reasonable and appropriate updates could be determined. Following the purchase of Palm Harbor, the parties had discussions from time-to-time addressing the need to update and amend the calculation in order to preserve the intention of the parties with respect to the Calculation. As these discussions progressed, the parties determined the Calculation method to be too complex and discussed replacement of the Calculation with total stockholders’ equity of Fleetwood as a reasonable approximation of fair value. As of March 30, 2013, the conditions for exercise of the Put Right and Call Right were not met, and were not expected to be met until March 31, 2014 at the earliest and August 18, 2014 at the latest. The discussions surrounding the replacement of the Calculation led to the agreement to consummate the purchase approximately one year earlier than when the conditions for the Put Right or Call Right are met. The share transfer arrangements and other terms discussed between the parties were appealing to the Company for a variety of reasons, such as, among other things, (i) immediate accretion to earnings, (ii) accretion to book value, (iii) an increase in stockholders' equity of approximately $92.0 million; and (iv) the Company’s traditional conservative capital structure, accounting processes and administration will be solidified and simplified. The following table outlines the accretion effects on fully diluted earnings per share of the transaction for the year ended March 30, 2013 using Cavco common stock as consideration per the Stock Purchase Agreement, on a pro forma basis, as if the transaction had occurred on April 1, 2012. Cavco shares issued in the stock Purchase 2,031,193 Cavco fully diluted shares outstanding as of March 30, 2013 7,027,204 Pro forma fully diluted shares outstanding as of March 30, 2013 9,058,397 Fiscal year 2013 net income $ 10,297,000 Pro forma fully diluted earnings per share $ 1.14 Fully diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2013 0.71 Fully diluted earnings per share accretion $ 0.43 Successful completion of the Stock Purchase will provide Cavco’s shareholders with 100% ownership of Fleetwood, which is consistent with the original intention of the Company and TAVF at the outset of their partnership in forming Fleetwood. Full ownership will maximize the Company’s ability to successfully leverage the combined capabilities of the various operating business lines. Cavco shareholders will also be entitled to 100% of earnings from all of the operations reported as net income in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. On a pro forma basis, had the transaction occurred on April 1, 2012, Cavco common stockholders, for the year ended March 30, 2013, would have been entitled to net income of $10.3 million compared to $5.0 million actually realized. The $5.3 million difference represents a 107% increase in the historical net income attributable to Cavco common stockholders. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Cavco will issue the Shares, effectively increasing the number of shares outstanding by a factor of up to approximately 22.6% of the shares outstanding after issuance. This increase contrasts favorably with the Sellers’ current non-controlling interest proportion of approximately 34.2% of the Company’s total stockholders’ equity plus redeemable non-controlling interest as of March 30, 2013. An additional positive contrast by another measure, as of March 30, 2013, redeemable non-controlling interest represents approximately 48.6% of the Company’s total stockholders’ equity plus redeemable non-controlling interest less goodwill and other intangibles, net. 34 Table of Contents The increase in Cavco’s total stockholder’s equity balance will be equivalent to the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interest at the most recent quarter end date prior to closing. Using Cavco’s consolidated balance sheet as of March 30, 2013 as a reference, if the transaction were to have closed on March 30, 2013, the resulting balance of Cavco’s total stockholder’s equity would have increased by approximately $92.0 million to approximately $268.9 million, approximately 52.1% higher than the $176.9 million balance as reported on the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 11, 2013. This growth in Cavco’s total stockholders’ equity will have the effect of improving investor metrics that are based on total stockholders’ equity. Management believes that higher total stockholders’ equity balance and increases in corresponding financial metrics improves the Company’s opportunities to gain additional exposure to a greater number of institutional and other investors. Although it is subject to other market variables, the Company also believes the resulting increase in total stockholders’ equity may generate additional investor interest in the Company. Growth has been an important part of the Company’s history since it became a stand-alone publicly traded entity in 2003. An additional benefit of the use of Cavco common stock to effect the proposed transaction is preservation of existing and future capital for further growth opportunities that may arise. Cavco’s 50% investment in Fleetwood Homes was originally made using cash. Cavco has garnered a reputation as an effective cash manager in growing its businesses. The intended preservation of approximately $47.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of March 30, 2013, as reported on the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 11, 2013, allows flexibility for potential future opportunities and capital needs. If future opportunities do not result in the need for cash, depending on other factors including future profitability levels, other cash use alternatives will remain available including stock buyback opportunities and dividend payments. Issuance of the Shares will not require the Company to incur debt. The Company currently carries no debt other than financings associated with past securitizations. The issuance of the shares as consideration preserves the Company’s borrowing capacity in the event that a suitable use of debt presents itself in the future. The foregoing discussion summarizes the material information and factors considered by our Board in its consideration of the proposed transaction. Our Board collectively reached the unanimous decision to approve the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions related to the Stock Purchase in light of the factors described above and other factors that each member of our Board believed were appropriate. In view of the variety of factors and the quality and amount of information considered, our Board did not find it practicable to, and did not make specific assessments of, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. Individual members of our Board of Directors may have given different weight to different factors. Our Reasons for the Stock Purchase In the course of reaching its unanimous decision to approve the Stock Purchase Agreement and to recommend that our stockholders vote to approve the issuance of the Shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Board consulted with our officers and legal counsel, and considered a number of factors in its deliberations that it believed weighed in favor of the transaction, including, but not limited to, the following: • historical information concerning Fleetwood’s business, financial performance and condition, technology, operations, management and competitive position; • the financial condition, results of operations, and businesses of the Company and Fleetwood before and after giving effect to the Stock Purchase, and the respective contributions of each entity to the combined company; • current financial market conditions and historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to our common stock; • that the Company and Sellers are parties to the Shareholders’ Agreement, that includes put and call rights relating to the Sellers’ 50% ownership interest in Fleetwood. The terms of the proposed transaction in the Stock Purchase Agreement represents an independently negotiated transaction as the conditions for the put or call right to become exercisable have not been met as of the date of this proxy statement. • the fact that the purchase would be accretive to earnings immediately; 35 Table of Contents • the fact that the purchase would be accretive to book value at a rate higher than the percentage of Cavco stock required to acquire the assets; • a net increase in current earnings attributable to Cavco’s stockholders could be realized; • the Sellers agreement to the lock-up, standstill and voting rights provisions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement; • the opportunity to issue stock for the purchase as opposed to payment in cash in the event of a Call by the Company; • the fact that using stock for the purchase will increase stockholders' equity by approximately $92.0 million; • the Company is effectively making an equity offering without investment banking fees and no disruption in the public trading of the Company’s stock The foregoing discussion of the items that our Board considered is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes items that it believes to be material. In view of the complexity and wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, that our Board considered, our Board did not find it practical to quantify, rank or otherwise weight the factors considered. In considering the various factors, individual members of our Board considered all of these factors as a whole and concluded that, on balance, the risks and countervailing factors relevant to the Stock Purchase were outweighed by the potential benefits that it expected the Company and the Company’s stockholders to achieve as a result of the Stock Purchase. Recommendation of Our Board For reasons including those described above under the heading “The Stock Purchase – Our Reasons for the Stock Purchase,” on June 14, 2013, our Board unanimously approved the Stock Purchase and the related transactions, including the issuance of the Shares, and recommends such matter to our stockholders, subject to the Board’s right to withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation. In particular, the Board of Directors unanimously: • determined that the terms of the Stock Purchase are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of our stockholders; • approved the Stock Purchase and related transactions, and authorized us to enter into the Stock Purchase Agreement; and • recommends that our stockholders approve the issuance of the Shares. Stock Purchase Consideration Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company will issue up to approximately 2,031,193 shares of the Company’s common stock in consideration for the Fleetwood Stock, which represents up to approximately 22.6% of the Company’s common stock following the issuance. The Shares issuable to Seller will be determined by dividing the purchase price of $91,403,696 by the average of the volume weighted average prices (the “ VWAP Price ”) on each of the sixty (60) consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day immediately prior to the closing date; provided, however, that in no event shall the average of the VWAP Price of the Company’s common stock used to determine the amount of the Shares issued be less than $45.00 per share or greater than $55.00 per share. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Final VWAP Calculation is less than $45.00 per share, the Final VWAP Calculation shall be $45.00, and where the Final VWAP Calculation is greater than $55.00 per share, the Final VWAP Calculation shall be $55.00. 36 Table of Contents Effective Time of the Stock Purchase The closing shall occur, and the Stock Purchase shall be effective, no later than August 31, 2013 after the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions and the obligations of the Company and the Sellers to the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, including approval of the issuance of the Shares by our stockholders. However, because the Stock Purchase is subject to a number of conditions, we cannot predict exactly when the closing will occur or if it will occur at all. U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Stock Purchase The Stock Purchase Agreement provides that the payment of the purchase price in Cavco common stock will not be structured as a tax-free exchange under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Anticipated Accounting Treatment We will account for the Stock Purchase as an equity transaction under GAAP. The results of operations of Fleetwood have already been consolidated with the Company’s financial statements and will continue to be consolidated after the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement. The redeemable noncontrolling interest held by the Sellers will be eliminated and converted to equity. Regulatory Approvals Under the HSR Act the Stock Purchase may not be consummated until required information and materials have been furnished to the DOJ and the FTC, and certain waiting period requirements have expired or been terminated. At any time before the closing of the transaction, the DOJ, the FTC or others could take action under the antitrust laws with respect to the acquisition. Appraisal Rights Under applicable law, the Company’s stockholders do not have the right to an appraisal of the value of their shares in connection with the Stock Purchase. Registration Rights We have agreed to use our best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement covering the resale of all of the Shares. THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT The following is a summary of the material terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, which is attached at Annex A to this proxy statement and incorporated herein by reference. The Stock Purchase Agreement has been attached to this document to provide you with information regarding its terms. The Stock Purchase Agreement is not intended to provide any other factual information about us or Fleetwood. The following description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Stock Purchase Agreement included at Annex A. You should refer to the full text of the Stock Purchase Agreement for details of the Stock Purchase and the terms and conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement. 37 Table of Contents General The Company has entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with the Sellers pursuant to which we will acquire the Fleetwood Stock. The Company currently already owns 50% of the outstanding shares of Fleetwood so following the closing of the Stock Purchase the Company will own 100% of the outstanding shares of Fleetwood. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the closing must occur no later than August 31, 2013. However, because the Stock Purchase is subject to a number of conditions, we cannot predict exactly when the closing will occur or if it will occur at all. Stock Purchase Consideration Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company will issue up to approximately 2,031,193 shares of the Company’s common stock in consideration for the Fleetwood Stock, which represents up to approximately 22.6% of the Company’s common stock following the issuance. The Shares issuable to Seller will be determined by dividing the purchase price of $91,403,696 by the average of the volume weighted average prices (the “ VWAP Price ”) on each of the sixty (60) consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day immediately prior to the closing date; provided, however, that in no event shall the average of the VWAP Price of the Company’s common stock used to determine the amount of the Shares issued be less than $45.00 per share or greater than $55.00 per share. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Final VWAP Calculation is less than $45.00 per share, the Final VWAP Calculation shall be $45.00, and where the Final VWAP Calculation is greater than $55.00 per share, the Final VWAP Calculation shall be $55.00. Conditions to Closing of the Stock Purchase Certain Purchaser and Seller conditions must be satisfied or waived before the Company and the Sellers become obligated to complete the Stock Purchase, including, but not limited to, those summarized below: • approval by our stockholders of the issuance of the Shares at the annual meeting; • receipt of approval of the transactions under the HSR Act and to the fulfillment, prior to or concurrently with the closing, of the condition that no statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree shall have been enacted, promulgated, entered into or enforced by any federal of state court or other Governmental Authority which has the effect of making illegal, impeding or otherwise restraining or prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby; • accuracy of each party’s respective representations and warranties in the Stock Purchase Agreement; and • compliance by each party with its covenants in the Stock Purchase Agreement. Registration, Voting, Lock-Up and Standstill Provisions Each Seller will be subject to certain restrictions on their ability to transfer their shares of our common stock, including, among other things, a one year prohibition on the transfer of the shares of our common stock issued to the Sellers in connection with the Stock Purchase, except for Permitted Transfers (defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement). Additionally, we have agreed to use our best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement covering the resale of all of the Shares. From and after the closing and continuing until the termination of the Standstill Period (defined below), the Sellers agreed that they will vote all Shares in accordance with the recommendations of the Board with respect to any action, proposal or other matter to be voted on by the stockholders of Cavco. Additionally, the Sellers have agreed not to do any of the following without the prior written consent of the Company beginning on the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement and ending on the first date on which the Sellers in the aggregate cease to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding common equity securities of the Company (the “Standstill Period”): 38 Table of Contents • Acquire beneficial ownership of common equity securities of the Company or any other securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Company; • Deposit any securities of the Company in a voting trust or similar arrangement or subject any voting securities of the Company to any voting agreement, pooling arrangement or similar arrangement, or grant any proxy with respect to any voting securities of the Company; • Enter, agree to enter, propose or offer to enter into or facilitate any merger, business combination, tender offer, recapitalization, restructuring, change in control transaction or other similar extraordinary transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries; • Make, or in any way participate or engage in, any “solicitation” of “proxies” to vote, or advise or knowingly influence any person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; • Call, or seek to call, a meeting of the shareholders of the Company or initiate any shareholder proposal for action by the shareholders of the Company; • Form, join or in any way participate in a Group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), with respect to any voting securities of the Company; • Otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the Board, or the management or policies of the Company; • Publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement prohibited by, or inconsistent with, the foregoing; or • Advise or knowingly assist or encourage or enter into any discussions, negotiations, agreements or arrangements with any other person or Group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) in connection with the foregoing. Termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement Under Specified Circumstances Under circumstances specified in the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company may terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement and, as a result, the Stock Purchase would not be completed. These include, but are not limited to, the following circumstances: • if our stockholders do not approve the issuance of the Shares by August 31, 2013; or • by mutual written consent of the Company and the Sellers. Expenses and Reimbursement All external transaction costs and expenses invoiced to the parties in connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement shall be paid by the relevant party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Stock Purchase is consummated. Representations and Warranties The Stock Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties regarding Fleetwood relating to, among other things: • organization; • authority to enter into the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement; • consents and filings; and • title to the Shares. 39 Table of Contents The Stock Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties of us relating to, among other things: • organization; • authority to enter into the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement; and • consents and filings.

Recommendation of the Board The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the issuance of the Shares, and proxies solicited by the Board will be voted in favor of such approval unless a stockholder indicates otherwise on the proxy. GENERAL Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires Cavco directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of Cavco’s equity securities, to file initial reports of ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual reports of ownership with the SEC and NASDAQ. Such persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish Cavco with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file with the SEC. Based solely on its review of the copies of such reports received by it with respect to fiscal year 2013 or written representations from certain reporting persons, Cavco believes that its directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of Cavco’s equity securities have complied with the filing requirements of Section 16(a) for fiscal year 2013 applicable to such persons. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Transactions with Related Persons We have entered into Change of Control Agreements with certain of our executive officers. See above under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Employment, Severance and Change of Control Arrangements.” 40 Table of Contents Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons Cavco has established policies and other procedures regarding approval of transactions between Cavco and any employee, officer, director, and certain of their family members and other related persons, including those required to be reported under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. These policies and procedures are generally not in writing, but are evidenced by long standing principles set forth in our code of conduct or adhered to by our Board. As set forth in the Audit Committee Charter, as and to the extent required under applicable federal securities laws and related rules and regulations, and/or the NASDAQ Rules, related party transactions are to be reviewed and approved, if appropriate, by the Audit Committee. Generally speaking, we enter into such transactions only on terms that we believe are at least as favorable to Cavco as those that we could obtain from an unrelated third party. Code of Conduct Cavco has adopted a code of conduct that applies to Cavco directors and all employees, including Cavco’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller. Cavco’s code of conduct is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote: • honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; • full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that Cavco files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by Cavco; • compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; • the prompt internal reporting of violations of the code of conduct to an appropriate person or persons identified in the code of conduct; and • accountability for adherence to the code of conduct. Cavco has posted the text of its code of conduct on its Internet website at www.cavco.com . Cavco’s code of conduct will remain accessible on its Internet website. However, if Cavco ever desires to remove its code of conduct from its Internet website, then, prior to such removal, Cavco will either file its code of conduct as an exhibit to its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC or will undertake to provide a copy of the code of conduct to any person without charge.

RECITALS WHEREAS, TAVF owns 982.65 shares of common stock of Fleetwood Homes, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ Fleetwood ”), representing 48.44% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Fleetwood; WHEREAS, WHCF owns 31.63 shares of common stock of Fleetwood, representing 1.56% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Fleetwood (together with the shares owned by TAVF, the “ Shares ”); WHEREAS, Purchaser owns 1,014.28 shares of common stock of Fleetwood, representing 50% of the total issued outstanding shares of common stock of Fleetwood; WHEREAS Sellers and Purchaser are parties to that Shareholder’s Agreement dated as of August 17, 2009 and any amendments thereto (the “ Shareholders’ Agreement ”); WHEREAS, Sellers intend to sell to Purchaser and Purchaser intends to purchase from Sellers the Shares; and WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein without definition have the respective meanings assigned to them in Article XII . NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the terms and provisions set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the performance thereof and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I - PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES SECTION 1.1 Purchase and Sale .  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Sellers shall sell, transfer, assign and deliver to Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall acquire and accept from Sellers, the Shares, constituting the Sellers’ entire interest in Fleetwood stock. SECTION 1.2 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Shares shall be the aggregate sum of Ninety-One Million Four Hundred Three Thousand Six Hundred Ninety-Six Dollars ($91,403,696) (subject to adjustment below, the “ Purchase Price ”) which Purchase Price shall be paid to Sellers in accordance with Schedule 1.02 (the “ Closing Payment Schedule ”) in such aggregate number of shares (the “ Issued Shares ”) of newly issued common stock of the Purchaser, issuable to Sellers in accordance with the Closing Payment Schedule in a number equal to the Purchase Price divided by the average of the volume weighted average prices on the Principal Market (as defined below) as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. on each of the sixty (60) consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the “ Final VWAP Calculation ”); provided, however, that in no event shall the average of the volume weighted average trading prices of the Common Stock of the Purchaser used to determine the amount of Issued Shares (the “ VWAP Price ”) be less than $45.00 per share or greater than $55.00 per share.

(a)    The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (unless the Purchaser is not then eligible to register for resale the Issued Shares on Form S-3, in which case such registration shall be on another appropriate form in accordance with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) relating to the resale of the Issued Shares by the Sellers on a continuous basis no later than 60 days after the filing of the Purchaser’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2014 (the “Filing Deadline”). (b)    Each Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser such information set forth on the Registration Statement Questionnaire attached hereto as Exhibit A that relates to the Registration Statement, or as otherwise reasonably required by the Purchaser or the managing underwriters, if any, to effect the registration of such Seller's Issued Shares, and if not so furnished to the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall have the right to rely on the most recent information available to the Purchaser regarding the Seller and the Issued Shares. (c)    The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 1.3(a) to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable after such filing, but in no event later than 60 days thereafter, and promptly after such Registration has been declared effective, file a final prospectus to be used for sales of the Issued Shares in connection with such Registration Statement in accordance with Rule 424 under the Securities Act (the “Prospectus”). (d)    The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to keep each Registration Statement effective pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act at all times until the date on which the Sellers shall have sold all of the Issued Shares (the “Registration Period”), including, without limitation, by filing any necessary amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement. The Purchaser shall ensure that any Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Agreement (including any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of prospectuses, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made) not misleading. (e)    The Purchaser shall permit the Sellers and/or their legal counsel to review and comment upon any Registration Statement, Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto at least five (5) Business Days prior to its filing with the SEC and not file any Registration Statement or amendment or supplement thereto in a form to which the Sellers reasonably objects. (f)    The Purchaser shall notify the Sellers in writing of the happening of any event, as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, as a result of which the Registration Statement or the Prospectus includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement or Prospectus to correct such untrue statement or omission.  In addition, if any stop order or suspension of the Registration Statement or Prospectus is issued, the Purchaser shall immediately notify the Sellers and take all reasonable action to obtain the withdrawal of such order or suspension at the earliest practicable moment. (g)    The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to cause the Issued Shares covered by the Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which securities of the same class or series issued by the Purchaser are then listed. (h)    The Purchaser shall not identify any Seller as an underwriter without its prior written consent in any public disclosure or filing with the SEC or the Principal Market. (i)    The Purchaser shall enter into such customary agreements for underwritten secondary offerings and take all such other reasonable actions and deliver or cause to be delivered such other document and instruments requested by the Sellers or the lead underwriter in any secondary underwritten offering in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Cavco Shares. 2 ARTICLE II - THE CLOSING SECTION 2.1 Closing.

(a)    At any time and from time to time during the Standstill Period, and subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Section 11.1, the Purchaser shall have a right of first offer if any Seller (the "Offering Seller") proposes to Transfer all or any portion of any shares of common stock of the Purchaser that the Seller owns (the “Offered Stock”) to any independent third party.

(b)    The Offering Seller shall give written notice (the “ ROFO Notice” , which may be in the form of an email) to the Purchaser stating its bona fide intention to Transfer the Offered Stock and specifying the number of Offered Stock and the material terms and conditions, including the price, pursuant to which the Offering Seller proposes to Transfer the Offered Stock.  The ROFO Notice shall constitute a Seller’s offer to Transfer all of the Offered Stock to the Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.1, which offer shall be irrevocable until the end of the ROFO Purchaser Option Period (defined below), and the consummation of any sale of the Offered Stock to the Purchaser. (c)    The ROFO Notice shall constitute a Seller’s offer to Transfer all of the Offered Stock to the Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.1, which offer shall be irrevocable until the end of the Purchaser Option Period, and the consummation of any sale of the Offered Stock to the Purchaser. (d)    By delivering the ROFO Notice, a Seller represents and warrants to the Purchaser that: (i)    Seller has full right, title and interest in and to the Offered Stock described in the ROFO Notice; (ii)    Seller has all the necessary power and authority and has taken all necessary action to Transfer the Offered Stock described in the ROFO Notice as contemplated by this Section 11.1; and (iii)    the Offered Stock described in the ROFO Notice is free and clear of any and all Liens. 10 SECTION 11.2 Exercise of Right of First Offer .

The Purchaser ROFO Exercise Notice shall be binding upon delivery and irrevocable by the Purchaser.  If the Purchaser fails to deliver the Purchaser ROFO Exercise Notice during the Purchaser Option Period, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected not to purchase any of the Offered Stock. (c)    The failure of the Purchaser to deliver a Purchaser ROFO Exercise Notice  by the end of the Purchaser Option Period shall constitute a waiver of its rights of first refusal under this Article XI with respect to the Transfer of the Offered Stock, but shall not affect its rights with respect to any future Transfers. (d)    In the event that the Purchaser shall have exercised its rights to purchase the Offered Stock, then the applicable Seller shall sell such Offered Stock to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase such Offered Stock, within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the Purchaser Option Period. Seller shall take all actions as may be reasonably necessary to consummate the sale contemplated by this Article XI including, without limitation, entering into agreements and delivering certificates and instruments and consents as may be deemed necessary or appropriate.  At the closing of any sale and purchase pursuant to this Section 11.2(d) , Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser certificates (if any) representing the Offered Stock to be sold, free and clear of any Liens or encumbrances, accompanied by evidence of transfer and all necessary transfer taxes paid and stamps affixed, if necessary, against receipt of the purchase price therefor and the amount of any transfer taxes, if any, from the Purchaser by certified or official bank check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

These financial statements were previously audited and included in Palm Harbor’s Form 10-K for the year ended March 26, 2010.  However, Palm Harbor’s auditor was not able to perform its customary procedures to its satisfaction to enable it to consent to the inclusion of its prior audit report in the referenced Form 8-K/A filing due to the untimely and limited cooperation of Palm Harbor and the bankruptcy estate of Palm Harbor towards the completion of those procedures.  Accordingly, (i) the Palm Harbor financial statements are considered unaudited, preliminary and subject to change (ii) the Form 8-K/A filing is incomplete and untimely, and (iii) the Palm Harbor financial statements are not presented in accordance with Regulation S-X of the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, the Company does not satisfy the requirements to provide financial statements in accordance with Regulation S-X, including, but not limited to Rule 3-05, in any filing, registration statement or proxy statement requiring such financial statements, due to the absence of the consent of Palm Harbor’s independent registered public accounting firm with respect to Palm Harbor’s financial statements.
