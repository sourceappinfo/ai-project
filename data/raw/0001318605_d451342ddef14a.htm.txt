Stockholders of record may access the proxy materials on the website listed above or request a printed set of the proxy materials be sent to them by following the instructions in the Notice of Internet Availability. The Notice of Internet Availability also explains how you may request that we send future proxy materials to you by e-mail or in printed form by mail. If you choose the e-mail option, you will receive an e-mail next year with links to those materials and to the proxy voting site. We encourage you to choose this e-mail option, which will allow us to provide you with the information you need in a timelier manner, will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will conserve natural resources. Your election to receive proxy materials by e-mail or in printed form by mail will remain in effect until you terminate it. If you are a beneficial owner, you will not receive a Notice of Internet Availability directly from us, but your broker, bank or other intermediary will forward you a notice with instructions on accessing our proxy materials and directing that organization how to vote your shares, as well as other options that may be available to you for receiving our proxy materials.

As of the Record Date, holders of common stock were eligible to cast an aggregate of 3,169,269,409 votes at the 2023 Annual Meeting. 2 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record or as a beneficial owner? A: You are the “stockholder of record” of any shares that are registered directly in your name with Tesla’s transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. A minority of our stockholders are stockholders of record . We have sent the Notice of Internet Availability directly to you if you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may grant your voting proxy directly to Tesla or to a third party or vote in person at the 2023 Annual Meeting as described more fully below. You are the “beneficial owner” of any shares (which are considered to be held in “street name”) that are held on your behalf by a brokerage account or by a bank or another intermediary that is the stockholder of record for those shares. The vast majority of our stockholders are beneficial owners . If you are a beneficial owner, you did not receive a Notice of Internet Availability directly from Tesla, but your broker, bank or other intermediary forwarded you a notice together with voting instructions for directing that organization how to vote your shares. You may also attend the 2023 Annual Meeting in person (if you are eligible per our random drawing to attend in person), but because a beneficial owner is not a stockholder of record, you may not vote in person at the 2023 Annual Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from the organization that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Q: How can I vote my shares in person at the 2023 Annual Meeting? A: You may vote shares for which you are the stockholder of record in person at the 2023 Annual Meeting (if you are eligible per our random drawing to attend in person). You may vote shares for which you are the beneficial owner in person (if you are eligible per our random drawing to attend in person) at the 2023 Annual Meeting only if you obtain a “legal proxy” from the broker, bank or other intermediary that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares. Even if you plan to attend the 2023 Annual Meeting, and are eligible per our random drawing, we recommend that you also direct the voting of your shares as described below in the question entitled “How can I vote my shares without attending the 2023 Annual Meeting?” so that your vote will be counted even if you later decide not to attend the 2023 Annual Meeting. Q: How can I vote my shares virtually at the 2023 Annual Meeting? A: In order to join, submit questions and vote virtually via the Internet at the 2023 Annual Meeting, you will need a 15-digit secure “control number” unique to you, which you may obtain as follows. › › If you are a “stockholder of record” with shares registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company (a minority of Tesla stockholders), you can find the control number on the Notice of Internet Availability or paper proxy card that was sent to you. › › If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you may: › › Register in advance to obtain a control number. Please ask your broker, bank or other intermediary that holds your shares for a “legal proxy” for the 2023 Annual Meeting and submit a copy of it from your e-mail address with “Legal Proxy” in the subject line to legalproxy@computershare.com or by mail to Computershare at Tesla, Inc. Legal Proxy, P.O. Box 43001, Providence, RI, 02940-3001. If your request is received no later than 3:00 p.m. Central Time on May 11, 2023, you will receive a confirmation e-mail with your control number; or › › Use the control number received with your voting instruction form. Please note, however, that this option is intended to be provided as a convenience to beneficial owners only, and there is no guarantee this option will be available for every type of beneficial owner voting control number. Please go to www.meetnow.global/TESLA2023 for more information on the available options and registration instructions.

A: The stockholders of record of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting must either (1) be present in person or virtually via the Internet at the 2023 Annual Meeting or (2) have properly submitted a proxy in order to constitute a quorum at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, abstentions and broker “non-votes” are counted as present, and therefore are included for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the 2023 Annual Meeting. A broker “non-vote” occurs when an organization that is the stockholder of record that holds shares for a beneficial owner, and which is otherwise counted as present or represented by proxy, does not vote on a particular proposal because that organization does not have discretionary voting power under applicable regulations to vote on that item and has not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner. Q: What proposals will be voted on at the 2023 Annual Meeting? A: The proposals scheduled to be voted on at the 2023 Annual Meeting are: Tesla Proposals › › A Tesla proposal to elect three Class I directors listed in this proxy statement to serve for a term of three years, or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified (Proposal One); › › A Tesla proposal to approve executive compensation on a non-binding advisory basis (Proposal Two); › › A Tesla proposal to approve the frequency of future votes on executive compensation on a non-binding advisory basis (Proposal Three); › › A Tesla proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 (Proposal Four); and Stockholder Proposals › › A stockholder proposal regarding reporting on key-person risk, if properly presented (Proposal Five). 4 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Q: What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? A: Proposal Vote Required Broker Discretionary Voting Allowed Proposal One—Tesla proposal to elect three Class I directors Majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors No Proposal Two—Tesla proposal to approve executive compensation on a non-binding advisory basis Majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter No Proposal Three—Tesla proposal to approve the frequency of future votes on executive compensation on a non-binding advisory basis The frequency (every one, two or three years) receiving the most votes will be considered the frequency recommended by stockholders No Proposal Four—Tesla proposal to ratify the appointment of independent registered public accounting firm Majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter Yes Proposal Five—Stockholder proposal regarding reporting on key-person risk, if properly presented Majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter No Q: How are votes counted? A: All shares entitled to vote and that are voted in person at the 2023 Annual Meeting will be counted, and all shares represented by properly executed and unrevoked proxies received prior to the 2023 Annual Meeting will be voted at the 2023 Annual Meeting as indicated in such proxies. You may vote “ FOR ,” “ AGAINST ” or “ ABSTAIN ” on each of the nominees for election as director (Proposal One), and on each of Proposals Two, Four and Five. You may vote to recommend, by non-binding vote, the frequency of future executive compensation votes (Proposal Three) for a vote every one, two or three years, or you may abstain from voting. With respect to the election of directors, Tesla’s bylaws provide that in an uncontested election, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required to elect a director. Abstentions with respect to any director nominee (Proposal One) or any of Proposals Two, Four and Five will have the same effect as a vote against such nominee or Proposal. Consequently, each director nominee will be elected, and each of Proposals Two, Four and Five will be approved or ratified, as applicable, only if the number of shares voted “ FOR ” such nominee or Proposal exceeds the total number of shares voted “ AGAINST ” or to “ ABSTAIN ” with respect to such nominee or Proposal. You may vote to recommend, by non-binding vote, the frequency of future executive compensation votes (Proposal Three) for a vote every one, two or three years, or you may abstain from voting. The Board will consider the frequency option that receives the greatest number of votes among the three frequency options to be the recommendation of the stockholders. Abstentions will have no effect on Proposal Three. Q: What is the effect of not casting a vote or if I submit a proxy but do not specify how my shares are to be voted? A: If you are a stockholder of record and you do not vote by proxy card, by telephone or via the Internet before the 2023 Annual Meeting, or in person or virtually via the Internet at the 2023 Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted at the 2023 Annual Meeting. If you submit a proxy, but you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board (or, if there is no recommendation of the Board on a Proposal, your shares will not be voted on such Proposal). Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 5 Table of Contents If you are a beneficial owner and you do not provide the organization that is the stockholder of record for your shares with voting instructions, the organization will determine if it has the discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter. Under applicable regulations, brokers and other intermediaries have the discretion to vote on routine matters, such as Proposal Four, but do not have discretion to vote on non-routine matters such as Proposals One, Two, Three and Five. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions to that organization, it may vote your shares only on Proposal Four and any other routine matters properly presented for a vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Q: What is the effect of a broker “non-vote”? A: An organization that holds shares of Tesla’s common stock for a beneficial owner will have the discretion to vote on routine proposals if it has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner at least ten days prior to the 2023 Annual Meeting. A broker “non-vote” occurs when a broker, bank or other intermediary that is otherwise counted as present or represented by proxy does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to vote the shares. A broker “non-vote” will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the 2023 Annual Meeting, but will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote with respect to a particular proposal as to which that broker “non-vote” occurs. Thus, a broker “non-vote” will not impact our ability to obtain a quorum for the 2023 Annual Meeting and will not otherwise affect the approval by a majority of the votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote of any of the Proposals One, Two, Three and Five. As described above, broker non-votes are not expected to occur in connection with Proposal Four. Q: How does the Board recommend that I vote? A: The Board recommends that you vote your shares: › › “ FOR ” the three nominees for election as Class I directors (Proposal One); › › “ FOR ” the approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of executive compensation (Proposal Two); › › “ EVERY THREE YEARS ” for the approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of a triennial executive compensation vote (Proposal Three); › › “ FOR ” the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 (Proposal Four); and › › “ AGAINST ” the approval of the stockholder proposal regarding reporting on key-person risk (Proposal Five). Q: What happens if additional matters are presented at the 2023 Annual Meeting? A: If any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the 2023 Annual Meeting, including, among other things, consideration of a motion to adjourn the 2023 Annual Meeting to another time or place, the persons named as proxy holders, Elon Musk and Zachary Kirkhorn, or either of them, will have discretion to vote the proxies held by them on those matters in accordance with their best judgment. Tesla has received notice from a stockholder of an intent to propose a resolution at the 2023 Annual Meeting requesting reporting on plans to eradicate child labor and forced labor from its supply chain. Other than the floor proposal, Tesla does not currently anticipate that any other matters will be raised at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Q: Can I change my vote? A: If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote (1) by submitting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy) using any of the voting methods described above in the question entitled “ How can I vote my shares without attending the 2023 Annual Meeting? ,” (2) by providing a written notice of revocation to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas 78725, Attention: Legal Department, with a copy sent by e-mail to shareholdermail@tesla.com , prior to your shares being voted, or (3) by attending the 2023 Annual Meeting and voting in person or virtually via the Internet, which will supersede any proxy previously submitted by you. However, merely attending the meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically request it. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you may generally change your vote by (1) submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or other intermediary or (2) if you have obtained a “legal proxy” from the organization that holds your shares giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the 2023 Annual Meeting and voting in person. However, please consult that organization for any specific rules it may have regarding your ability to change your voting instructions. 6 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Q: What should I do if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability, notice from my broker, bank or other intermediary, or set of proxy materials? A: You may receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability, notice from your broker, bank or other intermediary, or set of proxy materials, including multiple copies of proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you are a beneficial owner with shares in more than one brokerage account, you may receive a separate notice or voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability or proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each Tesla proxy card or voting instruction card that you receive, and/or follow the voting instructions on each Notice of Internet Availability or other notice you receive, to ensure that all your shares are voted. Q: Is my vote confidential? A: Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed either within Tesla or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary for applicable legal requirements, (2) to allow for the tabulation and certification of the votes and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation. Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy cards, which may be forwarded to Tesla management. Q: Who will serve as inspector of election? A: The inspector of election will be Computershare Trust Company, N.A. Q: Where can I find the voting results of the 2023 Annual Meeting? A: We will publish final voting results in our Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the SEC and made available on its website at www.sec.gov within four (4) business days of the 2023 Annual Meeting. Q: Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the 2023 Annual Meeting? A: Tesla will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials and soliciting votes. We may reimburse brokerage firms, custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and other persons representing beneficial owners for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation material to those beneficial owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies in person or by other means. These directors, officers and employees will not be additionally compensated but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in doing so. Q: What is the deadline to propose actions for consideration at next year’s annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate individuals to serve as directors? A: You may submit proposals, including recommendations of director candidates, for consideration at future stockholder meetings. For inclusion in Tesla’s proxy materials —Stockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in Tesla’s proxy statement and for consideration at the next annual meeting of stockholders by submitting their proposals in writing in a timely manner to: Tesla, Inc. 1 Tesla Road Austin, Texas 78725 Attention: Legal Department with a copy sent by e-mail to shareholdermail@tesla.com . Any correspondence that is not addressed precisely in accordance with the foregoing, including any correspondence directed to a specific individual, may not be received timely or at all, and we strongly recommend that you also send such correspondence by e-mail and verify that you receive a confirmation of receipt from Tesla. In order to be included in the proxy statement for the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholder proposals must be received in accordance with the above instructions no later than December 8, 2023, provided that if the date of the Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 7 Table of Contents 2024 annual meeting of stockholders is more than 30 days from the one-year anniversary of the 2023 Annual Meeting, the deadline will instead be a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials for the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. In addition, stockholder proposals must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “ Exchange Act ”). Our bylaws also provide for a right of proxy access. This enables stockholders, under specified conditions, to include their nominees for election as directors in our proxy statement. Under our bylaws, a stockholder (or group of up to 20 stockholders) who has continuously owned at least 3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock for at least three consecutive years and has complied with the other requirements in our bylaws may nominate up to 20% of the Board and have such nominee(s) included in our proxy statement. To be timely, notice of nominees should be delivered to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas 78725, Attention: Legal Department, with a copy sent by e-mail to shareholdermail@tesla.com, not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date on which Tesla mailed its proxy materials to stockholders for the previous year’s annual meeting of stockholders. As a result, notice of nominees for our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders must be delivered to the address above not later than December 8, 2023 and not earlier than November 8, 2023. To be brought at annual meeting —In addition, you can find in Tesla’s bylaws an advance notice procedure for stockholders who wish to present certain matters, including nominations for the election of directors, at an annual meeting of stockholders without inclusion in Tesla’s proxy materials. In general, Tesla’s bylaws provide that the Board will determine the business to be conducted at an annual meeting, including nominations for the election of directors, as specified in the Board’s notice of meeting or as properly brought at the meeting by the Board. However, a stockholder may also present at an annual meeting any business, including nominations for the election of directors, specified in a written notice properly delivered within the Notice Period (as defined below), if the stockholder held shares at the time of the notice and the record date for the meeting. Such notice should be delivered to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas 78725, Attention: Legal Department, with a copy sent by e-mail to shareholdermail@tesla.com . The notice must contain specified information about the proposed business or nominees and about the proponent stockholder. If a stockholder who has delivered such a notice does not appear to present his or her proposal at the meeting, Tesla will not be required to present the proposal for a vote. The “Notice Period” is the period not less than 45 days nor more than 75 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date on which Tesla mailed its proxy materials to stockholders for the previous year’s annual meeting of stockholders. As a result, the Notice Period for the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders will start on January 22, 2024 and end on February 21, 2024. However, if the date of the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders is advanced by more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 60 days after the one-year anniversary of the date of the 2023 Annual Meeting, the Notice Period will instead start 120 days prior to the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders and end on the later of (i) 90 days prior to such meeting or (ii) the 10 th day following our first public announcement of the date of the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. This is only a summary of the proxy access and advance notice procedures. Complete details regarding all requirements that must be met are found in our bylaws. You can obtain a copy of the relevant bylaw provisions by writing to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas 78725, Attention: Legal Department, or to shareholdermail@tesla.com via e-mail, or by accessing Tesla’s filings on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . All notices of proposals or director nominees by stockholders, whether or not requested for inclusion in Tesla’s proxy materials, must be addressed precisely as prescribed in this section to be received timely or at all. We strongly recommend that you also send such correspondence by e-mail and verify that you receive a confirmation of receipt from Tesla. Q: How may I obtain a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability or the proxy materials? A: If you are a stockholder of record and share an address with another stockholder of record, each stockholder may not receive a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability or proxy materials. Stockholders may request to receive separate or additional copies of the Notice of Internet Availability or proxy materials by calling our Investor Relations department at (512) 516-8177 or by writing to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas 78725, Attention: Investor Relations, or to ir@tesla.com . Upon such written or oral request, we will deliver promptly a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability and, if applicable, our proxy materials, to any stockholder at a shared address to which we delivered a single copy of any of these materials. Stockholders who share an address and receive multiple copies of the Notice of Internet Availability or proxy materials can also request to receive a single copy by following the instructions above. Q: Who can help answer my questions? A: Please contact our Investor Relations department by calling (512) 516-8177 or by writing to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, TX 78725, Attention: Investor Relations, or to ir@tesla.com via email. 8 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents INVESTOR OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT Our Approach Our unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance, and our mission requires a long-term focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders. Our corporate governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which have set Tesla up to achieve long-term success and our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Some examples include our decisions to: • Manufacture all-electric vehicles from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV components; • Establish an international network of our stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite regulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so; • Build Gigafactory Nevada, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively; • Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their own utility; • Deploy FSD Beta incrementally, resulting in over 130 million cumulative miles driven with FSD Beta to date; and • Compensate our CEO only if other stockholders realize tremendous value. These and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately, decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies. Year-Round Engagement Our Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs stakeholder feedback. The Board maintains an active, year-round dialogue with our largest stockholders to ensure that Tesla’s Board and management understand and consider the issues that matter most to our stockholders. This includes focused one-on-one meetings between our Board and stockholders throughout the year that are designed to give institutional stockholders an opportunity to better understand our strategy and governance and raise any concerns, and allow our directors to become better informed about our stockholders’ views and concerns. Board Responsiveness Through the Board’s engagement program discussed above, we have received, and continue to periodically receive, helpful input regarding a number of stockholder-related matters. Moreover, members of the Board and management from time to time seek input from our investors when considering important corporate actions, including our consideration of, and responses to, stockholder proposals that involve corporate governance and alignment with stockholder interests. As a result, we have adopted a number of significant changes, including but not limited to: • Progressively adding directors who are independent under the requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“ Nasdaq ”) and bring additional viewpoints and key skills in different areas as we evolve, including Kathleen Wilson- Thompson in 2018, Hiromichi Mizuno in 2020, Joe Gebbia in 2022 and JB Straubel as a nominee this year; • Following the passing proposal at the 2022 Annual Meeting relating to proxy access, meeting with key stockholders to discuss their views and formulate a framework to address the proposal, after which the Board voted to amend the bylaws of the Company to enable proxy access, in such a manner as to reflect such stockholder views; • Hosting Investor Day in March 2023, in which Tesla leaders presented on key areas important to our success, affording stockholders more detailed assessments of the performance, achievements, growth opportunities and areas of focus for our businesses, and addressing stockholder feedback requesting greater visibility into our business leaders and roadmap; • Amending our pledging policy to (i) cap the aggregate loan or investment amount that can be collateralized by the pledged stock of our CEO to the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock, and (ii) lower the percentage used to calculate the maximum loan or investment amount borrowable by directors and officers (other than our CEO) based on the total value of such director or officer’s pledged stock from 25% to 15%; Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 9 Table of Contents • Enhancing our proxy statement disclosures, including with respect to our corporate governance approach, succession planning, risk oversight, Committee engagement and director skills; • Publishing an annual Impact Report, and providing disclosures including those aligned with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board recommendations, as well as EEO-1 data; and • Recommending management proposals in prior years, including at the 2022 Annual Meeting, to reduce director terms and eliminate applicable supermajority voting requirements. This year, we will be publishing our fifth annual Impact Report with enhanced disclosures across people, environment, product and supply chain. In response to stockholder engagement, we are disclosing additional Scope 3 emissions categories and aligning with the TCFD’s recommended climate-related disclosures. We will also expand disclosures on the culture we continue to build and enhance at Tesla, how we engage and aim to retain our employees, progress we are making on displacing fossil fuels, the efficiency and safety of our products and how we manage risks in the supply chain, among many other topics. For further information, please navigate to the “Impact” page of the Investor Relations section on our website. We intend to publish our 2022 Report by the end of April 2023. Information contained on, or accessible through, our website and in our Impact Report, is not incorporated in, and is not part of, this proxy statement or any other report or filing we make with the SEC. Our Board’s Commitment to Governance Our Board believes in maintaining stockholder confidence through, among other things, demonstrating its responsiveness to stockholder feedback and its commitment to corporate governance. Accordingly, to provide an enhanced voice to our stockholders in approving fundamental corporate matters, the Board is committed to enabling the elimination of certain supermajority voting requirements in our charter and bylaws through the process outlined below. In each of the last four years, our Board repeatedly proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to reduce director terms and/or to eliminate certain supermajority voting. However, such amendments failed to pass each time that the Board proposed them. Because the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the total outstanding shares entitled to vote is required to approve such amendments, similar proposals cannot pass unless we achieve such a stockholder participation rate. In response to not reaching the required stockholder participation rate, during 2022, we took active steps in an effort to increase the participation rate of our retail investors through the development of our Shareholder Platform (discussed below), outreach campaigns, direct mailings, one-on-one engagements and through social media channels. This resulted in achieving our highest stockholder participation rate in the last five years in 2022 of over 63%, though still short of the required 66 2/3% participation rate. This year, we will again marshal our resources and continue our efforts to further increase retail investor participation rates as rapidly as possible, via events such as our 2023 Investor Day, and with an active communications campaign via our new Shareholder Platform and social media channels encouraging retail stockholders to vote their shares. Once we have achieved a total stockholder participation rate of at least 65% at a stockholder meeting, the Board will again propose charter and bylaw amendments to eliminate supermajority voting requirements. To the extent that this proposal to eliminate supermajority voting requirements achieves the required threshold to pass, this will unlock a gateway for our Board and stockholders to adopt further stockholder-driven governance actions, including, without limitation, the right for stockholders to act by written consent or to call a special meeting, and the declassification of the Board. Furthermore, as previously discussed, the Board is consistently listening and receptive to taking further governance actions when appropriate. Shareholder Platform In 2022, building on our efforts to enhance engagement among our retail stockholder base, Tesla launched our Shareholder Platform. Any Tesla stockholder, regardless of holdings size, can sign up to stay informed about investor-related topics such as quarterly filings and event announcements, and are eligible for selection to participate in in-person access to Tesla events such as the Tesla Semi launch event, AI Day 2, Investor Day and our annual meetings. Tesla has one of the largest retail stockholder bases of any public company. Our retail stockholders are incredibly engaged and tend to have a very strong understanding of the Company, and are an important base of support and feedback for management and the Board. We will continue to build the system to maximize depth of engagement and reach. Our goal is for every stockholder who wants to engage with the Company to have a meaningful framework for interaction through the Shareholder Platform. 10 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Hybrid Annual Stockholder Meetings Beginning in 2020, we have conducted our annual meetings both in-person and online through a live webcast and online stockholder tools. Our online format opens up engagement to all stockholders, regardless of the amount of stock owned and geography, and allows our substantial retail stockholder population to hear directly from our Board and management, as well as to submit questions online. At the same time, due to investor feedback and interest, we continue to also host our meetings in-person so stockholders have the opportunity to engage with our Board and management in-person. Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 11 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT P ROPOSALS P ROPOSAL O NE T ESLA P ROPOSAL FOR E LECTION OF D IRECTORS General Tesla’s Board currently consists of eight members who are divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. Our bylaws permit the Board to establish by resolution the authorized number of directors, and eight directors are currently authorized. Any increase or decrease in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of an equal number of directors. The Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will continue to frequently evaluate the optimal size and composition of the Board to allow it to operate nimbly and efficiently, while maintaining new ideas, expertise and experience among its membership. Hiromichi Mizuno, a Class I director, will not stand for re-election to the Board when his current term ends at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Accordingly, the Board has nominated JB Straubel to succeed Mr. Mizuno as a Class I director. Mr. Straubel joined Tesla in 2004, and spent 14 years as our Chief Technology Officer, where he played a key role in our battery cell design, and engineering and production. Mr. Straubel also led the construction and concept of Gigafactory Nevada and the production ramp of our Model 3. After his departure from Tesla in 2019, Mr. Straubel founded Redwood Materials Inc. (“ Redwood ”), which is dedicated to building a circular supply chain to power a sustainable world and accelerate the reduction of fossil fuels. We believe that Mr. Straubel’s extensive operational experience in senior leadership at the Company, combined with his engineering expertise and passion for cleantech, will make him an important asset in our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Nominees for Class I Directors Three candidates have been nominated for election as Class I directors at the 2023 Annual Meeting for a three-year term expiring in 2026. Upon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has nominated Elon Musk, Robyn Denholm and JB Straube l for election as Class I directors. Biographical information about each of the nominees is contained in the following section. A discussion of the qualifications, attributes and skills of each nominee that led the Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to the conclusion that he or she should be elected or continue to serve as a director follows each of the director and nominee biographies. If you are a stockholder of record and you sign your proxy card or vote by telephone or over the Internet but do not give instructions with respect to the voting of directors, your shares will be voted “ FOR ” the election of Messrs. Musk and Straubel and Ms. Denholm. Each of Messrs. Musk and Straubel and Ms. Denholm has accepted such nomination; however, in the event that a nominee is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the 2023 Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for any nominee who shall be designated by the Board to fill such vacancy. If you wish to give specific instructions with respect to the voting of directors, you may do so by indicating your instructions on your proxy card or when you vote by telephone or over the Internet. If you are a beneficial owner holding your shares in street name and you do not give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other intermediary, that organization will leave your shares unvoted on this matter.

This proposal, commonly known as a “say-on-pay” proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to weigh in on our named executive officers’ compensation as a whole. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation or any specific named executive officer, but rather the overall compensation of all of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. We currently have a policy providing for a triennial say-on-pay vote and, in Proposal Three (advisory vote on the frequency of future executive compensation advisory approvals), the Board recommends that stockholders approve an advisory resolution supporting continued triennial say-on-pay votes. Accordingly, we anticipate that the next advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers would occur in 2026. The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board. The say-on-pay vote will, however, provide information to us regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices, which the Compensation Committee will be able to consider when determining executive compensation for the remainder of the current fiscal year and beyond. The Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against our named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will consider our stockholders’ concerns and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. Summary of the 2022 Executive Compensation Program The following is a summary of some of the key points of our 2022 executive compensation program: • Tesla continues to emphasize structuring compensation incentives to reward our named executive officers based on performance. • Equity awards weigh heavily in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear and measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. In 2020, the last year any of our named executive officers received equity awards, such awards were all granted in the form of stock options. As a result, a significant portion of our named executive officers’ total compensation is entirely at risk, depending on long-term stock price performance. • Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. No named executive officer currently has any severance or change of control arrangement. • Each named executive officer is employed at will and is expected to demonstrate exceptional personal performance in order to continue serving as a member of the executive team. • Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s future compensation was at-risk in the form of the remaining unvested stock options under the 10-year performance-based stock option award granted to Elon Musk in January 2018 (the “ 2018 CEO Performance Award ”). • In particular, the 2018 CEO Performance Award consisted of 12 equal tranches, each which vested upon the achievement of a market capitalization milestone matched to one of eight revenue-based operational milestones or eight Adjusted EBITDA-based operational milestones, all of which were viewed as difficult hurdles at the time of grant. While our stockholders benefit from each incremental increase in Tesla’s performance and stock price, aligning Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 23 Table of Contents their interests with Mr. Musk’s incentives, the tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested only upon the full achievement of specific milestones, making it even more challenging for Mr. Musk to realize value from such increases. As of the date of this proxy statement, all of the tranches have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk’s payment of the exercise price of $23.34 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the three-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2022 (the “ 2022 Stock Split ”) and the five-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020 (the “ 2020 Stock Split ”), and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise. See “ Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief Executive Officer Compensation ” below for more details. For detailed information about Tesla’s executive compensation program, see the “ Executive Compensation ” section beginning on page 40 below. Tesla believes that the information provided above and within the “ Executive Compensation ” section of this proxy statement demonstrates that Tesla’s executive compensation program was designed appropriately and is working to ensure management’s interests are aligned with our stockholders’ interests to support long-term value creation. Proposed Resolution Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote “FOR” the following resolution at the 2023 Annual Meeting: “RESOLVED, that the Company’s stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company’s Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the other related disclosure.” THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE TESLA PROPOSAL FOR A NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE APPROVING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 24 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents P ROPOSAL T HREE T ESLA P ROPOSAL FOR N ON -B INDING A DVISORY V OTE ON THE F REQUENCY OF THE F UTURE N ON -B INDING V OTE ON E XECUTIVE C OMPENSATION The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “ Dodd-Frank Act ”) enables our stockholders to indicate, at least once every six years, how frequently we should seek a non-binding vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the SEC’s compensation disclosure rules, such as Proposal Two beginning on page 23 of this proxy statement. By voting on this Proposal Three, stockholders may indicate whether they would prefer a non-binding vote on named executive officer compensation once every one, two or three years. After careful consideration, our Board has determined that a non-binding vote on executive compensation that occurs triennially is the most appropriate alternative for the Company, and therefore our Board recommends that you vote for a three-year interval for the non-binding vote on executive compensation. In formulating its recommendation, our Board considered that given the nature of our compensation programs, a triennial vote would be sufficient for our stockholders to provide us with their input on our compensation philosophy, policies and practices. For example, our Chief Executive Officer has not received an equity award since 2018, and our other named executive officers have not received an equity award since 2020. A triennial approach also provides regular input by stockholders, while allowing time to evaluate the effects of our compensation program on performance over a longer period. However, we understand that our stockholders may have different views as to what is the best approach for the Company, and we look forward to hearing from our stockholders on this Proposal. The next advisory vote on the frequency of the non-binding vote on executive compensation is expected to be held at the 2029 annual meeting. You may cast your vote on your preferred voting frequency by choosing the option of one year, two years, three years or abstain from voting when you vote in response to the resolution set forth below: “RESOLVED, that the option of once every one year, two years or three years that receives the highest number of votes cast for this resolution will be determined to be the preferred frequency with which the Company is to hold a stockholder vote to approve the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the other related disclosure.” The Board will consider the frequency option that receives the greatest number of votes among the three frequency options to be the recommendation of the stockholders. However, this vote is advisory and is not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or our Board. The Board may decide that it is in the best interests of our stockholders and the Company to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation more or less frequently than the option approved by our stockholders. THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A TRIENNIAL VOTE AS THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH STOCKHOLDERS ARE PROVIDED AN ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

Sumtris ehf’s address is Vagnhöfði 8, 110, Reykjavik, Iceland. The stockholder proposal will be required to be voted upon at the 2023 Annual Meeting only if properly presented. Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement *** RESOLVED , Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla” or “Company”) shareholders ask the Board of Directors to oversee the preparation and maintenance of a publicly-disclosed report on Tesla’s Key-Person Risk, including identification of key persons and actions to ameliorate the impacts of their potential loss. Support : Tesla is frequently cited as a prominent example of a company that has so-called Key-Person Risk, due to the prominence of its CEO and the lack of a clear public succession plan or strategy to ameliorate the impacts of his loss. According to a 2018 Morgan Stanley report, in 2017 59 S&P 500 CEOs left their companies, and these companies then underperformed the market by 11% in the subsequent 12 months. Loss of a key person can be due to decisions from the key person to part with the company; the company to part with the key person; or outside factors (such as untimely death or disability)—and all of these are rarely easy to foresee long in advance. The standard procedure for dealing with Key-Person Risk is: 1. Identify key persons. 2. Document processes and procedures for their succession. 3. Spread knowledge / cross- train successors. 4. Manage communication with stakeholders 5. Financial mitigation of key-person loss impacts At present, Tesla shareholders can have little confidence that said risk has been at all ameliorated. Tesla specifically cites as a risk in its Q3 10-Q: “ We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer ” - offering no explanation of how it plans to deal with said risk. We ask the board to present to shareholders a clear and unambiguous Key-Person Risk amelioration strategy, documenting that all of the above five points have been met so that shareholders can be confident that the company will have qualified successors in mind who are prepared to lead the company to success in the event of a key-person departure. *** Opposing Statement of the Board The Board has considered this proposal and determined that it would be detrimental to the interests of Tesla and our stockholders. Contrary to the proponent’s claims, Tesla does recognize that recruiting and retaining a highly talented and experienced management team, not just the CEO, is critical to Tesla’s success. The Board and the management of Tesla are best equipped to carry out succession planning, as well as to handle day-to-day hiring, promotion and termination decisions. Such decisions take into consideration numerous criteria that are continually adapted to meet the evolving demands of Tesla, as determined by the Board and management. Adopting this proposal would cause unnecessary competitive harm to Tesla and undermine our efforts to recruit and retain management. The disclosures requested by the stockholder proponent, such as identification of key persons and the amelioration of their potential loss, would lead to potential disclosure of confidential and sensitive information such as our Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 27 Table of Contents business strategy and outlook, our most promising internal candidates, any desirable external candidates and other factors that our Board currently considers in the succession planning process. By publicly naming key persons and disclosing mitigation action plans, the proposal invites our competitors to target and recruit high-value executives away from Tesla, including those who may be identified as potential successors as part of succession planning. Furthermore, executives who are not identified as key persons or potential successors may choose to voluntarily leave Tesla and may create unwelcome tensions amongst the management team. Additionally, the Board already devotes significant time to leadership development efforts and implements several of the procedures discussed by the proponent above. Through regular discussions in meetings and executive sessions at both the Board and Committee level, the Board follows certain processes regarding the evaluation of management positions. Furthermore, the Compensation Committee provides guidance for, and reviews and approves, key leadership hiring and development, and retention plans to manage and mitigate the loss of any key persons. Our directors also regularly communicate and engage with management talent and potential successors to management positions in meetings held throughout the year, as well as through informal events and interactions, allowing them to further identify and provide exposure to qualified successors. From an external standpoint, during Tesla’s Investor Day, held in March 2023, we provided our stockholders additional visibility into our management team. As a result, this proposal, if adopted, would constrain the ability of the Board and management to effectively oversee and manage succession planning, day-to-day hiring, promotion and termination decisions, that require consideration of numerous criteria that are continually adapted to meet the ever-evolving demands of a company as dynamic as Tesla. In light of the foregoing, we believe the proposal would be detrimental to the interests of Tesla and our stockholders. THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST THE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING REPORTING ON KEY-PERSON RISK. 28 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Succession Planning The Board of Directors regularly discusses management succession planning in meetings and executive sessions at both the Board and Committee level. As described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and its charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews succession planning for the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, reporting its findings and recommendations to the Board and works with the Board in evaluating potential successors to these executive management positions. The Compensation Committee regularly discusses and evaluates company-wide talent pools and succession plans, including short-term and long-term succession plans for development, retention and replacement of senior leaders. Directors regularly interact and engage with not only senior management talent and potential successors to executive management positions, but also high-potential leaders throughout the Company. This engagement occurs in Board meetings held throughout the year, as well as through informal events and updates, and regular one-on-one touchpoints. Code of Business Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines The Board sets high standards for Tesla’s workforce, officers and directors. Tesla is committed to establishing an operating framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the Company and managing its affairs in a manner consistent with rigorous principles of business ethics. Accordingly, Tesla has adopted a Code of Business Ethics, which was amended in December 2021, and which is applicable to Tesla and its subsidiaries’ directors, officers and personnel. Tesla has also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which, in conjunction with our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and charters of the standing committees of the Board, form the framework for Tesla’s corporate governance. The Code of Business Ethics and the Corporate Governance Guidelines are each available on Tesla’s website at: http://ir.tesla.com/corporate . Tesla will disclose on its website any amendment to the Code of Business Ethics, as well as any waivers of the Code of Business Ethics, that are required to be disclosed by the rules of the SEC or Nasdaq. Director Independence The Board periodically assesses, with the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the independence of its members as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable laws. The Board undertook an analysis for each director and director nominee and considered all relevant facts and circumstances, including the director’s other commercial, accounting, legal, banking, consulting, charitable and familial relationships. The Board determined that with respect to each of its current members and director nominee, other than Elon Musk, who is our Chief Executive Officer, and Kimbal Musk, who is Elon Musk’s brother, there are no disqualifying factors with respect to director independence enumerated in the listing standards of Nasdaq or any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, and that each such member is an “independent director” as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable laws. In particular, the Board reviewed the following considerations: • Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, James Murdoch, Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk and JB Straubel and/or investment funds affiliated with them, have made minority investments in certain companies or investment funds, (i) of which other Tesla directors are founders, significant stockholders, directors, officers or managers, and/or (ii) with which Tesla has certain relationships set forth below in “ Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions .” The Board concluded that none of these investments are material so as to impede the exercise of independent judgment by any of Messrs. Ehrenpreis, Gebbia, Murdoch and Straubel. Board Leadership Structure Roles of Chair of the Board Following careful deliberation, the Board appointed Robyn Denholm to serve as the independent Chair of the Board in November 2018, having considered her strong leadership, independent presence and financial and business expertise on the Board over an extended period of time. Together, Ms. Denholm and our Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, comprise our senior Board leadership, which the Board believes is appropriate at this time to provide the most effective leadership structure for Tesla in a highly competitive and rapidly changing technology industry. As Chair of the Board, Ms. Denholm has broad authority and oversight over the affairs of the Board, with Mr. Musk available to her as a resource in this regard. Moreover, as an independent Chair of the Board, Ms. Denholm has the authority to direct the actions of the other independent directors and regularly communicate, as their representative, with Mr. Musk. Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 29 Table of Contents As Chair of the Board, Ms. Denholm, among other things: • reviews the agenda and materials for meetings of the independent directors; • consults with our Chief Executive Officer regarding Board meeting agendas, schedules and materials; • acts as a liaison between our Chief Executive Officer and the independent directors when appropriate; • otherwise communicates regularly with our Chief Executive Officer; • raises issues with management on behalf of the independent directors; • annually reviews, together with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board’s performance during the prior year; and • serves as the Board’s liaison for consultation and communication with stockholders as appropriate. Tesla also has a mechanism for stockholders to communicate directly with non-management directors (see “ Corporate Governance—Contacting the Board ” below). Committees of the Board In addition, the Board has four standing committees—the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee—which are each further described below. Each of the Board committees consists solely of independent directors, and the Board may appoint a chair to each committee. Our independent directors regularly meet in executive session and at such other times as necessary or appropriate as determined by the independent directors. In addition, as part of our governance review and succession planning, the Board (led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) evaluates our leadership structure to ensure that it remains the optimal structure for Tesla, reviews the composition, size and performance of the Board and its committees, evaluates individual Board members and identifies and evaluates candidates for election or re-election to the Board. See “ Corporate Governance—Process and Considerations for Nominating Board Candidates ” below for additional information. 30 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Board Role in Risk Oversight The Board is responsible for overseeing the major risks facing Tesla while management is responsible for assessing and mitigating Tesla’s risks on a day-to-day basis. The Board is assisted by our Committees, which consists entirely of independent directors, and report to the Board as appropriate on matters that involve specific areas of risk that each Committee oversees. Audit Committee The Audit Committee has scheduled periodic and annual reviews and discussions with management regarding significant risk exposures and incident metrics, including those relating to global financial, accounting and treasury matters, internal audit and controls, legal and regulatory compliance and data privacy and cybersecurity. These discussions cover the steps management has taken to monitor, control and report such exposures, as well as Tesla’s policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the risks associated with the Company’s corporate governance structure, succession planning, independence and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Disclosure Controls Committee The Disclosure Controls Committee oversees compliance and risks associated with the terms of the consent agreement between the SEC and the Company, and the controls and processes governing the Company’s and its senior executives’ disclosures and/or public statements that relate to the Company. Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee oversees management of risks relating to Tesla’s compensation plans and programs. Tesla’s management and the Compensation Committee have assessed the risks associated with Tesla’s compensation policies and practices for all employees, including non-executive officers. These include risks relating to setting ambitious targets for our employees’ compensation or the vesting of their equity awards, our emphasis on at-risk equity-based compensation, discrepancies in the values of equity-based compensation depending on employee tenure relative to increases in stock price over time and the potential impact of such factors on the retention or decision-making of our employees, particularly our senior management. Based on the results of this assessment, Tesla does not believe that its compensation policies and practices for all employees, including non-executive officers, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Tesla. Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 31 Table of Contents Board Meetings and Committees During fiscal 2022, the Board held eight meetings. We have a highly effective and engaged Board, and our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that each member is expected to ensure that other existing and future commitments, including employment responsibilities and service on the boards of other entities, do not materially interfere with the member’s service as director. When considering the effectiveness and productivity of its members, the Board evaluates many factors, including the director’s attendance at meetings, the participation and input of the director and the director’s preparation at meetings. Each director attended or participated in 75% or more of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board and the total number of meetings of all Committees on which such director served (in each case held during such director’s relevant period of service). 32 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Audit Committee Members Primary Responsibilities Audit • Reviewing and approving the selection of Tesla’s independent auditors, and approving the audit and non-audit services to be performed by Tesla’s independent auditors • Discussing the scope and results of the audit with the independent auditors and reviewing with management and the independent auditors Tesla’s interim and year-end operating results Robyn Denholm Joe Gebbia James Murdoch Hiromichi Mizuno(1) Oversight and Compliance • Providing oversight, recommendations, and under specified thresholds, approvals, regarding significant financial matters and investment practices, including any material acquisitions and divestitures •  Monitoring the integrity of Tesla’s financial statements and Tesla’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements as they relate to financial statements or accounting matters • Reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of Tesla’s internal control policies and procedures in addition to Tesla’s risk management, data privacy and data security Reporting • Reviewing and discussing the accounting assessment of our annual Impact Report and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures • Preparing the audit committee report that the SEC requires in Tesla’s annual proxy statement Financial Expertise and Independence Each of member of the Audit Committee is “independent” as such term is defined for audit committee members by the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable laws.

None of such persons is or was formerly an officer or an employee of Tesla. See “ Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions ” below for certain transactions involving Tesla in which members of the Compensation Committee may potentially be deemed to have an indirect interest. During 2022, no interlocking relationships existed between any member of Tesla’s Board or Compensation Committee and any member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company. Process and Considerations for Nominating Board Candidates The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, determining the criteria for Board membership, recommending Board candidates and proposing any changes to the composition of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s criteria and process for fulfilling these duties are generally as follows: • The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews the current composition and size of the Board, and oversees an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole and of its individual members. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee applies uniform evaluation processes and standards for all Board members, including in identifying, considering or recommending new candidates for the Board to fill vacancies or add additional directors and in recommending existing Board members for nomination to be re-elected at annual meetings of stockholders. • In carrying out the foregoing duties, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consistently seeks to achieve a complementary balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board. While the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not established specific minimum qualifications for director candidates, it considers all pertinent factors that it considers appropriate, including diversity, and believes that the Board should consist of directors who (1) are predominantly independent, (2) are of high integrity, (3) have broad, business-related knowledge and experience at the policy-making level in business or technology, including their understanding of Tesla’s business in particular, (4) have qualifications that will increase overall Board effectiveness, (5) represent diversity of race, ethnicity, gender and professional experience and (6) meet other requirements as may be required by applicable rules, such as financial literacy or financial expertise with respect to Audit Committee members. For example, after conducting independent director searches from time to time in which numerous highly-qualified candidates from a variety of backgrounds were considered, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommended to the 36 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Board Joe Gebbia as director in 2022 and JB Straubel as director nominee in 2023, respectively, to further bolster the Board’s expertise in technological innovation, public company management and sustainability initiatives. • In evaluating and identifying candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has the authority to retain and terminate any third party search firm that is used to identify director candidates and has the authority to approve the fees and retention terms of any search firm. • With regard to any candidates who are properly recommended by stockholders (as described in more detail below) or by other sources, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review the qualifications of any such candidate, which review may, in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s discretion, include interviewing references for the candidate, direct interviews with the candidate or other actions that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee deems necessary or proper. • After completing its review and evaluation of director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends the director nominees that it has determined to be qualified to the full Board. It is the policy of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider properly submitted recommendations for candidates to the Board from stockholders. Stockholder recommendations for candidates to the Board must be directed in writing to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas 78725, Attention: Legal Department, and should also be sent by e-mail to shareholdermail@tesla.com . Such recommendations must include the candidate’s name, home and business contact information, detailed biographical data and qualifications, information regarding any relationships between the candidate and Tesla within the last three years and evidence of the nominating person’s ownership of Tesla stock. Such recommendations must also include a statement from the recommending stockholder in support of the candidate, particularly within the context of the criteria for Board membership, including issues of character, integrity, judgment, diversity, age, independence, skills, education, expertise, business acumen, business experience, length of service, understanding of Tesla’s business, other commitments and the like, as well as any personal references and an indication of the candidate’s willingness to serve. Board Diversity The Board believes that gender and minority representation is a key element in achieving the broad range of perspectives that the Board seeks among its members. As such, diversity is one of the important factors the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers when nominating Board candidates. Two of the four directors we added in the past four years are gender, racially and/or ethnically diverse and the chairperson of our Board is a woman. We believe that such representation promotes a culture of inclusion and diversity at Tesla. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts annual evaluations of our Board effectiveness, providing it with an opportunity to examine whether our Board members have the right composition of skills and experiences. The Board is committed to improving its current diversity, and the Committee continues to consider opportunities, including actively reaching out to diverse candidates, with the objective of increasing our Board diversity in a way that supports the current and anticipated needs of the Company, and of achieving at least 30% gender diversity on our Board. In addition, we mandate external search firms, when applicable, to prioritize searches for candidates with racial, ethnic and/or gender diversity. Board Diversity Matrix (As of April 6, 2023) Female Male Total Number of Directors 8 Gender: Directors 2 6 Number of Directors Who Identify in Any of the Categories Below: African American or Black 1 — Asian (other than South Asian) — 1 White 1 5 Attendance at Annual Meetings of Stockholders by the Board Although Tesla does not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board at Tesla’s annual meetings of stockholders, directors are encouraged to attend. All of our directors who served at the time of the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders attended such meeting, with seven attending in person, and the remaining director joining remotely. Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 37 Table of Contents Stock Transactions Hedging, Short Sales and Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans Tesla has an insider trading policy that prohibits all of our directors, officers and employees from, among other things, engaging in short sales, hedging or similar transactions designed to decrease the risks associated with holding Tesla securities. This prohibition encompasses transactions in publicly-traded options, such as puts and calls, and other derivative securities with respect to Tesla securities, but not transactions designed to facilitate portfolio diversification, such as broad-based index options, futures or baskets. Stock Ownership by Board and Management To align the interests at the highest level of our management with those of our stockholders, the Board has instituted the following requirements relating to stock ownership under our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Each member of the Board and all of our named executive officers are subject to the following minimum stock ownership requirements: (i) each director is required to own shares of Tesla stock equal in value to at least five times the annual cash retainer for directors (regardless of whether or not the retainer has been waived, and exclusive of retainer amounts for service as a member or chair of a Board committee), and (ii) our named executive officers are required to own shares of Tesla stock equal in value to at least six times his/her base salary. Each individual shall have five years from the date such person assumed his or her relevant role at Tesla to come into compliance with these requirements. Each person’s compliance with the minimum stock ownership level will be determined on the date when this compliance grace period expires, and then annually on each December 31, by multiplying the number of shares held by such person and the average closing price of those shares during the preceding month. Our named executive officers and each of our directors is currently either in compliance with these requirements or is in the applicable period to come into compliance therewith. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that no equity award as to which vesting or the lapse of a period of restriction occurs based solely on the passage of time that is granted to a named executive officer may vest, or have a period of restriction that lapses, earlier than six months from the date on which such vesting or lapse commences. Furthermore, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that no named executive officer may sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of any shares of Tesla stock acquired pursuant to any stock option, restricted stock unit or other equity award granted by Tesla earlier than the date that is six months after the date on which such award vests or the period of restriction with respect to such award lapses, as applicable. Prohibition of Equity Award Repricing Tesla views equity-based compensation to be a key factor in incentivizing the future performance of our personnel. Consequently, the Tesla, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “ 2019 Plan ”) provides, and Tesla’s previous 2010 Equity Incentive Plan provided, that stock options and other equity awards issued under these plans that derive their value from the appreciation of the value of Tesla’s stock may not be exchanged for other awards, repurchased for cash or otherwise be made the subject of transactions that have the purpose or effect of repricing such awards. In addition, applicable Nasdaq rules prohibit any repricing with respect to the performance-based stock option award granted to Elon Musk in January 2018.

Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 39 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Compensation Discussion and Analysis The following discussion and analysis of the compensation arrangements of our named executive officers for 2022 should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual amount and form of compensation and the compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from current or planned programs as summarized in this discussion. The following discussion and analysis relates to the compensation arrangements for 2022 of (i) our principal executive officer, (ii) our principal financial officer and (iii) the most highly compensated person, other than our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, who was serving as an executive officer at the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (our “named executive officers”). We had no other executive officers serving at the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Our named executive officers for fiscal year 2022 were: Name Position Elon Musk Technoking of Tesla and Chief Executive Officer Zachary Kirkhorn Master of Coin and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Baglino Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering Compensation Philosophy Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. This is a long-term mission, and our compensation programs reflect this—and our startup origins—in that they consist primarily of salary or wages and equity awards. Whereas salary or wages are intended to meet our employees’ near-term liquidity needs, we believe that equity awards are an effective tool for retaining employees long-term, as they vest incrementally over a period of time or upon the achievement of specified performance milestones intended to be achieved over the medium- and long-term. During periods in which our stock price and the underlying value of equity awards increase, their retention impact is even greater. We believe that the potential for such increases also creates an ownership culture that promotes holding equity, which in turn aligns the interests of our employees with the long-term interests of our stockholders. For these reasons, our goal is to provide each employee with the opportunity to participate in our equity programs, with certain cash-based bonus programs serving generally to accommodate specific incentive structures or liquidity needs. By combining salary or wages and our equity award program, we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets. In particular, we believe that compensation for the individuals who are responsible for Tesla’s strategic direction and operations should motivate them to achieve sustainable stockholder value and/or tangible milestones rather than to simply remain at Tesla or maintain the status quo. Therefore, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, we are increasingly emphasizing for our executive officers the grant of stock option awards, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. In addition, because equity awards comprise a greater proportion of our executive officers’ total level of compensation compared to comparable roles at peer companies, a sustained decrease in our stock price or failure to achieve the applicable operational milestones may result in a level of total compensation that is significantly less than that of such peer roles. Likewise, our outside director compensation program has consisted primarily of equity awards that are entirely in the form of stock option awards, as well as relatively modest cash retainer payments that may be waived at the election of each director. We evaluate our compensation philosophy and programs regularly and evolve them as circumstances merit with oversight by the Compensation Committee, particularly with respect to executive and director compensation. For example, if our stock price experiences significant movement over a short period of time that results in a persistent change to equity compensation, certain adjustments may be considered to align our compensation programs to their intended purposes. 40 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Key Factors in Determining Executive Compensation Role of Compensation Committee in Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee has the overall responsibility of recommending to the Board the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and reviewing and determining the compensation of our other executive officers. Members of the Compensation Committee are appointed by the Board. Currently, the Compensation Committee consists of three members of the Board: Ira Ehrenpreis (Chair), Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, none of whom is an executive officer of Tesla, and each of whom qualifies as (i) an “independent director” under the Nasdaq rules and (ii) an “outside director” under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “ Code ”). See “ Corporate Governance—Board Meetings and Committees—Compensation Committee ” above. Role of Compensation Consultants The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage and has from time to time engaged the services of outside consultants to assist in making decisions regarding the establishment of Tesla’s compensation philosophy and programs, including for executives and directors. For example, Compensia, Inc., a national compensation consulting firm (“ Compensia ”), was retained as a compensation consultant in 2021 to advise the Compensation Committee with respect to Tesla’s compensation program for its non-employee directors. Compensia advised the Compensation Committee on the design of the Board’s equity award program for the future period until the Compensation Committee’s and Board’s next review of the program, including a consideration of Tesla’s exceptional performance and commitment to at-risk director compensation in the form of annual stock option awards to ensure continued alignment of the interests of directors with those of Tesla’s stockholders. See “ Executive Compensation—Compensation of Directors—Non-Employee Director Compensation Arrangements ” below for more detail regarding the review of Board compensation during 2022. Compensia did not provide any services to us in 2022. Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions Historically, for executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought and considered input from our Chief Executive Officer regarding such executive officers’ responsibilities, performance and compensation. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer recommends base salary increases and equity award levels for our senior personnel, and advises the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation program’s ability to attract, retain and motivate executive talent. These recommendations reflect compensation levels that our Chief Executive Officer believes are qualitatively commensurate with an executive officer’s individual qualifications, experience, responsibility level, functional role, knowledge, skills and individual performance, as well as Tesla’s performance. The Compensation Committee considers our Chief Executive Officer’s recommendations, but ultimately determines compensation in its judgment, and approves the specific compensation for all of our executive officers (other than for our Chief Executive Officer, which is approved by the Board). All such compensation determinations by our Compensation Committee are largely discretionary. The Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive session. Our Chief Executive Officer is not present during Compensation Committee deliberations or votes on his compensation and also recuses himself from sessions of the Board where the Board acts on the Compensation Committee’s recommendations regarding his compensation. In addition, the Board has established a management committee under the 2019 Plan (the “ Equity Award Committee ”) to grant and administer equity awards, subject to certain maximum limits on the seniority of personnel to whom the Equity Award Committee may grant awards and the value of any individual award. For example, the Equity Award Committee is not authorized to grant awards to executive officer-level employees. Moreover, pursuant to applicable law, the Equity Award Committee may not grant awards to its members, and the number of shares of our common stock underlying awards granted by it may not exceed amounts determined by the Board from time to time. The Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee oversight authority over the Equity Award Committee. Role of Stockholder Say-on-Pay Votes At the 2011 annual meeting of our stockholders and at each annual meeting held every three years since, including most recently in 2020, we held triennial stockholder advisory “say-on-pay” votes on the compensation of our named executive officers for the immediately preceding fiscal years. At our 2020 annual meeting, our stockholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 83% of our stockholders present and entitled to vote at the meeting voting in favor of our compensation policies for our named executive officers. Given these results, the Compensation Committee has decided to retain our overall approach to executive compensation while continuing to Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 41 Table of Contents evaluate our practices frequently, including in response to future say-on-pay votes. Moreover, we are required to hold a vote at least every six years regarding how often to hold a stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. We held our most recent such vote at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, at which our stockholders indicated a preference for a triennial vote. In accordance with this triennial frequency, we will again hold a say-on-pay advisory vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting. See “ Proposal Two— Tesla Proposal for Non-Binding Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation. ” We will also hold our say-on-pay frequency vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting. See “ Proposal Three— Tesla Proposal for Non-Binding Advisory Vote on the Frequency of the Future Non-Binding Vote on Executive Compensation. ” Clawback Policy Our Corporate Governance Guidelines sets forth a compensation recovery (“ clawback ”) policy with respect to any annual incentive payment or long-term incentive payment that may be received by an executive officer, where such payment would be predicated upon achieving certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement of our financial statements, and a lower payment would have been made to the executive based upon the restated financial results. In such case, the Board has the authority to seek to recover from the executive officer the amount by which such officer’s incentive payments for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results. Moreover, the terms of the 2018 CEO Performance Award include a clawback provision in the event of a restatement of our financial statements previously filed with the SEC. See “ Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief Executive Officer Compensation—2018 CEO Performance Award ” below. Current Elements of Named Executive Officer Compensation Overview and Fiscal Year 2022 Company Highlights Our current executive compensation program, which was developed and approved by the Compensation Committee, generally consists of base salary and equity-based incentives, as well as other benefits generally available to employees. We combine these elements in order to formulate compensation packages with the goal of providing, on a total basis, competitive pay and align the interests of our named executive officers with long-term stockholder interests by tying the value of their compensation to our long-term stock price and/or the achievement of financial, operational and strategic objectives. In 2022, Tesla’s full-year accomplishments under our executive leadership included the following: • Total revenues of $81.46 billion, representing an increase of $27.64 billion, or 51.4% , compared to the prior year; • Net income attributable to common stockholders of $12.56 billion and an operating margin of 16.8%, representing favorable changes of $7.04 billion and 4.6%, respectively, compared to the prior year; • Annual vehicle delivery and production records of 1,313,851 and 1,369,611 total vehicles, representing an increase of 40.3% and 47.2%, respectively, compared to the prior year; • 6.5 gigawatt hours of energy storage and 348 megawatts of solar energy systems deployed; and • Ongoing progress in the global growth of our manufacturing capabilities, including production and ramp at Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and our Megafactory in Lathrop, CA. Base Salary The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing our Chief Executive Officer’s and other executive officers’ base salaries. The base salaries of all executive officers are reviewed and adjusted when necessary to reflect individual roles, performance and the competitive market. Because we currently do not provide cash bonuses to our executive officers, salary is the primary cash-based element of our executive officers’ compensation structure. 42 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents The following table sets forth information regarding the annualized base salary rates at the end of 2022 for our named executive officers: Name 2022 Fiscal Year-End Base Salary($)(1) Elon Musk — (2) Zachary Kirkhorn 300,000 Andrew Baglino 300,000 (1) Reflects an annualized rate assuming 52 weeks each consisting of five work days. (2) Mr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Equity-Based Incentives Our equity award program is the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our named executive officers. The equity awards we have historically granted and currently grant are options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock unit awards that are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting. We have granted to our named executive officers both awards that vest over a long-term period and awards that vest only upon the achievement of specified Tesla performance milestones, in each case subject to continued service. We are increasingly emphasizing the grant of stock option awards for our named executive officers, which have value only to the extent, if any, that our stock price increases following their grant. Accordingly, all equity awards granted to our named executive officers in 2020 (the last year awards were granted to any of our named executive officers) were in the form of stock option awards. As a result, a significant portion of our named executive officers’ total compensation is entirely at risk, depending on long-term stock price performance. While we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets, we do not have a rigid set of criteria for granting equity awards; instead, the Compensation Committee exercises its judgment and discretion, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer and from time to time, a compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee considers, among other things, the role and responsibility of the named executive officer, competitive market factors, the amount of stock-based equity compensation already held by the named executive officer, the impact of any dramatic changes in our stock price over a short period of time and the cash-based compensation received by the named executive officer, to determine the level and types of equity awards that it approves. We generally grant one-time new hire equity awards to our employees, including executives, upon their commencement of employment with us, or upon their promotion to a new position. Additionally, as part of our ongoing executive compensation review and alignment process, we periodically grant additional equity awards to our executives, although no such equity awards were granted in fiscal 2022. See “ Executive Compensation—Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022 ” below. The Compensation Committee meets periodically, including to approve equity award grants to our executives from time to time. We do not have, nor do we plan to establish, any program, plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with releasing material non-public information. Severance and Change in Control Benefits No named executive officer has a severance or change in control arrangement with Tesla. Bonus We do not currently have or have planned, and historically we have rarely entered into, any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for cash-based bonus awards. Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 43 Table of Contents Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation We did not provide any non-equity incentive plan compensation to any of our named executive officers in 2022, and we do not currently have or have planned any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for non-equity incentive plan compensation. Perquisites Generally, we do not provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers. Health and Welfare Benefits We provide the following benefits to our named executive officers on the same basis provided to all of our employees: • medical insurance including comprehensive transgender and fertility coverage, mental health, dental and vision; • adoption and surrogacy benefits; • confidential Employee Assistance Program counseling; • life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance; • a Section 401(k) plan where, beginning in 2022, Tesla provides a company match equal to 50% of the employee’s contribution, up to a maximum of 3% of the employee’s eligible compensation with a $3,000 annual cap; • an employee stock purchase plan; • short-and long-term disability insurance; • medical and dependent care flexible spending account; and • a health savings account. Chief Executive Officer Compensation Overview Historically, in developing compensation recommendations for our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought both to appropriately reward our Chief Executive Officer’s previous and current contributions and to create incentives for our Chief Executive Officer to continue to contribute significantly to successful results in the future. Each of the 2018 CEO Performance Award and the performance-based stock option award granted to our Chief Executive Officer in August 2012 (the “ 2012 CEO Performance Award ”) was focused on this latter objective, as it solely rewards future performance. In addition to serving as our Chief Executive Officer since October 2008, Elon Musk has contributed significantly and actively to Tesla since our earliest days in April 2004 by recruiting executives and engineers, contributing to vehicle engineering and design, raising capital for us, bringing investors to us and raising our public awareness. Cash Compensation Mr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Historical Equity Compensation Prior to stock option awards made in December 2009, Mr. Musk did not receive any equity compensation for his services for a period of five years. In 2010 and 2011, Mr. Musk did not receive any equity grants, because the Compensation Committee believed his grants made in December 2009 already provided sufficient motivation for Mr. Musk to perform his duties as Chief Executive Officer. In August 2012, to create incentives for continued long-term success from the then-recently launched Model S program as well as from Tesla’s then-planned Model X and Model 3 programs, and to further align executive compensation with 44 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents increases in stockholder value, the Board granted to Mr. Musk the 2012 CEO Performance Award, comprised of a stock option award to purchase 79,123,515 shares (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split) of Tesla’s common stock, representing 5% of Tesla’s total issued and outstanding shares at the time of grant. The 2012 CEO Performance Award consisted of 10 equal vesting tranches, each requiring that Tesla meet a combination of (i) the achievement of a specified operational milestone relating to development of Model X or Model 3, aggregate vehicle production or a gross margin target, and (ii) a sustained incremental $4 billion increase in Tesla’s market capitalization from $3.2 billion, Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of grant. Prior to its expiration in 2022, the market capitalization conditions for all of the 10 vesting tranches and nine of the 10 operational milestones had been achieved, and nine of 10 tranches under the 2012 CEO Performance Award vested. Prior to 2018, the only additional equity awards received by Mr. Musk related to certain immaterial awards granted during 2013 pursuant to a patent incentive program that was available to our employees generally. 2018 CEO Performance Award Early in 2017, with the 2012 CEO Performance Award heading to substantial completion after having helped Tesla grow its market capitalization to over $55 billion in just over five years, the independent members of the Board began preliminary discussions regarding how to continue to incentivize Mr. Musk to lead Tesla through the next phase of its development. In January 2018, following more than six months of careful analysis and development led by the Compensation Committee, with participation by every independent Board member, the help of Compensia and engagement with and feedback from our largest institutional stockholders, the Board granted the 2018 CEO Performance Award to Mr. Musk. Such grant was subject to approval by a majority of the total votes of Tesla common stock not owned by Mr. Musk or Kimbal Musk cast at a meeting of the stockholders to approve the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On March 21, 2018, such approval was obtained, with approximately 73% of the votes cast by such disinterested shares voting in favor of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The 2018 CEO Performance Award was comprised of a 10-year maximum term stock option to purchase 303,960,630 shares (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split) of Tesla’s common stock, divided equally among 12 separate tranches that were each equivalent to 1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Tesla’s common stock at the time of grant, at an exercise price of $23.34 per share (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split). Each of the 12 tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which began at $100 billion for the first tranche and increased by increments of $50 billion thereafter and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on revenue or eight operational milestones focused on profitability, was met: Total Revenue* (in billions) Adjusted EBITDA** (in billions) $20.0 $ 1.5 $35.0 $ 3.0 $55.0 $ 4.5 $75.0 $ 6.0 $100.0 $ 8.0 $125.0 $ 10.0 $150.0 $ 12.0 $175.0 $ 14.0 * “Revenue” means total revenues as reported in Tesla’s financial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters. ** “Adjusted EBITDA” means (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii) interest expense, (iii) (benefit) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization and (v) stock-based compensation, as each such item is reported in Tesla’s financial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters. Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 45 Table of Contents Any single operational milestone could only satisfy the vesting requirement of one tranche, together with the corresponding market capitalization milestone. Subject to any applicable clawback provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms, once a milestone was achieved, it was forever deemed achieved for purposes of determining the vesting of a tranche. Meeting more than 12 of the 16 operational milestones does not result in any additional vesting or other compensation to Mr. Musk under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Except in a change in control situation, measurement of the market capitalization milestones was based on both (i) a six calendar month trailing average of Tesla’s stock price as well as (ii) a 30 calendar day trailing average of Tesla’s stock price, in each case based on trading days only. Upon the consummation of certain acquisitions or split-up, spin-off or divestiture transactions, each then-unachieved market capitalization milestone and/or operational milestone would have been adjusted to offset the impact of such transactions to the extent they had been considered material to the achievement of those milestones. In establishing the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA milestones, the Board carefully considered a variety of factors, including Tesla’s growth trajectory and internal growth plans and the historical performance of other high-growth and high-multiples companies in the technology space that have invested in new businesses and tangible assets. These benchmarks provided revenue/EBITDA to market capitalization multiples, which were then used to inform the specific operational targets that aligned with Tesla’s plans for future growth. Nevertheless, the Board considered each of the market capitalization and operational milestones to be challenging hurdles. For example, in order to meet all 12 market capitalization milestones, Tesla was required to add approximately $600 billion to its market capitalization at the time of the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award on a sustained basis, and in order to satisfy all eight revenue-based operational milestones, Tesla would have to increase revenue by more than $163 billion from its annual revenue of approximately $11.8 billion in 2017, the last fiscal year completed prior to the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. In addition, Mr. Musk was required to continue leading Tesla as our Chief Executive Officer or, alternatively, as our Chief Product Officer and Executive Chairman (with any other Chief Executive Officer reporting directly to him), at the time each milestone was met in order for the corresponding tranche to vest. With limited exceptions, Mr. Musk must hold any shares that he acquires upon exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for at least five years post-exercise. There would have been no acceleration of vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance award upon Mr. Musk’s termination, death or disability or a change in control of Tesla. However, in a change in control situation, the achievement of the milestones would have been based solely on the market capitalization milestones, with the measurement of Tesla’s market capitalization determined by the product of the total number of outstanding shares of Tesla common stock immediately before the change in control multiplied by the greater of the last closing price of a share of Tesla common stock before the effective time of the change in control or the per share price (plus the per share value of any other consideration) received by Tesla’s stockholders in the change in control. In the event of a restatement of Tesla’s financial statements previously filed with the SEC, if a lesser portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have vested based on the restated financial results, then Tesla will require forfeiture (or repayment, as applicable) of the portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award that would not have vested based on the restated financial results (less any amounts Mr. Musk may have paid to Tesla in exercising any forfeited awards). The 2018 CEO Performance Award is subject, if more stringent than the foregoing, to any current or future Tesla clawback policy applicable to equity awards, provided that the policy does not discriminate solely against Mr. Musk except as required by applicable law. As of the date of this filing, all of the milestones have been achieved and certified by our Board. Consequently, all 12 of the 12 tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, corresponding to options to purchase an aggregate 303,960,630 shares of Tesla’s common stock, have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk’s payment of the exercise price of $23.34 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise. Realized Compensation For purposes of the table in “ Executive Compensation—Summary Compensation Table ” below, we are required to report pursuant to applicable SEC rules any stock option grants to Mr. Musk at values determined as of their respective grant dates and which are driven by certain assumptions prescribed by Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, “ Compensation–Stock Compensation ” (“ ASC Topic 718 ”). Moreover, we are required to report in “ Executive Compensation—Pay Ratio Disclosure ” below (i) Mr. Musk’s annual total compensation, (ii) the median of the annual total compensation of all Tesla employees qualifying for this analysis, other than Mr. Musk, in each case calculated pursuant to the methodology used for the table in “ Executive Compensation—Summary Compensation Table, ” and (iii) the ratio of the former to the latter. 46 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents In addition, we are required to report in “ Executive Compensation—2022 Option Exercises and Stock Vested ” below an amount for the “value realized” upon: (i) any exercise by Mr. Musk of a stock option, which is based on the difference between the market price of the underlying shares at the time of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option and (ii) any vesting of a restricted stock unit award, based on the market price of the award at the time of vesting. Such amount is required to be reported even if Mr. Musk does not actually receive any cash from such exercise or vesting, either because he does not also sell any shares or because he sells only a number of shares sufficient to cover the related tax liabilities resulting from the exercise or vesting. As a result, there may be a significant disconnect between what is reported as compensation for Mr. Musk in a given year in such sections and the value actually realized as compensation in that year or over a period of time. Moreover, the vast majority of compensation in respect of past stock option grants to Mr. Musk, including the 2012 CEO Performance Award and the 2018 CEO Performance Award, were structured to be incentives for future performance with their value realizable only if Tesla’s stock price appreciated compared to the dates of the grants, and if the Company achieved applicable vesting requirements. To supplement the disclosures in “ Executive Compensation—Summary Compensation Table, ” “ Executive Compensation—Pay Ratio Disclosure ” and “ Executive Compensation—2022 Option Exercises and Stock Vested ” below, we have included the following table, which shows the total realized compensation of Mr. Musk for the last three fiscal years, as well as the ratio of Mr. Musk’s realized compensation to the median of the annual total compensation of all other Tesla employees qualifying for this analysis as reported in “ Executive Compensation—Pay Ratio Disclosure. ” Realized compensation is not a substitute for reported compensation in evaluating our compensation structure, but we believe that realized compensation is an important factor in understanding that the value of compensation that Mr. Musk ultimately realizes is dependent on a number of additional factors, including: (i) the vesting of certain of his option awards only upon the successful achievement of a number of market capitalization increase and operational milestone targets; (ii) the fact that Mr. Musk does not receive any cash if he does not actually sell shares and thereby reduce his investment in us, and he does not receive any cash to the extent that he sells only shares sufficient to cover income taxes with respect to his awards (including stock options exercised solely to avoid their expiration in accordance with their terms); and (iii) the then-current market value of our common stock at the times at which Mr. Musk may elect to actually sell his shares.

Of the shares received upon exercise, 42.0% were immediately sold in order to pay federal and state tax withholding from the option exercise and none of the proceeds from such sales were retained by Mr. Musk. Of the remaining shares, 94.6% were retained by Mr. Musk. The other 5.4% automatically were sold as a result of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan put in place in September 2021. Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 47 Table of Contents Tax and Accounting Considerations Sections 280G and 409A . We have not provided or committed to provide any executive officer or director with a gross-up or other reimbursement for tax amounts the executive might pay pursuant to Section 280G or Section 409A of the Code. Section 280G and related Code sections provide that executive officers, directors who hold significant stockholder interests and certain other service providers could be subject to significant additional taxes if they receive payments or benefits in connection with a change in control of Tesla that exceeds certain limits, and that we or our successor could lose a deduction on the amounts subject to the additional tax. Section 409A also imposes additional significant taxes on the individual in the event that an executive officer, director or service provider of certain types receives “deferred compensation” that does not meet the requirements of Section 409A. Tax Deduction Limit . Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation greater than $1,000,000 paid in any fiscal year to certain executive officers. However, prior to the enactment of U.S. tax legislation in December 2017 (the “ Tax Act ”), certain types of performance-based compensation were excluded from the $1,000,000 deduction limit if specific requirements were met. Under the Tax Act, this exclusion for performance-based compensation is not available with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, unless the compensation is pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on or before November 2, 2017, and which is not modified in any material respect on or after such date. Pursuant to the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Code was expanded to cover additional executive officers and other employees, including the chief financial officer, so that the compensation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer (at any time during the fiscal year), the three next most highly compensated executive officers during the taxable year and any other individual who was considered a “covered employee” for any prior taxable year that begins after 2016, will be subject to the $1,000,000 deductibility limit under Section 162(m) of the Code. Commencing with our 2018 fiscal year, to the extent that the aggregate amount of any covered officer’s salary, bonus, any amount realized from certain option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units or other equity awards, and certain other compensation amounts that are recognized as taxable income by the officer exceeds $1,000,000, we will not be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax deduction for the amount over $1,000,000 in that year, unless the compensation qualifies for the transition relief applicable to certain written binding contracts in effect on or before November 2, 2017. The Compensation Committee has not adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to our executive officers and reserves the right to pay compensation that may not be deductible to Tesla i f it determines that doing so would be in the best interests of Tesla. Accounting Implications . We follow ASC Topic 718 for our stock-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on the grant date “fair value” of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our named executive officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award. Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee oversees Tesla’s compensation programs, policies and practices. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement. Respectfully submitted by the members of the Compensation Committee of the Board Ira Ehrenpreis (Chair) Robyn Denholm Kathleen Wilson-Thompson 48 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Summary Compensation Table The following table presents information concerning the total compensation of our named executive officers for each of the last three fiscal years.

The assumptions used in the valuation of these awards are set forth in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on January 31, 2023. These amounts do not necessarily correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by the named executive officers, which depends, among other things, on the market value of our common stock appreciating from that on the grant date(s) of the option(s). (2) Reflects matching contributions made under the Tesla 401(k) Plan based on each of the named executive officer’s fiscal 2022 contributions. (3) Reflects a temporary reduction to base salary in response to global market conditions. (4) Reflects an amount corresponding to previously-accrued paid time off that was applied toward the purchase of a Tesla vehicle pursuant to a company-wide program. Pay Ratio Disclosure Tesla is committed to fair and competitive compensation for our employees. Moreover, Elon Musk, the Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to a compensation arrangement in the 2018 CEO Performance Award that is substantially tied to the appreciation of our market capitalization. Because equity awards are generally made available to Tesla employees, this also means that Mr. Musk’s compensation is tied to the success of Tesla employees. We are providing a ratio of (i) Mr. Musk’s 2022 annual total compensation to (ii) the median of the 2022 annual total compensation of all applicable qualifying Tesla employees other than Mr. Musk, in each case calculated pursuant to the disclosure requirements of “ Executive Compensation—Summary Compensation Table ” above. As we continue our international expansion, the median annual total compensation of our employees reflects differences in local compensation scales and practices abroad to a greater extent. Mr. Musk’s 2022 annual total compensation, as reported in “ Executive Compensation—Summary Compensation Table, ” was $0, and the median 2022 annual total compensation of all other qualifying employees, as determined pursuant to the methodology set forth below, was $34,084. Consequently, the applicable ratio of such amounts for 2022 was 0.00:1. Our methodology for identifying the median of the 2022 annual total compensation for each individual other than Mr. Musk was as follows: • We selected December 31, 2022, which is within the last three months of 2022, as the date upon which we would identify the “median employee” because it enabled us to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner. • We determined that as of December 31, 2022, Tesla and all our subsidiaries had 126,771 individuals qualifying for this analysis (full-time, part-time and temporary employees other than Mr. Musk, subject to the following bullet), of which approximately 44% were based outside of the U.S. and approximately 42% were production line employees. Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 49 Table of Contents • We did not include in the population of qualifying individuals any employees of staffing agencies whose compensation is determined by such agencies. • We applied the requirements and assumptions required for the table in “ Executive Compensation—Summary Compensation Table ” for each of such individuals to calculate the total annual compensation, including base salary or wages, performance-based commission payments, and equity awards based on their grant date fair values. • We converted any payment earned or paid in a foreign currency to U.S. dollar using the average of the prevailing conversion rates for the month of December 2022. • We selected the median of all total annual compensation amounts calculated in accordance with the foregoing. Pay Versus Performance In accordance with Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are required to disclose certain information about the relationship between the compensation actually paid to our named executive officers and certain measures of company performance.

(8) In the Company’s assessment, revenue is the financial performance measure that is the most important financial performance measure (other than total shareholder return and net income) used by the Company for the most recently completed fiscal year, to link compensation actually paid to performance. (9) Mr. Guillen departed Tesla in June 2021, which led to certain forfeitures of unvested awards. The average compensation actually paid in 2021 to our NEOs other than our CEO and Mr. Guillen was approximately $123.2 million. Most Important Financial Performance Measures This list below includes the three financial measures that in our assessment represent the most important financial performance measures used to link compensation actually paid to our NEOs, for the most recently completed fiscal year, to the Company’s performance. See “ Compensation Discussion and Analysis ” for further details. Revenue Adjusted EBITDA Market Capitalization Description of Relationships Between Compensation Actually Paid and Performance Chief Executive Officer From 2021 to 2022, compensation actually paid to the CEO decreased by 164.6%. Over this same period, TSR decreased by 65.0%, net income increased by 123.0%, and revenue increased by 51.4%. From 2020 to 2021, compensation actually paid to the CEO decreased by 65.1%. Over this same period, TSR increased by 49.8%, net income increased by 554.8%, and revenue increased by 70.7%. Mr. Musk does not earn a base salary or receive any equity compensation other than under his 2012 CEO Performance Award and 2018 CEO Performance Award. See “ Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief Executive Officer Compensation ” for more information. The vesting of Mr. Musk’s awards were tied to specific market capitalization and operational milestones focusing on total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. However, the compensation actually paid as calculated pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K is based on the accounting changes in the fair value of such options, which varies significantly with the performance of our common stock. Thus, because the Company TSR is calculated from the beginning of the earliest year presented, a positive TSR does not necessarily correlate to an increase in compensation actually paid if the increase in TSR is less significant relative to a prior year. In addition, due to the fact that Mr. Musk did not receive any additional equity grants following the 2018 CEO Performance Award, his amount of total compensation actually paid decreased because the number of unvested options decreased year over year upon the vesting of tranches of the award. Because the 2018 CEO Performance Award has fully vested, Mr. Musk’s compensation actually paid will converge to $0 unless he receives a new grant. 5 2 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents While a positive TSR may not align with an increase in compensation actually paid, as further demonstrated by the following graph, any decreases in TSR would align to decreases in compensation actually paid. Other NEOs From 2021 to 2022, compensation actually paid to the other NEOs decreased by 122.5%. Over this same period, TSR decreased by 65.0%, net income increased by 123.0%, and revenue increased by 51.4%. From 2020 to 2021, compensation actually paid to the other NEOs decreased by 118.9%. Over this same period, TSR increased by 49.8%, net income increased by 554.8%, and revenue increased by 70.7%. Though our other NEOs do receive a base salary, a significant portion of their compensation actually paid consists of equity awards. As the compensation actually paid as calculated pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, is based on the accounting changes in the fair value of such options, the value varies significantly with the performance of our common stock. Thus, because the Company TSR is calculated from the beginning of the earliest year presented, a positive TSR does not necessarily correlate to an increase in compensation actually paid if the increase in TSR is less significant relative to a prior year. In addition, due to the fact that our other NEOs did not receive any additional equity grants after 2020, their amount of total compensation actually paid decreased because the number of unvested options decreased year over year. From 2020 to 2021, some of the decrease in compensation actually paid to our other NEOs was a result of Jerome Guillen’s departure in June 2021, which led to certain forfeitures of unvested awards. Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 53 Table of Contents While a positive TSR may not align with an increase in compensation actually paid, as further demonstrated by the following graph, any decreases in TSR would align with decreases in compensation actually paid.

Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 57 Table of Contents Non-Employee Director Compensation Arrangements Overview and Philosophy The compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has consisted of cash retainer payments that are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each director. Consequently, a large portion and in some cases, the entirety, of each of our non-employee directors’ compensation is entirely at risk, and fluctuating stock prices have at times resulted in 100% of the vested stock options then held by each of our non-employee directors being out-of-the-money. In 2020 and 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Director Compensation Policy with the aid of Compensia and in light of Tesla’s exceptional performance and commitment to at-risk director compensation in the form of annual stock option awards to ensure continued alignment of the interests of directors with those of Tesla’s stockholders. Following such review, the Compensation Committee recommended that the Board approve a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic grants of annual stock option awards under the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise previously approved by the Board until July 2022 unless the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution. In June 2021, the Board unanimously approved and adopted this resolution and in May 2022, the Board agreed to further forego the Board Stock Option Grants until July 2023 unless the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution. The Compensation Committee intends to make further recommendations with respect to the Board’s compensation program for directors, if any, who join the Board after the date of this resolution, as well as for future periods of service by existing directors, following further periodic reviews. Other Information If, following a change in control of Tesla, the service of a non-employee director is terminated, all stock options granted to the director shall fully vest and become immediately exercisable. Non-employee directors may also have their travel, lodging and related expenses associated with attending Board or Board committee meetings reimbursed by Tesla. Pledging of Shares The ability of our directors and executive officers to pledge Tesla stock for personal loans and investments is inherently related to their compensation due to our use of equity awards and promotion of long-termism and an ownership culture. Moreover, providing these individuals flexibility in financial planning without having to rely on the sale of shares aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. In order to mitigate the risk of forced sales of pledged shares, the Board has a policy that limits pledging of Tesla stock by our directors and executive officers. Pursuant to this policy, directors and executive officers may pledge their stock (exclusive of options, warrants, restricted stock units or other rights to purchase stock) as collateral for loans and investments, provided that the maximum aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by such pledged stock does not exceed, (i) with respect to our CEO, the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock, or (ii) with respect to our directors and officers other than our CEO, fifteen percent (15%) of the total value of the pledged stock. Example: A director (other than our CEO) pledges 1,000 shares as collateral for a loan, and the current stock price is $800 per share. The director may borrow up to 15% of 1,000 x $800, or $120,000, against such shares. If the stock price later increases to $1,600 per share, the director may borrow up to an additional $120,000 against the pledged shares. If the director borrows the full allowable amount of $240,000 and the stock price then decreases to $1,200, the director must repay $60,000 to maintain compliance with the 15% limit under the pledging policy. 58 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents See “ Ownership of Securities ” below for information regarding any shares pledged by our directors or executive officers as of March 31, 2023; however, such pledging does not indicate the extent to which there may be actual borrowings against such shares as of such date, which may be substantially less than the value of the shares pledged. As of December 31, 2022, based on written representations of our directors and executive officers to the Company, the aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by our directors and executive officers’ pledged shares was less than 1% of the total value of the pledged shares. We require our directors and executive officers to make written representations, at least annually, that he or she is in compliance with our pledging policy. If a director or executive officer wishes to take a loan collateralized by pledged stock, Tesla management works with the director or executive officer during the original loan approval, and subsequently monitors compliance with this policy by regularly reviewing and requesting updates from the applicable director or executive officer on his or her pledged stock amount and loan amount. If necessary, Tesla management will report to the Board or its committees the extent to which any officer or director has pledged shares of Company stock. We believe that this monitoring is effective and includes appropriate controls, and we have confirmed that each of our directors and executive officers who have pledged stock are and have been compliant with this policy since our last confirmation. Equity Compensation Plan Information The following table summarizes the number of securities underlying outstanding options, stock awards, warrants and rights granted to employees and directors, as well as the number of securities remaining available for future issuance, under Tesla’s equity compensation awards as of December 31, 2022.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into offer letters with our executive officers. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers. The indemnification agreements and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In relation to our CEO’s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate amount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 to indemnify the Company for additional taxes owed, if any. 60 Tesla, Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents DELINQUENT SECTION 16(a) REPORTS Under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, Tesla’s directors, executive officers and any persons holding more than 10% of the Tesla’s common stock are required to report initial ownership of the Tesla common stock and any subsequent changes in ownership to the SEC. Specific due dates have been established by the SEC, and Tesla is required to disclose in this proxy statement any failure to file required ownership reports by these dates. Based solely upon a review of forms filed with the SEC and the written representations of such persons, Tesla is aware of no late Section 16(a) filings other than one late Form 4 report filed by Andrew Baglino, reporting an exercise of options and subsequent sales pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan, due to an administrative delay by Tesla.

In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of common stock subject to options or other convertible securities held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of March 31, 2023.
