The enclosed proxy is solicited by the Board of Directors of NIKE, Inc. (“NIKE” or the “Company”) for use at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on September 21, 2017, and at any adjournment thereof (the “Annual Meeting”).  Our principal executive offices are located at One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. This proxy statement is first being made available to shareholders on or about August 4, 2017. Shareholders may submit a proxy to vote at the Annual Meeting by following the instructions on the Notice, via the Internet, by telephone, or (if they have received paper copies of the proxy materials) by returning a proxy card. The Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies.

A shareholder giving the enclosed proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before it is exercised by affirmatively electing to vote in person at the meeting or by delivering to Ann M. Miller, Vice President and Corporate Secretary of NIKE, either an instrument of revocation or an executed proxy bearing a later date. Voting Securities and Vote Required Holders of record of NIKE’s Class A Common Stock (“Class A Stock”) and holders of record of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock (“Class B Stock”) at the close of business on July 21, 2017 will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On that date, 329,245,752 shares of Class A Stock and 1,312,148,057 shares of Class B Stock were issued and outstanding. Neither class of Common Stock has cumulative voting rights. Each share of Class A Stock and each share of Class B Stock is entitled to one vote on every matter submitted to the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. A majority of the votes entitled to be cast on Proposal 1, the election of directors, by each of the Class A Stock and Class B Stock separately constitutes a quorum of Class A Stock and Class B Stock, respectively, for action on Proposal 1.  The holders of Class A Stock and the holders of Class B Stock will vote separately on Proposal 1. Holders of Class B Stock are currently entitled to elect 25 percent of the total Board, rounded up to the next whole number. Holders of Class A Stock are currently entitled to elect the remaining directors. Under this formula, holders of Class B Stock, voting separately, will elect three directors, and holders of Class A Stock, voting separately, will elect eight directors.  Under Oregon law, if a quorum of each class of common stock is present at the meeting, the three director nominees who receive the greatest number of votes cast by holders of Class B Stock and the eight director nominees who receive the greatest number of votes cast by holders of Class A Stock will be elected directors. A majority of the votes entitled to be cast on Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 by both Class A Stock and Class B Stock together constitutes a quorum for action on those proposals. Holders of Class A Stock and holders of Class B Stock will vote together as one class on Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. If a quorum is present at the meeting, Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be approved if the votes cast in favor of the proposal exceeds the votes cast against the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.  Abstentions and broker non-votes are not included as votes cast and will not affect the outcome of any of the proposals. Broker non-votes occur when a person holding shares in street name, such as through a brokerage firm, does not provide instructions as to how to vote those shares and the broker does not then vote those shares on the shareholder’s behalf. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 1 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Board of Directors CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Board of Directors The Board of Directors is currently composed of nine independent directors and three directors who are not independent under the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) listing rules. During fiscal 2017, there were five meetings of the Board and all directors attended at least 75 percent of the total number of meetings of the Board and committees on which he or she served. The Company encourages all directors to attend each annual meeting of shareholders, and all directors serving at the time of the 2016 annual meeting attended the 2016 annual meeting. Board Committees The Board’s current standing committees are an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a Finance Committee, a Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee, and an Executive Committee.  The Board may also appoint other committees from time to time. Each standing committee has a written charter; all such charters, as well as the Company’s corporate governance guidelines, are available at the Company’s corporate website: http://investors.nike.com and will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. The Executive Committee is authorized to act on behalf of the Board on all corporate actions for which applicable law does not require participation by the full Board. In practice, the Executive Committee acts in place of the full Board only when emergency issues or scheduling conflicts make it difficult or impracticable to assemble the full Board. All actions taken by the Executive Committee must be reported at the next Board meeting. The Executive Committee held no formal meetings during fiscal 2017, but took action pursuant to written consent resolutions. The Audit Committee is responsible for the engagement or discharge of the independent registered public accountants, reviews and approves services provided by the independent registered public accountants, and reviews with the independent registered public accountants the scope and results of their annual audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and any recommendations they may have. The Audit Committee also reviews the Company’s procedures with respect to maintaining books and records, the adequacy and implementation of internal auditing, accounting, disclosure, and financial controls, the Company’s policies concerning financial reporting and business practices, and the Company’s information security and data protection procedures. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee meets all applicable independence and financial literacy requirements under the NYSE listing standards and applicable regulations adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Board has also determined that Mr. Alan B. Graf, Jr. is an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in regulations adopted by the SEC. The Compensation Committee evaluates the performance of the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), reviews the performance evaluations of our other Named Executive Officers, and recommends their compensation for approval by the independent members of the Board (other than the incentive compensation approved solely by the Compensation Committee as described below). The Compensation Committee also grants equity incentive awards under the NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan, and determines targets and awards under the NIKE, Inc. Executive Performance Sharing Plan and the NIKE, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Committee also makes recommendations to the Board regarding other executive incentive compensation arrangements and profit sharing plan contributions. The Board has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee meets all applicable independence requirements under the NYSE listing standards. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies individuals qualified to become Board members, recommends director nominees for election at each annual shareholder meeting, and develops and recommends corporate governance guidelines and standards for business conduct and ethics. The Committee also oversees the annual self-evaluations of the Board and its committees and makes recommendations to the Board concerning the structure and membership of the other Board committees. The Board has determined that each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets all applicable independence requirements under the NYSE listing standards. The Finance Committee reviews the Company’s annual operating budget and recommends approval of the budget to the Board, considers long-term financing options, long-range tax, financial regulatory and foreign currency issues facing the Company, and management recommendations concerning capital deployment strategy, major capital expenditures and material acquisitions or divestitures. The Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee reviews significant strategies, activities and policies regarding sustainability (including labor practices), community impact and charitable activities, and makes recommendations regarding the same to the Board. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 2 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Board of Directors The table below provides information regarding the current membership of each standing Board committee and meetings held during fiscal 2017: Director Name Audit Compensation Nominating and Corporate Governance Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Finance Executive Elizabeth J. Comstock ü ü John G. Connors ü Chair Timothy D. Cook* Chair ü John J. Donahoe II ü ü ü Alan B. Graf, Jr. Chair ü Travis A. Knight ü ü John C. Lechleiter ü Chair ü Mark G. Parker** Chair Michelle A.

Wise ü Chair Meetings in Fiscal 2017 14 5 5 5 5 - * Effective June 30, 2016, Mr. Cook was appointed Lead Independent Director of the Board. ** Effective June 30, 2016, Mr. Parker was appointed Chairman of the Board and Chair of the Executive Committee. Director Independence Pursuant to NYSE rules, in order for a director to qualify as “independent,” the Board of Directors must affirmatively determine that the director has no material relationship with the Company that would impair the director’s independence. The Board affirmatively determined that commercial or charitable relationships below the following thresholds will not be considered material relationships that impair a director’s independence: (i) if a NIKE director or immediate family member is an executive officer of another company that does business with NIKE and the annual sales to, or purchases from, NIKE are less than one percent of the annual revenues of the other company; and (ii) if a NIKE director or immediate family member serves as an officer, director or trustee of a charitable organization, and NIKE’s contributions to the organization are less than one percent of that organization’s total annual charitable receipts. After applying this categorical standard, the Board has determined that the following directors who served during fiscal 2017 - Elizabeth J. Comstock, John G. Connors, Timothy D. Cook, John J. Donahoe II, Alan B. Graf, Jr., John C. Lechleiter, Michelle A. Peluso, Johnathan A. Rodgers, and Phyllis M. Wise - have no material relationship with the Company and, therefore, are independent. Messrs. Knight, Parker, and Thompson were not independent pursuant to NYSE rules. Mr. Parker was not independent pursuant to NYSE rules because he was an executive officer of the Company during fiscal 2017. Mr. Travis Knight was not independent pursuant to NYSE rules because he is the son of NIKE’s co-founder and former Chairman of the Board, Mr. Philip Knight, who was an executive officer of the Company and currently serves as Chairman Emeritus. Mr. Thompson was not independent pursuant to NYSE rules because the Company has a contract with his son, John Thompson III, who was head basketball coach at Georgetown University during fiscal 2017, to provide endorsement and consulting services to the Company. The compensation paid to Messrs. Philip Knight and John Thompson III is described under “Transactions with Related Persons” below. Director Nominations The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies potential director candidates through a variety of means, including recommendations from members of the Committee or the Board, suggestions from Company management, and shareholder recommendations. The Committee also may, in its discretion, engage director search firms to identify candidates. Shareholders may recommend director candidates for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee by submitting a written recommendation to the Committee, c/o Ann M. Miller, Vice President and Corporate Secretary, NIKE, Inc., One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. The recommendation should include the candidate’s name, age, qualifications (including principal occupation and employment history), and written consent to be named as a nominee in the Company’s proxy statement and to serve as a director, if elected. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 3 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Board of Directors The Board of Directors has adopted qualification standards for the selection of non-management nominees for director, which can be found at our corporate website: http://investors.nike.com . As provided in these standards and the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, nominees for director are selected on the basis of, among other things, distinguished business experience or other non-business achievements; education; significant knowledge of international business, finance, marketing, technology, law, or other fields which are complementary to, and balance the knowledge of, other Board members; a desire to represent the interests of all shareholders; independence; character; ethics; good judgment; diversity; and ability to devote substantial time to discharge Board responsibilities. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies qualified potential candidates without regard to their age, gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, or religion. While the Board has no policy regarding Board member diversity, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers and discusses diversity in selecting director nominees and in the re-nomination of an incumbent director. The Committee views diversity broadly, including gender, ethnicity, differences of viewpoint, geographic location, skills, education, and professional and industry experience, among others and believes that the Board is diverse across all spectrums. The Board believes that a variety and balance of perspectives on the Board results in more thoughtful deliberations. In considering the re-nomination of an incumbent director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the director’s overall service to the Company during his or her term, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation and quality of performance, as well as any special skills, experience or diversity that such director brings to the Board. All potential new director candidates, whether recommended by shareholders or identified by other means, are initially screened by the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, who may seek additional information about the background and qualifications of the candidate, and who may determine that a candidate does not have qualifications that merit further consideration by the full Committee. With respect to new director candidates who pass the initial screening, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets to discuss and consider each candidate’s qualifications and potential contributions to the Board, and determines by majority vote whether to recommend such candidates to the Board. The final decision to either appoint a candidate to fill a vacancy between annual meetings or include a candidate on the slate of nominees proposed at an annual meeting is made by the Board. It is the general policy of the Board that directors first elected after the fiscal year ended May 31, 1993 will not stand for re-election after reaching the age of 72.  Dr. Wise, who has served on the Board since 2009, has announced her retirement and will not stand for re-election to the Board at the 2017 Annual Meeting. Shareholder Communications with Directors Shareholders or interested parties desiring to communicate directly with the Board of Directors, with the non-management directors or with any individual director may do so in writing addressed to the intended recipient or recipients, c/o Ann M. Miller, Vice President and Corporate Secretary, NIKE, Inc., One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. All such communications will be reviewed, compiled as necessary, and then forwarded to the designated recipient or recipients in a timely manner. Board Leadership Structure NIKE’s governing documents provide the Board of Directors with flexibility to select the appropriate leadership structure of the Company. In determining the leadership structure, the Board considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business, fulfilling the duties of the Board, and the best interests of the Company’s shareholders. In 2004, the Board chose to separate the position of Chairman of the Board from the position of President and CEO; this was not a permanent policy of the Board. On June 30, 2016, the Company announced that the Chairman, Philip Knight, retired from the Board and that the Board appointed Mark Parker, the Company’s President and CEO since 2006, to the additional position of Chairman of the Board. As Chairman, Mr. Parker presides over meetings of the Board and shareholders. As President and CEO, Mr. Parker is in charge of the general supervision, direction, and control of the business and affairs of the Company, subject to the overall direction and supervision of the Board and its committees. Given Mr. Philip Knight’s retirement and, as the Company’s President and CEO since 2006, Mr. Parker’s unique knowledge of the Company’s business, particular experience, talent and tenure, the Board believes this leadership structure is appropriate for the Company. The structure permits Mr. Parker, by serving as both Chairman and CEO, to draw on his knowledge of the operations of the business, industry developments, customers, shareholders and employees in providing leadership on the broad strategic issues considered by the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determined that given the appointment of Mr. Parker as Chairman in addition to his positions of President and CEO, a lead independent director would ensure strong independent leadership of the Board. On June 30, 2016, the Company announced that the Board appointed Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, Inc., as Lead Independent Director of the Board to serve for a term of three years.  As Lead Independent Director, Mr. Cook executes the following functions: • serves as a liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors; • approves the meeting agendas for the Board; • advises the Chairman/CEO regarding the sufficiency, quality, quantity and timeliness of information provided to the Board; • ensures that meeting schedules permit sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; • provides consultation and direct communication with major shareholders, if requested; • presides at meetings of the Board at which the Chairman/CEO is not present, including executive sessions; and • performs other duties specified in the Lead Independent Director Charter. The chairs of Board committees also play an active role in the leadership structure of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board endeavor to select independent committee chairs who will provide strong leadership to guide the important work of the Board committees. Committee chairs work with the Company’s senior executives to ensure the committees are discussing the key strategic risks and opportunities of the Company. In the absence of the lead independent director, a presiding director is appointed to chair executive sessions of NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 4 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Board of Directors non-management directors (consisting of all directors other than Mr. Parker). The position of presiding director is rotated among the chairs of the various Board committees, other than the Executive Committee. Executive sessions are regularly scheduled and held at least once each year. On June 30, 2016, the Board appointed Mr. Philip Knight to the position of Chairman Emeritus, with a standing invitation to attend meetings of the Board and its committees as a non-voting observer.  The Board believed and continues to believe that it will benefit from the valuable experience and insights of the former Chairman of the Board. For all of these reasons, the Board believes this leadership structure is optimal. The Board’s Role in Risk Oversight While the Company’s management is responsible for day-to-day management of the various risks facing the Company, the Board of Directors takes an active role in the oversight of the management of critical business risks. The Board does not view risk in isolation. Risks are considered in virtually every business decision and as part of NIKE’s business strategy. The Board recognizes it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential for the Company to be competitive on a global basis and to achieve its strategic objectives. The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through committees, which play a significant role in carrying out risk oversight. While the Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of management’s risk management policies, oversight responsibility for particular areas of risk is allocated among the Board committees according to the committee’s area of responsibility as reflected in the committee charters. In particular: • The Audit Committee oversees risks related to the Company’s financial statements, the financial reporting process, accounting, legal matters, information security, and data protection. The Audit Committee oversees the internal audit function, reviews a risk-based plan of internal audits, and reviews a risk-based integrated audit of internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets separately with the Vice President of Corporate Audit and Chief Risk Officer, representatives of the independent registered public accountants, and senior management. • The Compensation Committee oversees risks and rewards associated with the Company’s compensation philosophy and programs, management succession plans, and executive development. • The Finance Committee oversees financial matters and risks relating to budgeting, investments, access to capital, capital deployment, acquisitions and divestitures, currency risk and hedging programs, and significant capital projects. • The Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee oversees issues that involve reputational risk to the Company, including community engagement, and sustainability innovation relating to the Company’s products, its supply chain, including labor practices, and the environment. • The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees risks associated with company governance, including NIKE’s code of business conduct and its ethics, compliance programs, and the structure and performance of the Board and its committees. Each committee chair works with the senior executive assigned to assist the committee to develop agendas for the year and for each meeting, paying particular attention to areas of business risk identified by management, Board members, internal and external auditors, and in their committee charter, and to schedule agenda topics, presentations, and discussions periodically regarding business risks within their area of responsibility. At meetings, the committees discuss areas of business risk, the potential impact, and management’s initiatives to manage business risk, often within the context of important business decisions. Through this process key business risk areas are reviewed at appropriate times, with some topics reviewed on several occasions throughout the year. At every Board meeting each committee chair provides a report to the full Board outlining its discussions and actions, including those affecting the oversight of various risks. The Company believes its leadership structure, discussed in detail above, supports the risk oversight function of the Board. Strong directors chair the various committees involved in risk oversight, there is open communication between management and directors, and all directors are involved in the risk oversight function. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics The NIKE Code of Ethics (“Ethics Code”) is available at the Company’s corporate website: http://investors.nike.com and will be provided in print without charge to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. The Ethics Code applies to all of the Company’s employees and directors, including our chief executive officer and all other executive officers. The Ethics Code provides that any waiver of the Ethics Code may be made only by the Board. Any such waiver in favor of a director or executive officer will be publicly disclosed. The Company plans to disclose amendments to, and waivers from, the Ethics Code on the Company’s corporate website: http://investors.nike.com. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 5 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROPOSAL 1 Proposal 1 Election of Directors A Board of 11 directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting. All of the nominees were elected at the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. Directors will hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are elected and qualified. Mr. Alan B. Graf, Jr.,  Dr. John C. Lechleiter, and Ms. Michelle A. Peluso are nominated by the Board of Directors for election by the holders of Class B Stock. The other eight nominees are nominated by the Board for election by the holders of Class A Stock. Under Oregon law, if a quorum of each class of shareholders is present at the Annual Meeting, the eight director nominees who receive the greatest number of votes cast by holders of Class A Stock and the three director nominees who receive the greatest number of votes cast by holders of Class B Stock will be elected directors. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of the vote. Unless otherwise instructed, proxy holders will vote the proxies they receive for the nominees listed below. If any nominee becomes unable to serve, the holders of the proxies may, in their discretion, vote the shares for a substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board. The Bylaws and the Corporate Governance Guidelines of the Company provide that any nominee for director in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of votes “withheld” from his or her election than votes “for” such election shall tender his or her resignation for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Committee will recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to the resignation. The Board will publicly disclose its decision within 90 days of the certification of the election results. Background information on the nominees as of July 21, 2017, including some of the attributes that led to their selection, appears below. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has determined that each director meets the qualification standards described in the section entitled “Director Nominations” above. In addition, the Board firmly believes that the experience, attributes, and skills of any single director should not be viewed in isolation, but rather in the context of the experience, attributes, and skills that all director nominees bring to the Board as a whole, each of which contributes to the function of an effective Board. Nominees for Election by Class A Shareholders Elizabeth J. Comstock Ms. Comstock, 56, a director since 2011, is Vice Chair of General Electric Company (“GE”).

We Do We Don’t Do ü Base a majority of total compensation on performance and retention incentives ü Set annual and long-term incentive targets based on clearly disclosed, objective performance measures ü Mitigate undue risk associated with compensation by using multiple performance targets, caps on potential incentive payments and a clawback policy ü Require executive officers and non-employee directors to hold NIKE stock through published stock ownership guidelines ü Vest equity awards over time to promote retention with a minimum of one year vesting ü Provide double-trigger change-in-control equity acceleration ü Require executive officers and directors to obtain pre-approval to pledge NIKE stock ü Conduct annual “say-on-pay” advisory votes û Retirement acceleration for restricted stock or restricted stock units (RSUs) û Payments of accumulated dividends on unearned RSUs until and unless shares are earned û Repricing of options without shareholder approval û Hedging transactions or short sales by executive officers or directors û Significant perquisites û Tax gross-ups for perquisites û Pension or supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) û Employment contracts û Cash-based change-in-control benefits û Excise tax gross-ups upon change of control Consideration of Say-on-Pay Vote Results The non-binding advisory proposal regarding compensation of the Named Executive Officers submitted to shareholders at our 2016 annual meeting was approved by 86% of the votes cast. The Committee believes this favorable outcome conveyed our shareholders’ support of our executive compensation program and the Committee’s decisions. After considering the shareholder vote and other factors in its annual review of our total executive compensation programs, the Committee made no material changes in the structure of our compensation programs. The Committee will continue to consider the outcome of the Company’s say-on-pay votes when conducting its regular practice of evaluating the executive compensation program and making future compensation decisions for the Named Executive Officers. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 15 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Financial Highlights under Incentive Plans NIKE delivered solid performance in fiscal 2017. The charts below set forth certain key financial results that were used in determining payouts under our incentive compensation plans for fiscal 2017. The measures below are based on NIKE’s comparable publicly reported financial results. 1 2015 and 2016 restated to reflect the December 23, 2015 two-for-one stock split. Executive Compensation Highlights The total compensation for each of the Named Executive Officers is shown in the Summary Compensation Table on page 26. While we describe executive compensation in greater detail throughout this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, actions the Committee took in fiscal 2017 are highlighted below: • Base Salary. Based on the recommendation by the Committee, which was approved by the independent members of the Board, Messrs. Parker and Spillane’s base salaries remained the same at $1,550,000 and $901,000, respectively.  Base salaries for Messrs. Campion, Edwards, and Sprunk increased to $900,000, $1,050,000, and $1,050,000, respectively. • Performance-Based Annual Incentive Plan. Target awards for Messrs. Parker, Campion, Edwards, and Sprunk remained the same, and Mr. Spillane’s target award was set at 100% of base salary.

Operation of the Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) evaluates the performance of the CEO against goals and objectives reviewed and approved by the Committee. Based on the evaluation, the Committee Chair discusses the CEO’s performance and recommended compensation with the independent members of the Board. The CEO’s base salary and the base salaries of the other Named Executive Officers are approved by the independent members of the Board based on the Committee’s recommendation. The Committee has sole responsibility for all other elements of Named Executive Officer compensation. The Committee also reviews the performance evaluation of those officers and the administration of our executive compensation programs. The Committee receives recommendations from the CEO as to compensation of other Named Executive Officers, and the CEO participates in Committee discussions regarding the compensation of those officers. The Committee meets in executive session without the CEO to determine his compensation. The Committee is comprised of Timothy D. Cook (Chairman), Elizabeth J. Comstock, John C. Lechleiter, and Johnathan A. Rodgers, each of whom is an independent director under applicable NYSE listing standards. The Committee operates pursuant to a written charter that is available on our website at: http://investors.nike.com . Each year, the Committee reviews our executive total compensation program to ensure it continues to reflect the Committee’s commitment to align the objectives and rewards of our executive officers with the creation of value for our shareholders. Similar to our non-executive compensation programs, the program has been designed to reinforce our pay-for-performance philosophy by delivering total compensation that motivates and rewards short- and long-term financial performance to maximize shareholder value, and to be externally competitive to attract and retain outstanding NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 16 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS and diverse executive talent. This is done much in the same way our human resources staff designs our non-executive compensation programs, to ensure they are market competitive, offer performance-based financial incentives, and provide opportunities to share in total Company success through competitive benefits, stock purchase discount programs, and broad-based profit sharing. In conducting its annual review, the Committee considers information provided by our human resources staff. Our human resources staff retains independent compensation consulting firms to provide surveys and reports containing competitive market data. These consultants do not formulate executive compensation strategies for NIKE or recommend individual executive compensation. The human resources staff uses the surveys and reports to make recommendations to the Committee concerning executive compensation. The Committee relies on its collective experience and judgment along with the recommendations prepared by our human resources staff to set executive compensation. The Committee has the authority, in its sole discretion, to retain compensation consultants to assist the Committee in evaluating the compensation of executive officers, but chose to not retain any such consultants in fiscal 2017. Use of Market Survey Data To help establish competitive ranges of base salary, incentive compensation opportunities, and target total compensation for the purpose of making recommendations to the Committee, our human resources staff uses competitive market data from surveys and reports prepared by Aon Hewitt and Willis Towers Watson. Historically, we consider market survey data from a peer group of companies which have similar revenue size, have similar products or markets, or reflect the companies with which we compete for executive talent. For fiscal 2017, we expanded these criteria to include market capitalization and brand value.  In addition, we consider market data across many industries, focusing on companies with revenues of $10 billion or more. In November 2015, we conducted our regular periodic review of our peer group. Based on the criteria described above, we determined that for the purposes of setting executive compensation for fiscal 2017, the peer group should be refined to include Procter & Gamble Company, Target Corporation and TJX Companies, Inc. and to remove Kohl’s Corporation and L Brands, Inc. The fiscal 2017 peer group was: Alphabet Inc. Kellogg Company Procter & Gamble Company The Coca-Cola Company Kimberly-Clark Corporation Starbucks Corporation Colgate-Palmolive Company Macy’s, Inc. Target Corporation eBay Inc. McDonald’s Corporation Time Warner Inc. FedEx Corporation Mondelez International, Inc. TJX Companies The Gap, Inc. Pepsico, Inc. The Walt Disney Company The surveys that our human resources staff reviews show percentile compensation levels for various executive positions with comparable job responsibilities. The staff also analyzes market data regarding compensation mix among base salary, annual incentive and long-term incentives such as performance-based cash awards, stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards. The Committee reviews this mix analysis when evaluating the separate compensation elements for each executive. The Committee does not endeavor to set executive compensation at or near any particular percentile, and it considers target total compensation to be competitive if it is generally within a reasonable range of the market median. Market data is one of many factors that the Committee considers in the determination of executive compensation levels. Other factors include internal pay equity, level of responsibility, the individual’s performance, expectations regarding the individual’s future potential contributions, succession planning and retention strategies, budget considerations, and the Company’s performance. Objectives and Elements of Our Compensation Program As noted in the Executive Summary, our executive compensation program is aligned with our business strategy and culture to attract and retain top talent, reward business results and individual performance, and most importantly, maximize shareholder value. Our total compensation program for the Named Executive Officers is highly incentive-based and competitive in the marketplace, with Company performance determining a significant portion of total compensation. Our program consists of the following elements: • Base salary that reflects the executive’s accountabilities, skills, experience, performance, and future potential • Performance-based annual cash incentive based on Company financial results under our Executive Performance Sharing Plan • A portfolio approach to long-term incentive compensation to provide a balanced mix of performance-based cash incentives and equity, including: ◦ Performance-based long-term cash incentive based on Company financial results to encourage attainment of long-term Company financial objectives ◦ Stock options to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders ◦ Restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit retention awards to provide incentives consistent with driving shareholder value, and to provide strong retention incentives • Benefits ◦ Executives are generally eligible for the same competitive benefits as other employees in the United States, including medical, dental, and vision insurance, paid time off, 401(k) plan, and Company-provided life and disability insurance; employees outside of the United States are offered locally competitive benefits. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 17 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ◦ Profit sharing contributions to defined contribution retirement plans ◦ Employee Stock Purchase Plan ◦ Post-termination payments under non-competition agreements In determining the award levels for each of the elements in our total compensation program, our philosophy is to “pay for performance.” As a result, we place relatively greater emphasis on the incentive components of compensation (performance-based annual cash incentive award, performance-based long-term cash incentive award, and stock options) to align the interests of our executives with shareholders, and motivate them to maximize shareholder value. This is balanced with retention incentives provided by base salary, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock unit awards. We look to the experience and judgment of the Committee to determine what it believes to be the appropriate target compensation mix for each Named Executive Officer. We do not apply fixed ratios or formulas, or rely solely on market data or quantitative measures. In allocating compensation among the various elements, the Committee considers market data, Company performance and budget, the impact of the executive’s position in the Company, individual past performance, expectations for future performance, experience in the position, any recent or anticipated changes in the individual’s responsibilities, internal pay equity for comparable positions, and retention incentives for succession planning. As shown in the charts below, incentive components accounted for 90% of the CEO’s target compensation and approximately 81% of the other Named Executive Officers’ target compensation in fiscal 2017. Elements of Our Compensation Program Base Salary When making recommendations to the Committee concerning base salary levels for our Named Executive Officers, our human resources staff follows a similar process to how they evaluate non-executive base salary levels. We consider the individual’s performance in the prior year, expectations regarding the individual’s future performance, experience in the position, any recent or anticipated changes in the individual’s responsibilities, internal pay equity for comparable positions, succession planning strategies, our annual salary budget, other elements of the individual’s compensation, and the market data described in “Use of Market Survey Data.” The Committee reviews these factors each year and adjusts base salary levels to ensure that we are appropriately rewarding performance. The Committee generally reviews base salaries of the Named Executive Officers annually based on a review of individual performance at a meeting in June, with salary adjustments becoming effective for the first pay period ending in August. During the salary review in June 2016, the Committee recommended, based on the factors described above, and the independent members of the Board approved, the following base salaries for the Named Executive Officers. Named Executive Officer Fiscal 2017 Base Salary % Change Mark G. Parker $1,550,000 0.0% Andrew Campion $900,000 8.4% Trevor A. Edwards $1,050,000 5.0% Eric D. Sprunk $1,050,000 5.0% Michael Spillane $901,000 N/A In setting a Named Executive Officer’s overall compensation package, the Committee places a relatively greater emphasis on the incentive components of compensation described below. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 18 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Performance-Based Annual Cash Incentive Annual awards are paid to the Named Executive Officers under our Executive Performance Sharing Plan (“PSP”). Our “pay for performance” philosophy for such awards is simple and applies to all global employees who are eligible to share in the Company’s success through incentive bonuses:  if we exceed our financial objectives, we will pay more; if we fail to reach them, we will pay less or nothing at all. The PSP for all executives is based 100% on overall corporate performance each year against a target based on the Company’s annual financial objective, as measured by income before income taxes (“PTI”), excluding the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or accounting changes. The Committee selected PTI as the performance measure as it aligns with the Company’s operational financial targets for the individual fiscal year. By focusing on driving strong operational performance each year, the plan supports our goal of delivering sustainable, profitable growth. The Committee retains the discretion to reduce or eliminate PSP award payouts based on individual or Company performance. Basing our annual cash incentive award program for all executives on overall corporate performance is intended to foster teamwork and send the message to each executive that his or her role is to help ensure overall organizational success and maximize shareholder value. Each year the Committee establishes a PSP target award for each Named Executive Officer based on its judgment of the impact of the position in the Company and what it believes to be competitive against market data as described in “Use of Market Survey Data,” while considering internal pay equity for comparable positions. For fiscal 2017, the Committee maintained Messrs. Parker, Campion, Edwards, and Sprunk’s target awards. Mr. Spillane’s target award was set at 100%. The fiscal 2017 PSP target awards were: Named Executive Officer Fiscal 2017 PSP Target Award (% of base salary) Mark G. Parker 180% Andrew Campion 100% Trevor A. Edwards 110% Eric D.Sprunk 100% Michael Spillane 100% In June 2016, the Committee established performance goals for the fiscal 2017 PSP awards based on its evaluation of our business plan and prospects for the year. The table below summarizes the fiscal 2017 PSP performance goals established by the Committee. For fiscal 2017, NIKE achieved a PTI of $4,886 million, a 5.7% increase over fiscal 2016 continuing operations PTI of $4,623 million. This achievement was below the target performance goal established by the Committee. As a result, each executive officer’s award was paid out at 58.86% of the target award. (Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 PSP Performance Goal Threshold Performance Threshold %  Payout Target Performance Target % Payout Maximum Performance Maximum %  Payout Actual Performance Actual % Payout PTI $4,813 1 50% $5,231 2 100% $5,649 3 150% $4,886 58.86% 4 1 Threshold performance represents 4.1% increase above fiscal 2016 continuing operations PTI. 2 Target performance represents 13.2% increase above fiscal 2016 continuing operations PTI. 3 Maximum performance represents 22.2% increase above fiscal 2016 continuing operations PTI. 4 Prorated for performance between payout levels. Performance-Based Long-Term Cash Incentive The first component in our long-term portfolio mix is performance-based awards payable in cash under our Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). As with the performance-based annual cash incentive, the LTIP follows our “pay for performance” philosophy. If we exceed our targets, we will pay more; if we fall short, we will pay less or nothing at all. This program focuses executives on overall, long-term financial performance, and is intended to reward them for delivering revenue growth and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) growth over a three-year performance period. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Committee establishes performance goals and potential cash payouts for the next three fiscal years for all executives under the LTIP. LTIP performance measures for all executives are based 50% on cumulative revenues for the three-year performance period and 50% on cumulative EPS for the period, in each case excluding generally the effect of acquisitions, divestitures and accounting changes. The Committee selected revenue and EPS as LTIP performance measures to encourage executives to focus on delivering profitable, sustainable growth. Strong revenue growth is the foundation of the Company’s financial strategy, requiring investments in key business drivers to sustain growth. EPS growth is essential to delivering value for our shareholders, requiring investments be targeted to those areas with the highest potential for return. By balancing revenue growth and EPS growth, the plan supports the Company’s objective of delivering long-term shareholder value. The Committee retains the discretion to reduce or eliminate LTIP award payouts based on individual or Company performance. During the compensation review in June 2016, the Committee approved LTIP target awards for all Named Executive Officers for the fiscal 2017-2019 performance period. The Committee set these targets based on its judgment of what it believes to be a desirable mix of long-term compensation, the impact of the position in the Company, and what it finds to be competitive against market data as described in “Use of Market Survey Data,” while maintaining internal pay equity for comparable positions. For the fiscal 2017-2019 performance period, the Committee maintained the targets for Messrs. Parker, Campion, Edwards, and Sprunk. Mr. Spillane’s target was set at $750,000. The target awards for the fiscal 2017-2019 performance period are as follows: NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 19 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Named Executive Officer Fiscal 2017-2019 LTIP Award Target ($) Mark G. Parker 3,500,000 Andrew Campion 750,000 Trevor A. Edwards 1,000,000 Eric D. Sprunk 750,000 Michael Spillane 750,000 In June 2016, the Committee established performance goals for the fiscal 2017-2019 LTIP. The Committee considered our long-term financial goals of high single-digit revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in setting performance goals for the target award payout level. The total payout percentage will be the average of the payout percentages determined for cumulative revenues and cumulative EPS, respectively. Payout below the threshold payout level may occur if either the revenue or EPS related percentage achievement is less than 50%. If both revenue and EPS fall below the threshold level, there is no payout. The table below summarizes the fiscal 2017-2019 LTIP performance goals. (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Fiscal 2017-2019 Performance Goals Threshold Performance 1 Threshold % Payout Target Performance 2 Target %      Payout Maximum Performance 3 Maximum % Payout Revenue $111,372 50% $115,684 100% $124,641 200% EPS $7.72 50% $8.32 100% $9.60 200% __________________________________________________________ 1 Threshold payout for revenue requires cumulative revenues corresponding to a 7% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from fiscal 2016 continuing operations revenue of $32,376 million. Threshold payout for EPS requires cumulative EPS corresponding to a 9% CAGR from fiscal 2016 continuing operations EPS of $2.16. 2 Target revenue payout requires a 9% CAGR and target EPS payout requires a 13% CAGR. 3 Maximum revenue payout requires a 13% CAGR and maximum EPS payout requires a 21% CAGR. For fiscal 2017, executive officers were eligible to receive LTIP award payouts based on performance targets set in June 2014 covering the fiscal 2015-17 performance period. In June 2017, the Committee determined a payout of 131.97% under these awards was earned based on the average of the payout percentages for cumulative revenues and cumulative EPS for the performance period shown in the table below: (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Fiscal 2015-2017 Performance Goals Threshold Performance Threshold %  Payout Target Performance Target % Payout Maximum Performance Maximum %    Payout Actual Performance Actual % Payout Revenue 1 $95,627 50% $99,329 100% $107,021 200% $97,327 72.96% EPS 2 $5.305 50% $5.715 100% $6.60 200% $6.52 190.97% Total Payout 131.97% 1 Cumulative revenues for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. 2 Cumulative EPS for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2015 and 2016 restated to reflect the December 23, 2015 two-for-one stock split. Stock Options The second component in our long-term portfolio mix is stock options. Stock options are designed to align the interests of the Company’s executives with those of shareholders by encouraging executives to enhance the value of the Company and, hence, the price of the Class B Stock. This is true “pay for performance,” executives are rewarded only if the market price of our stock rises, and they get nothing if the price does not rise or goes down. When determining the grants, the Committee generally focuses on the number of shares, while considering the value for accounting purposes. Our approach is based on our desire to carefully control annual share usage and avoid fluctuations in grant levels due to share price changes. The Committee awards stock options to each executive based on its judgment. The Committee considers a number of factors including the individual’s performance, management succession, competitive market data as described in “Use of Market Survey Data,” internal pay equity for comparable positions, and a desirable mix of long-term incentives. Our human resources staff periodically tests the reasonableness of our stock option grants against competitive market data and may make recommendations to the Committee. Options are generally granted annually to selected employees, including the Named Executive Officers, in July under our shareholder-approved Stock Incentive Plan. Stock options for fiscal 2017 were granted by the Committee on July 15, 2016 with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our stock on that date. In July 2016, the Committee granted options to Mr. Parker for 165,000 option shares, the same number of stock options granted to him in July 2015 before adjustment for the December 23, 2015 two-for-one stock split. Messrs. Campion, Edwards, and Sprunk received 75,000, 100,000, and 85,000 option shares, respectively, an increase of 15,000 shares for Mr. Campion, 10,000 shares for Mr. Edwards, and 5,000 shares for Mr. Sprunk from July 2015 before adjustment for the December 23, 2015 two-for-one stock split. Mr. Spillane received 50,000 option shares. The Committee, in its judgment, set these award levels based on the factors described above. Options granted by the Company generally vest in equal annual installments over a four-year period. To promote executive retention, unvested options generally are forfeited if the employee leaves before vesting occurs and must be exercised within three months after termination of employment. Options provide for a limited retirement provision designed to encourage employees to delay retirement, thus enhancing retention. Only those employees with a minimum of five years of service who are age 55 and above at the time of termination of employment are eligible for the provision. Under the provision, for employees between the ages of 55 to 59 at the time of termination of employment, only unvested stock NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 20 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS options that have been granted for at least one full year will continue to vest, and may be exercised for up to four years after termination. If an employee is age 60 or older and has at least five years of service at termination, unvested stock options that have been granted for at least one full year will receive accelerated vesting and may be exercised for up to four years after termination. The features related to accelerated vesting are described in “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control.” Based on their ages and years of service, as of May 31, 2017, Mr. Parker was eligible for accelerated vesting and Mr. Spillane was eligible for continued vesting of their options granted in July 2013, 2014, and 2015. Restricted Stock Awards The third component in our long-term portfolio mix is restricted stock awards. Stock ownership and stock-based incentive awards align the interests of our Named Executive Officers with the interests of our shareholders, as the value of this incentive rises and falls with the stock price. Restricted stock awards are generally granted annually to selected employees, including the Named Executive Officers, in July at the same meeting at which stock options are granted under our shareholder-approved Stock Incentive Plan. Awards generally vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. The awards promote executive retention, as unvested shares held at the time the executive’s employment is terminated are forfeited. Award recipients receive dividends on the full number of restricted shares awarded at the same time dividends are paid to other shareholders. The Committee, in its judgment, sets restricted stock award levels based on several factors, including what the Committee believes to be a desirable mix of long-term compensation, their determination of an appropriate weighting of potential future contribution to the Company, retention incentives, and competitive market data as described in “Use of Market Survey Data”. In July 2016, the Committee granted a restricted stock award to Mr. Parker valued at $3,500,000, representing 60,481 shares of our Class B Stock, based on the closing price on the grant date. This was the same value of restricted stock granted to Mr. Parker in July 2015. Messrs. Campion, Edwards and Sprunk received awards valued at $750,000, $875,000, and $750,000, respectively. This represented 12,961 shares of our Class B Stock for Mr. Campion, 15,121 shares of our Class B Stock for Mr. Edwards and 12,961 shares of our Class B Stock for Mr. Sprunk, based on the closing price on the grant date. This was an increase of $125,000 for Mr. Campion and the same value for Messrs. Edwards and Sprunk. Mr. Spillane received an award valued at $500,000, representing 8,641 of our Class B Stock based on the closing price on the grant date. Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Retention Awards From time to time, the Committee also grants restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that vest based on continued service with the Company through a future service date, for the specific purpose of further promoting retention. These RSU awards accumulate dividend equivalents that are only paid in cash upon full vesting. The awards have no value to the executive unless the executive remains employed with the Company for the full vesting period, and will be canceled if the executive terminates or retires within the vesting period. None of our Named Executive Officers received RSUs in fiscal 2017. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 21 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Profit Sharing and Retirement Plans Our 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan is a U.S. tax qualified retirement savings plan pursuant to which all eligible U.S. employees, including the Named Executive Officers, are able to make pre-tax contributions and after-tax contributions from their cash compensation. We make matching contributions for all participants each year equal to 100% of their pre-tax contributions up to 5% of their total eligible compensation. We also make annual profit sharing contributions to the accounts of eligible U.S. employees under the 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan. The contributions are allocated among eligible employees based on a percentage of their total salary and annual cash incentive award for the year. The total profit sharing contribution and the percentage of salary and annual cash incentive award contributed for each employee is determined each year by the Board of Directors. For fiscal 2017, the Board of Directors approved a profit sharing contribution for each eligible employee equal to 3.85% of the employee’s total eligible salary and annual cash incentive award. The Internal Revenue Code limits the amount of compensation that can be deferred under our 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, and also limits the amount of salary and annual cash incentive award ($265,000 for fiscal 2017) that may be taken into account when determining contributions under that plan. Accordingly, we provide our Named Executive Officers and other highly compensated employees with the opportunity to defer their compensation, including amounts in excess of the tax law limit, under our nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. We also make profit sharing contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan with respect to salary and annual cash incentive award of any eligible employee that exceeds the tax law limit, and for fiscal 2017 these contributions were equal to 3.85% of the total salary and annual cash incentive award of each Named Executive Officer in excess of $265,000. These contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan allow our Named Executive Officers and other highly compensated employees to receive profit sharing contributions in the same percentage as our other employees. We do not match deferrals to the Deferred Compensation Plan. Balances in the Deferred Compensation Plan, including the balances of the Named Executive Officers, are unsecured and at-risk, meaning the balances may be forfeited in the event of the Company’s financial distress such as bankruptcy. Our matching and profit sharing contributions for fiscal 2017 to the accounts of the Named Executive Officers under the qualified and nonqualified plans are included in the All Other Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table on page 26. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows all employees who work at least 20 hours per week in the United States and in many countries outside of the United States to purchase NIKE Class B Stock, through payroll deductions, at a 15% discount to the market price on the first or last trading day of the six-month purchase period, depending on which day the stock price was lower. No plan participant is allowed to purchase more than $25,000 in market value of our stock under the plan in any calendar year or more than 500 shares in any six-month offering period. In fiscal 2017, all Named Executive Officers participated in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, with the exception of Mr. Parker. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 22 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Post-termination Payments under Non-competition Agreements In exchange for non-competition agreements from all of our Named Executive Officers, we have agreed to provide, during the non-competition period, the monthly payments described in “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control,” some of which are at the election of the Company. We believe that it is appropriate to compensate individuals to refrain from working with competitors following termination, and that compensation enhances the enforceability of such agreements. Stock Ownership Guidelines On June 20, 2013, the Board of Directors adopted stock ownership guidelines for executive officers. These guidelines are designed to further align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders. Under the guidelines, the CEO and other executive officers are required to hold NIKE stock valued at the following multiple of their annual base salary: Position Ownership Level Chief Executive Officer 6X Base Salary Other Named Executive Officers 3X Base Salary Other Executive Officers 2X Base Salary Executive officers appointed prior to June 20, 2013 are required to attain these ownership levels by June 20, 2018 and new officers within five years of their appointment. Hedging and Pledging The Company’s Blackout and Pre-clearance Policy (which supplements our Insider Trading Policy) prohibits directors, executive officers and other designated insiders from engaging in transactions involving hedging, monetization or short sales of NIKE stock, including zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts. The policy also requires directors, executive officers and designated insiders to obtain pre-approval from the Company’s Corporate Secretary before pledging NIKE stock. Before granting approval of any pledge, the Corporate Secretary considers the size of the pledge relative to the individual’s other holdings, both direct and indirect, and NIKE’s shares outstanding; the risk of foreclosure given the nature of the associated transaction; protections against the appearance of insider trading, including prohibitions on sales during trading black-outs; and the ability to timely report sales on Form 4. Change-in-Control Provisions All unvested stock option, restricted stock, and restricted stock unit awards are subject to accelerated change-in-control vesting only when two events (a “double trigger”) occur. Vesting of grants is generally accelerated only if there is a change in control of the Company and either the acquiring entity fails to assume the awards or the employee’s employment is terminated by the acquirer without cause or by the employee for good reason within two years following a change in control. This double trigger was adopted to encourage executive retention through a period of uncertainty and a subsequent integration with an acquirer. The Committee believes that this approach will enhance shareholder value in the context of an acquisition, and align executives with the interests of investors. The effects of change-in-control transactions on stock option, restricted stock, and restricted stock unit awards are described further in “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.” Clawback Policy Since June 2010, the Company has had a policy for recoupment of incentive compensation (the “clawback policy”). In June 2015, the Committee and Board of Directors approved amendments to our incentive compensation plans to cover additional circumstances in which the Company may clawback awards.  Under the clawback policy, an executive officer who is involved in wrongful conduct that results in a restatement of the Company’s financial statements must repay to the Company up to the full amount of any incentive compensation based on the financial statements that were subsequently restated.  The clawback policy covers the annual cash incentive award, long-term cash incentive award, profit sharing contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan, and excess proceeds from sales of stock acquired under stock option, restricted stock, and restricted stock unit awards that occurred prior to the restatement.  The recent amendments to our Executive Performance Sharing Plan, Long-Term Incentive Plan and Stock Incentive Plan clarify that for all participants in those plans the Committee may apply additional clawback policies to awards, or add clawback terms to award agreements or notices, and that any clawback requirements of applicable law and regulation will apply to the plans. Risk Assessment At the Committee’s request, in fiscal 2017 management prepared and discussed with the Committee an assessment of potential risk associated with the Company’s compensation programs, including any risk that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. This included an assessment of risks associated with each element of employee compensation. The assessment considered certain design features of the compensation programs that reduce the likelihood of excessive risk taking, such as reasonable performance targets, capped payouts of incentive compensation, a balance of short- and long-term incentives, a balance of cash and equity incentives, vesting of awards over time, and the potential for clawback of incentive compensation. In addition, for equity compensation, the Committee and the Board have adopted stock ownership guidelines, limited accelerated vesting of stock options upon termination of employment, and implemented double-trigger accelerated vesting for all equity awards upon change in control (each as described above). NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 23 Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for annual compensation over $1 million paid to their chief executive officer and the next three most highly compensated executive officers (other than the principal financial officer). The Internal Revenue Code generally excludes from the calculation of the $1 million cap compensation that is based on the attainment of pre-established, objective performance goals established under a shareholder-approved plan. The Committee considers, among other things, the impact of this exclusion for performance-based compensation when developing and implementing our executive compensation programs. Annual cash incentive awards under our Executive Performance Sharing Plan, long-term cash incentive awards under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, and stock options under our Stock Incentive Plan generally are designed in a manner that is intended to meet the requirements under the exclusion. However, due to the complex nature of the requirements that must be met, we cannot guarantee that such awards will qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m). While the Committee seeks to preserve tax deductibility in developing and implementing our compensation program, the Committee also believes that it is important to maintain flexibility in administering compensation programs in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals. Accordingly, we have not adopted a policy that all compensation must qualify as deductible for tax purposes. Therefore, amounts paid under any of our executive compensation programs may not qualify as performance-based compensation that is excluded from the Section 162(m) limitation on deductibility.

Under this plan, the Compensation Committee approved target awards for fiscal 2017 based on a percentage of the executive’s base salary paid during fiscal 2017 as follows: Mr. Parker, 180%; Mr. Campion, 100%; Mr. Edwards, 110%; Mr. Sprunk, 100%; and Mr. Spillane, 100%. The Committee also established a series of performance targets based on our income before income taxes (“PTI”) for fiscal 2017 (excluding the effect of acquisitions, divestitures and accounting changes not reflected in our business plan at the time of approval of the target awards) corresponding to award payouts ranging from 50% to 150% of the target awards. The PTI for fiscal 2017 required to earn the target award payout was $5,231 million. The PTI for fiscal 2017 required to earn the 150% maximum payout was $5,649 million. The PTI for fiscal 2017 required to earn the 50% threshold payout was $4,813 million. Participants receive a payout at the percentage level at which the performance target is met, subject to the Committee’s discretion to reduce or eliminate any award based on Company or individual performance. Actual award payouts earned in fiscal 2017 and paid in fiscal 2018 are shown in footnote 4 to the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table. (2) These amounts represent the potential performance-based long-term cash incentive awards payable for performance during the three-year period consisting of fiscal 2017-2019 under our Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under this plan, the Compensation Committee approved target awards for the performance period and also established a series of performance targets based on our cumulative revenues and cumulative diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) for the performance period (excluding the effect of acquisitions, divestitures and accounting changes not reflected in our business plan at the time of approval of the target awards) corresponding to award payouts ranging from 50% to 200% of the target awards. Participants will receive a payout at the average of the percentage levels at which the two performance targets are met, subject to the Committee’s discretion to reduce or eliminate any award based on Company or individual performance. For cumulative revenues over the performance period, the target payout requires revenues of $115,684 million, the 50% threshold payout requires revenues of $111,372 million, and the 200% maximum payout requires revenues of $124,641 million. For cumulative EPS over the performance period, the target payout requires EPS of $8.32, the 50% threshold payout requires EPS of $7.72, and the 200% maximum payout requires EPS of $9.60. Under the terms of the awards, on the first payroll period ending in August 2019 we will issue the award payout to each participant, provided that the participant is employed by us on the last day of the performance period.

The amounts reported in the NIKE Contributions column represent profit sharing contributions made by us in early fiscal 2017 based on fiscal 2016 results; these amounts are also included in amounts reported for fiscal 2016 in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. Of the amounts reported in the Aggregate Balance column, the following amounts have been reported in the Summary Compensation Tables in this proxy statement or in prior year proxy statements: Mr. Parker, $13,732,340; Mr. Campion, $443,705; Mr. Edwards, $9,586,681; Mr. Sprunk, $3,878,118; and Mr Spillane, $67,070. Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in our Deferred Compensation Plan (the “DCP”). Participants in the DCP may elect in advance to defer up to 100 percent of their annual base salary, bonus, and long-term incentive payments. Each year, we share profits with our employees in the form of profit sharing contributions to defined contribution retirement plans. The contributions are allocated among eligible employees based on a percentage of their total salary and bonus for the year. To the fullest extent permitted under Internal Revenue Code limitations, these contributions are made to employees’ accounts under our qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan. Contributions based on salary and bonus in excess of the tax law limit ($265,000 for fiscal 2017) are made as NIKE contributions under the DCP. Amounts deferred under the DCP are credited to a participant’s account under the DCP. Each participant may allocate his or her account among any combination of the investment funds available under the DCP. Participants’ accounts are adjusted to reflect the investment performance of the funds selected by the participants. Participants can change the allocation of their account balances daily. The funds available under the DCP consist of 16 mutual funds with a variety of investment objectives. The investment funds had annual returns in fiscal 2017 ranging from 0.41% to 27.07%. Amounts credited to participants’ accounts are invested by us in actual investments matching the investment options selected by the participants to ensure that we do not bear any investment risk related to participants’ investment choices. The portion of a participant’s account attributable to elective deferrals, including investment returns, is fully vested at all times. The portion of a participant’s account attributable to NIKE contributions, including investment returns, is fully vested after the participant has been employed by us for five years. All of the Named Executive Officers are fully vested in their NIKE contributions. Each time they elect to defer compensation, participants make an election regarding distribution of the compensation deferred under the election (as adjusted to reflect investment performance). A participant may elect for distribution to be made in a lump sum at the beginning of a predetermined year while the participant is still employed or in service (but no sooner than the fourth year after the year in which the distribution election is submitted). Alternatively, a participant may elect for distribution to be made in a lump sum or in quarterly installments over five, ten or fifteen years after termination of employment or service. Participants have limited rights to change their distribution elections. Participants may make a hardship withdrawal under certain circumstances. Subject to certain limitations, a participant may also at any time request to withdraw amounts from his or her account balance that were vested as of December 31, 2004 (and any subsequent investment returns on such amount). If such request is approved, the participant may withdraw 90% of the amount requested, and the remaining 10% will be permanently forfeited. Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control Change-in-Control Compensation — Acceleration of Equity Awards All unvested stock option, restricted stock, and restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are subject to accelerated vesting upon the occurrence of two events (a “double trigger”): there is a “change in control”; and the Named Executive Officer’s employment is terminated by us without “cause” or by NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 32 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION the Named Executive Officer for “good reason,” in each case on or before the second anniversary of the change in control.  Double-trigger accelerated vesting of all awards will also occur if the Named Executive Officer’s employment is terminated without “cause” or for “good reason” between shareholder approval of the change in control and the occurrence of the change in control (and, for restricted stock and RSUs, the change in control occurs within one year following the termination). In addition, for stock options granted since July 2010, the standard period for exercising options following termination of employment is extended from three months to four years, but not beyond each option’s original 10-year term.  Accelerated vesting of stock options and RSUs will also occur if we are acquired and the acquiring company does not assume the outstanding options or RSUs. In our agreements, “change in control” is generally defined to include: • the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of our outstanding Class A Stock or, if the Class A Stock no longer elects a majority of directors, the acquisition by any person of 30% or more of our total outstanding Common Stock, • the nomination (and subsequent election) in a two-year period of a majority of our directors by persons other than the incumbent directors, • a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and • an acquisition of NIKE through a merger, consolidation or share exchange. In our agreements, “cause” generally includes willful and continued failure to substantially perform assigned duties and willful engagement in illegal conduct materially injurious to us. In our agreements, “good reason” generally includes a material diminution in position or duties, a salary reduction or material reduction in other benefits, and a home office relocation of over 50 miles. The following table shows the estimated benefits that would have been received by the Named Executive Officers if double-trigger accelerated vesting had occurred on May 31, 2017, when the closing price of our Class B Stock was $52.99 per share.

The award agreements provide for full double-trigger accelerated vesting as described above (for Performance-Based RSUs granted to Mr. Parker, assuming such awards are earned at 100%).  The amounts in the table above represent the number of unvested restricted shares and RSUs multiplied by the closing price of our Class B Stock on May 31, 2017. (2) Information regarding outstanding unexercisable options held by each Named Executive Officer is set forth in the Outstanding Equity Awards table above. The agreements governing unvested stock options provide for full double-trigger accelerated vesting and an extended post-termination exercise period as described above. Amounts in the table above represent the sum of (i) for each Named Executive Officer’s outstanding unexercisable options, the aggregate value as of May 31, 2017 of those options assuming a four-year remaining term and otherwise calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions consistent with those used by us for valuing our options under accounting guidance applicable to stock-based compensation, plus (ii) for each Named Executive Officer’s outstanding exercisable options granted since July 2010, the increase in value of those options resulting from the extension of the post-termination exercise period from three months to four years, with the option values for three-month and four-year remaining terms calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions consistent with those used for valuing our options under accounting guidance applicable to stock-based compensation. Benefits Triggered on Certain Employment Terminations Stock Option Acceleration and Extension As of May 31, 2017, each Named Executive Officer held options to purchase Class B Stock as listed in the Outstanding Equity Awards table above. Under the terms of the stock options granted to each Named Executive Officer before July 2010, upon the death or disability of the officer, the standard three-month period for exercising options following termination of employment is extended to 12 months, but not beyond each option’s original 10-year term. Under the terms of the stock options granted to each Named Executive Officer since July 2010, upon the death or disability of the officer, all unexercisable options become fully exercisable and the standard three-month period for exercising options following termination of employment is extended to four years, but not beyond each option’s original 10-year term. If death or disability of a Named Executive Officer had occurred on May 31, 2017, the sum of (i) for outstanding unexercisable options that would have become exercisable, the aggregate value as of May 31, 2017 of those options assuming a four-year remaining term and otherwise calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions consistent with those used by us for valuing our options under accounting guidance applicable to stock-based compensation, plus (ii) for outstanding exercisable options, the increase in value, if any, of those options resulting from the extension of the post-termination exercise period from three months to 12 months, in the case of options granted before July 2010, and from three months to four years, in the case of options granted since July 2010, with the option values as of May 31, 2017 for three-month, twelve-month and four-year remaining terms calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions consistent with those used by us for valuing our options under accounting guidance applicable to stock-based compensation, is $8,928,511 for Mr. Parker, $4,587,581 for Mr. Edwards, $4,311,162 for Mr. Sprunk, $2,445,902 for Mr. Spillane, and $2,643,749 for Mr. Campion. Under the terms of the unvested stock options granted to Named Executive Officers since July 2010, vesting of options that have been outstanding for at least one year will be accelerated if the holder retires after reaching age 60 with at least 5 years of service, and vesting of options that have been outstanding for at least one year will continue notwithstanding termination of employment if the holder retires after reaching age 55 with at least 5 years of service. In addition, for any holder who retires after reaching age 55 (but before reaching age 60) with at least 5 years of service, the standard three-month period for exercising these options following termination of employment will be extended to four years, but not beyond the option’s original ten-year term. If termination of employment of a Named Executive Officer (other than due to death or disability) had occurred on May 31, 2017, the sum of (i) for outstanding unexercisable options that would have become exercisable, the aggregate value as of May 31, NIKE, INC.

The value for Messrs. Sprunk, Campion and Edwards is zero because they have not reached age 55. Stock Award Acceleration As of May 31, 2017, each Named Executive Officer held unvested restricted stock and/or restricted stock units as set forth in the Outstanding Equity Awards table above. Under the terms of their award agreements, all unvested restricted shares and restricted stock units will immediately vest fully upon the death or disability of the officer, except that Performance-Based RSUs held by Mr. Parker will vest at the threshold amount. The value of the unvested restricted shares and restricted stock units held by each Named Executive Officer as of May 31, 2017 that would have become vested if death or disability had occurred on that date is as set forth in the “Stock Award Acceleration” column of the Change-in-Control Compensation — Acceleration of Equity Awards table above, except that the amount for Mr. Parker would be $27,595,655. Payments Under Noncompetition Agreements We have an agreement with Mr. Parker that contains a covenant not to compete that extends for two years following the termination of his employment with us. The agreement provides that if Mr. Parker’s employment is terminated by us, we will make monthly payments to him during the two-year noncompetition period in an amount equal to one-twelfth of his then current annual salary and target Performance Sharing Plan bonus (“Annual NIKE Income”). The agreement provides further that if Mr. Parker voluntarily resigns, we will make monthly payments to him during the two-year noncompetition period in an amount equal to one-twenty-fourth of his then current Annual NIKE Income. However, commencement of the above-described monthly payments will be delayed until after the six-month period following Mr. Parker’s separation from service, and all payments that he would otherwise have received during that period will be paid in a lump sum promptly following the end of the period, together with interest at the prime rate. If employment is terminated without “cause”, the parties may mutually agree to waive the covenant not to compete, and if employment is terminated for “cause”, we may unilaterally waive the covenant. Under Mr. Parker’s noncompetition agreement, “cause” means continual and repeated neglect of duties or acts of dishonesty. If the covenant is waived, we will not be required to make the payments described above for the months as to which the waiver applies. If the employment of Mr. Parker had been terminated by us on May 31, 2017, and assuming the covenant is not waived, we would have been required to pay Mr. Parker $361,667 per month for the 24-month period ending May 31, 2019. If Mr. Parker had voluntarily resigned on May 31, 2017, and assuming the covenant is not waived, we would have been required to pay Mr. Parker $180,833 per month for the 24-month period ending May 31, 2019. We have noncompetition agreements with Messrs. Campion, Sprunk, Edwards and Spillane on the same terms, except that the noncompetition period is one year instead of two years, payments may commence on termination, and we may unilaterally waive the covenant in all cases including termination without cause (in which case payments would cease). In addition, for Messrs. Campion, Sprunk, Edwards and Spillane, the monthly payments are one-twelfth or one-twenty-fourth of their then current annual salaries, instead of their Annual NIKE Income. If the employment of these officers had been terminated by us on May 31, 2017 and assuming the covenant is not waived, we would have been required to pay Mr. Campion $75,000 per month, Messrs. Sprunk  and Edwards $87,500 per month, and Mr. Spillane $75,083 for the 12-month period ending May 31, 2018. If these officers had voluntarily resigned on May 31, 2017 and assuming the covenant is not waived, we would have been required to pay Mr. Campion $37,500 per month, Messrs. Sprunk and Edwards $43,750 per month, and Mr. Spillane $37,542 per month for the 12-month period ending May 31, 2018. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 34 PROPOSAL 2 Proposal 2 Shareholder Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are submitting to shareholders our annual “say-on-pay proposal,” an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as described in this proxy statement. At the Company’s 2011 annual meeting of shareholders, we provided shareholders with an advisory vote with respect to how often we should hold a say-on-pay proposal vote, and shareholders voted in favor of holding such a vote annually.  Consistent with the voting results, we have held an advisory vote  each year.  At our 2017 Annual Meeting, in addition to this say-on-pay proposal, we will hold an advisory vote on say-on-pay proposal frequency.  For information regarding the advisory vote on say-on-pay proposal frequency, see Proposal 3 below on page 36. At the Company’s 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, 86% of the votes cast on the say-on-pay proposal were voted in favor of the proposal. The Compensation Committee believes this affirms shareholders’ support of the Company’s approach to executive compensation. As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, our compensation philosophy is designed to attract and retain highly talented individuals, provide rewards for strong business results and individual performance, and motivate executives to maximize long-term shareholder value. The program is competitive in the marketplace, highly incentive-based to align interests of executives with those of shareholders, and balanced across incentives to appropriately mitigate risk. To achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program and emphasize pay-for-performance principles, the Compensation Committee has continued to employ the strong governance practices described in “Executive Compensation Governance Practices” on page 15, including: • basing a majority of total compensation on performance and retention incentives; • setting annual and long-term incentive targets based on clearly disclosed, objective performance measures and the Company’s performance goals; • mitigating undue risk associated with compensation by using multiple performance targets, caps on potential incentive payments and a clawback policy; and • requiring executive officers and non-employee directors to hold NIKE stock through published stock ownership guidelines. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board.  However, the Board values shareholder opinions, and the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. Board Recommendation The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote FOR approval of the following resolution: RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the fiscal 2017 compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the SEC’s compensation disclosure rules (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables). NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 35 PROPOSAL 3 Proposal 3 Frequency of Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation In addition to providing our shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on executive compensation, in accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are also submitting to an advisory shareholder vote how frequently advisory votes on executive compensation should occur.  Shareholders are voting on the following resolution: RESOLVED, that a non-binding advisory vote of the shareholders to approve the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers should be held (1) every year, (2) every two years, or (3) every three years, as determined by the alternative that receives the highest number of votes cast for it. After careful consideration and consistent with past practice, the Board of Directors recommends an annual vote.  The Board believes in the value of the opportunity for shareholders to voice their opinion annually on the Company’s executive compensation. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board. However, the Board values shareholder opinions, and will give significant weight to shareholder preferences on this matter. Board Recommendation The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote for future shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation to be held EVERY YEAR. Holders of Class A Stock and Class B Stock will vote together as a single class on Proposal 3. The option of every year, every two years, or every three years that receives the highest number of votes cast by shareholders will be the frequency approved by shareholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for the purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, but have no effect on the results of the vote. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 36 PROPOSAL 4 Proposal 4 Approval of the NIKE, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan, as Amended In 1997, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders approved, our Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan gives us broad authority to make long-term incentive awards payable in cash and to permit qualification of certain awards (“162(m) Awards”) as “performance-based compensation” as defined under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), thereby permitting full deductibility of amounts paid under the Plan to the Named Executive Officers. The Code requires that the material terms of the performance targets under the Plan be approved by shareholders every five years in order for 162(m) Awards under the Plan to continue to qualify as performance-based compensation. See “162(m) Approval” below on page 38. The shareholders last approved the Plan in 2012. Unless the shareholders again approve the Plan as requested in this proposal, the Plan will terminate at the 2017 Annual Shareholder Meeting. If the shareholders approve the Plan, the Plan will be extended for an additional five years until the first shareholder meeting in 2022. The Board of Directors has adopted amendments to the Plan, subject to shareholder approval, including, but not limited to, increasing the maximum amount payable to any participant under the Plan for performance periods ending in any year from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000 and expanding the number of performance targets. The Board of Directors believes that the increased limit recognizes changes in executive compensation practices and provides flexibility with respect to multi-year performance periods ending in the same year.  The Board of Directors believes that flexibility in performance targets is advisable given the evolution of the Company’s business and the metrics by which it judges its performance. The complete text of the Plan, marked to show the proposed amendments, is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A. The following description of the proposed amended Plan is a summary of certain provisions and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit A. Description of the Plan Eligible Participants. The Plan provides that all of our employees and the employees of our subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the Plan. Although this group currently consists of approximately 75,000 persons, our current intent is to grant awards under the Plan to approximately 420 current officers and senior managers. Administration. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) which is composed solely of “outside directors” as that term is defined in regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code. The Committee may promulgate rules and regulations for the operation of the Plan and related agreements and generally supervises the administration of the Plan. The Committee determines the individuals to whom awards are made under the Plan, the amount of the awards, and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Target Awards. The Committee may grant target awards payable in cash and shall make 162(m) Awards within 90 days after the commencement of the period covered by the award (the “Performance Period”), or before 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed if the Performance Period is less than one year. All or part of the awards will be earned if performance targets established by the Committee for the Performance Period are met and the participant satisfies any other restrictions or goals established by the Committee.  Performance targets must be expressed as an objectively determinable level of our performance or the performance of any of our subsidiaries, divisions or other units, based on one or more of the following: net income; net income before taxes; operating income; revenues; return on sales; return on equity; earnings per share; total shareholder return; return on capital; return on invested capital; return on assets; return on operating revenue earnings before any one or more of: interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization or stock-based compensation expense; stock price; cash flow; operating margin or profit margin; market share; or any of the foregoing with such objectively determinable adjustments, modifications or amendments as the Committee may determine appropriate at the time of establishing the performance target. The Committee shall not establish target award opportunities for any participant such that the maximum amount payable under target awards which have Performance Periods ending in any single fiscal year exceeds $15,000,000. Determination of Award Payouts. At the end of each Performance Period, the Committee will determine and certify for 162(m) Awards, the attainment of the performance targets and the calculation of the payouts of the related target awards.  No 162(m) Award shall be paid if the related performance targets are not met. The Committee may also, in its discretion, reduce or eliminate a participant’s calculated award based on circumstances relating to our performance or the performance of the participant. Clawback Policy. Awards under the Plan are subject to the Company’s Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation. This clawback policy generally requires executive officers who are involved in wrongful conduct that results in a restatement of the Company’s financial statements to repay to the Company the full amount of any payout received by the executive officer that was calculated in whole or in part based on the financial statements that were subsequently misstated. Awards under the Plan will also be subject to such other policy regarding clawback or recoupment of incentive compensation as may be subsequently approved by the Committee from time to time or set forth in any agreement or notice evidencing an award, as well as the requirements of applicable law and regulation regarding clawback or recoupment of incentive compensation. By accepting any awards under the Plan, a participant expressly agrees to repay to the Company any amount that may be required to be repaid under these provisions. Amendment and Termination. The Plan, and awards made or outstanding under the Plan (including awards currently outstanding under the Plan), may be amended by the Committee with the approval of the Board of Directors, at any time except that (i) no modification shall adversely affect the payment of a target award without the participant’s consent and (ii) no modification shall be made to the extent that shareholder approval would be required to maintain the qualification of 162(m) Awards as performance-based compensation. Unless again approved by the shareholders, the Plan will terminate at the 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 37 PROPOSAL 4 162(m) Approval Section 162(m) of the Code prevents a publicly held corporation from claiming federal income tax deductions for compensation in excess of $1 million per year paid to any of its chief executive officer or three other most highly compensated executive officers (other than the chief financial officer). However, if certain conditions are met, compensation that qualifies as “performance-based” is excluded for purposes of calculating the amount of compensation subject to the $1 million limit. In general, one of the requirements that must be satisfied to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code is that the material terms of the performance goals under which the compensation may be paid must be disclosed to and approved by our shareholders every five years. Thus, our shareholders are being asked to approve this Proposal 4 to ensure that the Committee has the flexibility to grant awards under the Plan, as amended, that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. If our shareholders do not approve the Plan as amended, no new awards will be granted to covered employees under the Plan, and the Committee will make a determination in its business judgment as to the appropriate compensation for such employees, taking into account considerations important to the Company’s success and the benefits and costs to the Company, including the additional costs arising from the Company’s inability to deduct all or a portion of the compensation paid to covered employees. Plan Benefits The actual amount of compensation to be paid to participants under the Plan is not determinable in advance because awards granted under the Plan will be subject to the Committee’s discretion, and the Committee has not determined future amounts or who might receive them.  In June 2016, the Committee made target awards under the Plan for the fiscal 2017-2019 Performance Period which are summarized in the following table, and which would not have changed had the Plan, as proposed here, been in place instead of the current Long-Term Incentive Plan. Since the Plan was adopted in 1997, similar target awards have been made for the three-year Performance Periods commencing each year. The payout for the fiscal 2015-2017 Performance Period (the most recently completed Performance Period) was 131.97% of target. The actual compensation received by the Named Executive Officers under the Plan for fiscal 2015-2017 is shown in footnote 3 to the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table. The actual compensation received by all current executive officers (including the Named Executive Officers) as a group under the Plan for fiscal 2015-2017 was $10.8 million. The actual compensation received by all other employees as a group under the Plan for fiscal 2015-2017 was $63.8 million.

Non-employee directors are not eligible to participate in the Plan; accordingly, they are omitted from the table. (2) The Committee established a series of performance targets based on revenues and earnings per share for the three-year period consisting of fiscal 2017-2019 corresponding to award payouts ranging from 50% to 200% of the target awards. Board Recommendation The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote FOR approval of the Plan as amended. Holders of Class A Stock and Class B Stock will vote together as a single class on Proposal 4. If a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, Proposal 4 will be approved if the number of shares voted in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of shares voting against the proposal.  Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, but are not counted as voting either for or against and therefore have no effect on the results of the vote. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 38 PROPOSAL 5 Proposal 5 Shareholder Proposal Regarding Political Contributions Disclosure The following shareholder proposal (the “Proposal”) will be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent.  Mercy A. Rome, c/o Investor Voice, SPC, 111 Queen Anne Ave N, Suite 500, Seattle, WA 98109, a holder of 76 shares of Class B Stock submitted the Proposal. The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the Proposal and asks shareholders to read through NIKE’s response which follows the shareholder proposal. THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED :  Shareholders request that Nike, Inc. provide a report, updated annually, to disclose Nike’s: 1. Policies for making direct or indirect contributions and payments with corporate funds to: • Participate or intervene in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office, or • Influence the general public, or any segment thereof, with respect to an election or referendum. 2. Monetary and non-monetary contributions and expenditures (direct and indirect) used in the manner described in section 1 above, including: • The identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each; and • The title(s) of person(s) at Nike responsible for decision-making or oversight. The report shall be presented to the Board or relevant Board committee, and posted on Nike’s public website. Supporting Statement Long-term shareowners support transparency and accountability in corporate spending on political activities, both because it  is in our best interest and because it is critical for Nike’s compliance with federal ethics laws.  Gaps in reporting disserve shareowners and expose Nike to reputational and business risks that can harm shareowner value. Nike’s current political spending policy has a number of significant gaps: 1. In 2011 Nike pledged annual disclosures, but the 2013 and 2014 reports (the first released) reported only on Oregon, and the 2015 report only included California.  A 2016 report has not yet been posted to the company’s website. Nike’s disclosure policy is contorted and difficult to understand. Its convoluted and legalistic language seems crafted to ensure: (A) that only one State per year will be reported on, and (B) that Nike will only report “direct” (not indirect) or “cash” (not in-kind) payments. Indirect payments are often the largest and most risky type of contribution or payment - they need to be accounted for and reported to shareowners. 2. The policy requires senior-executive approval of contributions only when amounts to a single entity are in excess of $100,000 - which creates significant gaps, too little oversight, and levels of risk that do not reflect appropriate Board stewardship or oversight. 3. The policy ignores payments to third-party groups - whether trade associations or 501(c)(4) entities - which are the major ‘dark money’ conduits by which corporate cash enters the political system. According to reliable public sources, Nike has contributed at least $2,460,000 ($2.46 million) in corporate funds since the 2004 election cycle. However, public data only provides a partial picture and Nike does not report on payments it makes to trade associations and 501(c)(4)s, which are the most questionable and risky forms of payments. In order for shareowners to be able to evaluate these risks, and for the Board to adequately fulfill its fiduciary duty to shareowners, the Company must make comprehensive disclosures that include payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations. Doing so would bring Nike in line with Northwest corporate peers that embrace comprehensive disclosure: • Boeing • Microsoft • Nordstrom • Starbucks The Company’s Statement in Opposition to Proposal 5 The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this shareholder proposal because: • Our current policies and public disclosures already address many of the items requested by the proposal; • In the Board’s judgment, more disclosure than we already provide would not be in the best interests of shareholders; and • In 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 virtually identical proposals were rejected by approximately 78%, 82%, 73%, and 71%, respectively, of shares voted. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 39 PROPOSAL 5 Frankly, we agree with our shareholders. NIKE has strong governance practices and accountability in corporate spending on political activities, and we have a level of transparency that we believe allows shareholders to have the information they need to make informed decisions. The Proposal is unnecessary to achieve these objectives, and the proponent offers no new compelling evidence or arguments in support of the proposal. NIKE’s Political Contributions Policy (the “Policy”) is designed to give shareholders confidence that there is proper oversight of political activity, and to allow shareholders to assess any risks associated with significant contributions. All of our political contributions and expenditures are made in accordance with the Policy and our objective is to strictly comply with all public reporting laws. Our Policy ensures that political contributions, trade group memberships, and policy statements are made in a manner consistent with NIKE’s core values to protect or enhance shareholder value, without regard to the private political preferences of our corporate officers. Our Policy describes the policies and procedures for making corporate political contributions, how they are approved, who must approve them, and how they are reported to the Board’s independent Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. We disclose our Policy on our website at http://investors.nike.com/investors/corporate-governance. Consistent with our Policy, we also annually disclose on our website all direct political contributions to any candidate, political party, or ballot initiative in any year that exceeds $100,000, and all political contributions in any U.S. state where we make more than 50% of our political contributions in any year. We believe these disclosures provide shareholders meaningful information to assess any risks posed by significant political contributions. Our disclosures are simple, accurate, and clear.  And we have posted them for every year starting with 2012. Our Policy also requires that management annually report to the Board’s independent Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on compliance with our Policy, and to review the strategic priorities for political contributions and trade association affiliations, to ensure they align with the long-term business objectives of the Company. The additional disclosure requested in this proposal could place NIKE at a competitive disadvantage by revealing strategies and priorities designed to protect the economic future of NIKE, its employees, and shareholders. Because parties with interests adverse to NIKE also participate in the political process to their business advantage, any unilateral expanded disclosure could benefit them, while harming the interests of NIKE and its shareholders. In summary, the Board of Directors believes the proposal is unnecessary because NIKE has for years followed a comprehensive policy for oversight and disclosure of political contributions. The proposal would create unnecessary administrative costs, as well as expose NIKE to competitive harm, without commensurate benefit to our shareholders. Our shareholders have understandably rejected this proposal four times before. Board Recommendation The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 40 PROPOSAL 6 Proposal 6 Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has sole authority to retain, with shareholder ratification, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee directly oversees the firm’s work with respect to the annual audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and approves all audit engagement fees and terms. At least annually, the Audit Committee evaluates the independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications, performance, and independence, including a review and evaluation of its lead partner. The Audit Committee is also involved in the selection of the new lead engagement partner following mandated rotation of the firm’s lead partner, and is responsible for considering the benefits of rotation of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to audit the Company’s consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2018 and to render other professional services as required. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has served as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for many years. The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the continued retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Audit Committee is submitting the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to shareholders for ratification. If the appointment is not ratified by our shareholders, the Audit Committee may reconsider whether it should appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to questions. Aggregate fees billed by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, for audit services related to the most recent two fiscal years, and for other professional services incurred in the most recent two fiscal years, were as follows: Type of Service 2017 2016 Audit Fees (1) $ 20.6 million $ 21.5 million Audit-Related Fees (2) — million — million Tax Fees (3) 1.6 million 1.5 million All Other Fees (4) 0.1 million 0.1 million Total $ 22.3 million $ 23.1 million (1) Comprises the audits of the Company’s annual financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting and reviews of the Company’s quarterly financial statements, as well as statutory audits of Company subsidiaries, attest services and consents to SEC filings. (2) Comprises employee benefit plan audits and consultations regarding financial accounting and reporting. (3) Comprises services for tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice. Tax compliance includes services for compliance related tax advice, as well as the preparation and review of both original and amended tax returns for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Tax compliance-related fees represented $0.3 million and $0.7 million of the tax fees for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The remaining tax fees primarily include tax advice. (4) Comprises other miscellaneous services. In accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Audit Committee established policies and procedures under which all audit and non-audit services performed by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee. During fiscal 2017, fees totaling $4,080, or less than 0.1% of total fees, were paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for two engagements that were not pre-approved. All such services were approved by the Audit Committee promptly after their inadvertent omission from pre-approval was noticed. During fiscal 2016, all such services performed by, and fees paid to, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were approved in advance. Board Recommendation The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote FOR ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2018. NIKE, INC. Ÿ 2017 Notice of Annual Meeting 41 PROPOSAL 6 Report of the Audit Committee The Audit Committee has: • Reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management. • Discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) Statement on Auditing Standards No. 16 Communications with Audit Committees. • Received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountants required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountants’ communications concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant’s independence. • Based on the review and discussions above, recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the last fiscal year for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
