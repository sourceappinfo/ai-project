Over the last twelve months, the Board has welcomed three new independent directors. These individuals complement and strengthen the Board's mix of skills and experiences, adding expertise across finance, business operations, technology, innovation, marketing, branding, and media. They also enhance the Board's overall balance of tenure and diversity. Looking ahead to this year's Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we have continued to evolve our proxy statement. As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, we have enhanced disclosures regarding our capital structure and engagement with shareholders. We have also made changes to formatting and organization to improve readability and clarity.

If any nominee becomes unable to serve, the holders of the proxies may, in their discretion, vote the shares for a substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board. The Bylaws and the Corporate Governance Guidelines of the Company provide that any nominee for director in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from their election than votes "for" such election shall tender their resignation for consideration by the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee.

The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee has determined that each director meets the qualification standards described below under "NIKE, Inc. Board of Directors—Director Nominations". In addition, the Board firmly believes that the experience, attributes, and skills of any single director nominee should not be viewed in isolation, but rather in the context of the experience, attributes, and skills that all director nominees bring to the Board as a whole, each of which contributes to the function of an effective Board.

DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS The Board of Directors takes an "evergreen" approach to Board refreshment, cultivating relationships with top talent on an ongoing basis. The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee identifies potential director candidates through a variety of means, including recommendations from members of the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee or the Board, suggestions from Company management, and shareholder recommendations. The committee may, in its discretion, engage director search firms to identify candidates. Shareholders may recommend director candidates for consideration by the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee by submitting a written recommendation to the committee, c/o Corporate Secretary, NIKE, Inc., One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. The recommendation should include the candidate's name, age, qualifications (including principal occupation and employment history), and written consent to be named as a nominee in the Company's proxy statement and to serve as a director, if elected. The Board of Directors has adopted qualification standards for the selection of non-management nominees for director, which can be found at our corporate website: http://investors.nike.com. As provided in these standards and the Company's corporate governance guidelines, nominees for director are selected on the basis of, among other things, distinguished business experience or other non-business achievements; education; significant knowledge of international business, finance, marketing, technology, human resources, diversity, equity, and inclusion, law, or other fields which are complementary to, and balance the knowledge of, other Board members; a desire to represent and serve the interests of all shareholders; independence; good character; ethics; sound judgment; diversity; and ability to devote substantial time to discharge Board responsibilities. The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee identifies qualified potential candidates without regard to their age, gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, or religion. While the Board has no policy regarding Board member diversity, the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee considers and discusses diversity in selecting nominees for director and in the re-nomination of an incumbent director. The committee views diversity broadly to include, among other things, differences in backgrounds, qualifications, experiences, viewpoint, geographic location, education, skills and expertise (including financial, accounting, compliance, corporate social responsibility, public policy, cybersecurity, or other expertise relevant to service on the Board), professional and industry experience, and personal characteristics (including gender, ethnicity/race, and sexual orientation). The Board believes that a variety and balance of perspectives on the Board results in more thoughtful and robust deliberations, and ultimately, better decisions. In considering the re-nomination of an incumbent director, the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee reviews the director's overall service to the Company during his or her term, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation, and quality of performance, as well as any special skills, experience, or diversity that such director brings to the Board. All potential new director candidates, whether recommended by shareholders or identified by other means, are initially screened by the Chair of the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee, who may seek additional information about the background and qualifications of the candidate, and who may determine that a candidate does not have qualifications that merit further consideration by the full committee. With respect to new director candidates who pass the initial screening, the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee meets to discuss and consider each candidate's qualifications and potential contributions to the Board, and determines by majority vote whether to recommend such candidate to the Board. The final decision to either appoint a candidate to fill a vacancy between annual meetings or include a candidate on the slate of nominees proposed at an annual meeting is made by the Board. It is the general policy of the Board that directors will not stand for re‑election after reaching the age of 72. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Pursuant to New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing rules, in order for a director to qualify as "independent", the Board of Directors must affirmatively determine that the director has no material relationship with the Company that would impair the director's independence. The Board affirmatively determined that commercial or charitable relationships below the following thresholds will not be considered material relationships that impair a director's independence: (1) if a NIKE director or immediate family member is an executive officer of another company that does business with NIKE and the annual sales to, or purchases from, NIKE are less than one percent of the annual revenues of the other company; and (2) if a NIKE director or immediate family member serves as an officer, director, or trustee of a charitable organization, and NIKE's contributions to the organization are less than one percent of that organization's total annual charitable receipts. After applying this categorical standard and the applicable NYSE independence standards, the Board has determined that the following directors who served during fiscal 2023 and/or will stand for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting—Cathleen Benko, Elizabeth Comstock, Timothy Cook, Thasunda Duckett, Mónica Gil, Alan Graf, Jr., Maria Henry, Peter Henry, Michelle Peluso, John Rogers, Jr., and Robert Swan—have no material relationship with the Company and, therefore, are independent. Messrs. John Donahoe II, Travis Knight, and Mark Parker were not independent pursuant to NYSE rules. Messrs. Donahoe and Parker were not independent pursuant to NYSE rules because they were employed by the Company during fiscal 2023. Mr. Knight was not independent pursuant to NYSE rules because he is the son of NIKE's co-founder and former Chairman of the Board, Mr. Philip Knight, who received compensation in excess of the 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 20 threshold set forth in applicable NYSE rules for his position as Chairman Emeritus. The compensation paid to Mr. Philip Knight is described in the section below titled "Additional Information—Transactions with Related Persons". BOARD STRUCTURE AND RESPONSIBILITIES The Board is currently composed of ten independent directors and three directors who are not independent under the NYSE listing rules. During fiscal 2023, there were four meetings of the Board and all of our directors attended at least 75 percent of the total number of meetings of the Board and committees on which he or she served. The Company encourages all directors to attend each annual meeting of shareholders, and all the directors then standing for election attended the 2022 annual meeting. BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE NIKE's governing documents provide the Board with flexibility to select the appropriate leadership structure of the Company. In determining the leadership structure, the Board considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business, fulfilling the duties of the Board, and the best interests of the Company's shareholders. Effective January 2020, the Company separated the position of Chair of the Board from the position of President and CEO, although this is not a permanent policy of the Board. The Executive Chairman, Mr. Mark Parker, presides over meetings of the Board of Directors and shareholders. The President and CEO, Mr. John Donahoe II, is in charge of the general supervision, direction, and control of the business and affairs of the Company, subject to the overall direction and supervision of the Board and its committees. Given the particular experience and tenure of Messrs. Parker and Donahoe, the Board believes this leadership structure is appropriate for the Company because it separates the leadership of the Board from the duties of day-to-day leadership of the Company. This structure permits Mr. Donahoe to primarily focus his time and attention on the business, while Mr. Parker directs his attention to the broad strategic issues considered by the Board of Directors. This structure works particularly well given the talent, experience and professional relationship of Messrs. Donahoe and Parker established during Mr. Donahoe's service on the Board beginning in 2014. In 2016, the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee established the position of lead independent director to ensure strong independent leadership of the Board. The position of Lead Independent Director is entrusted to execute the following functions: • serve as a liaison between the Chair and the independent directors; • approve the meeting agendas for the Board; • advise the Chair regarding the sufficiency, quality, quantity, and timeliness of information provided to the Board; • ensure that meeting schedules permit sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; • provide consultation and direct communication with major shareholders, if requested; • preside at meetings of the Board at which the Chair is not present, including executive sessions; and • perform other duties specified in the Lead Independent Director Charter. In June 2022, the Board re-appointed Mr. Timothy Cook to serve as Lead Independent Director for a term of three years. Mr. Cook continues to serve as Lead Independent Director of the Company working in collaboration with Messrs. Parker and Donahoe. The chairs of Board committees also play an active role in the leadership structure of the Board. The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee and the Board endeavor to select independent committee chairs who will provide strong leadership to guide the important work of the Board committees. Committee chairs work with the Company's senior executives to ensure the committees are discussing the key strategic risks and opportunities of the Company. In the absence of the Lead Independent Director, a presiding director is appointed to chair executive sessions of non-management directors (consisting of all directors other than Messrs. Parker and Donahoe). The position of presiding director is rotated among the chairs of the various Board committees, other than the Executive Committee. Executive sessions are regularly scheduled and held at least once each year. Mr. Philip Knight, co-founder and former Chairman of the Company, serves as Chairman Emeritus, with a standing invitation to attend meetings of the Board and its committees as a non-voting observer. The Board believes that it benefits from the valuable experience and insights of the Company's co-founder and former Chairman of the Board. For all of these reasons, the Board believes this leadership structure is optimal. 21 NIKE, INC. BOARD COMMITTEES The Board's current standing committees are an Audit & Finance Committee; a Compensation Committee; a Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee; and an Executive Committee. The Board may appoint other committees from time to time.

THE BOARD’S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT While the Company's management team is responsible for day-to-day management of the various risks facing the Company, the Board takes an active role in the oversight of the management of critical business risks. The Board does not view risk in isolation. Risks are considered in virtually every business decision and as part of NIKE's business strategy. The Board recognizes it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential for the Company to be competitive on a global basis and to achieve its strategic objectives. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through committees, which play a significant role in carrying out risk oversight. While the Audit & Finance Committee is responsible for oversight of management's risk management policies, oversight responsibility for particular areas of risk is allocated among the Board committees according to the committee's area of responsibility as reflected in the committee charters. BOARD COMMITTEES The AUDIT & FINANCE COMMITTEE oversees risks related to the Company's financial statements, the financial reporting process, accounting, legal matters, investments, access to capital and capital deployment, currency risk and hedging programs, information security (including risks related to cybersecurity), and data protection. The committee oversees the internal audit function, reviews a risk-based plan of internal audits, and reviews a risk-based integrated audit of internal controls over financial reporting. The committee meets separately with the Vice President of Global Audit and Chief Risk Officer, representatives of the independent registered public accountants, and senior management. The COMPENSATION COMMITTEE oversees risks associated with the Company's compensation philosophy and programs and executive succession and development. The CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY, SUSTAINABILITY & GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE oversees risks associated with corporate social purpose and company governance, including NIKE's Code of Conduct and its compliance programs, and the structure and performance of the Board and its committees. The committee also oversees protection of the Company's corporate reputation including issues that involve social and community engagement, workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion, and sustainability relating to the Company's products, its supply chain (including labor practices), and the environment. EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM Each committee chair works with one or more senior executives assigned to assist the committee in: developing agendas for the year and for each meeting, paying particular attention to areas of business risk identified by management, Board members, internal and external auditors, and in their committee charter; and scheduling agenda topics, presentations, and discussions regarding business risks within their area of responsibility. At meetings, the committees discuss areas of business risk, the potential impact, and management's initiatives to manage business risk, often within the context of important business decisions. Through this process, key business risk areas are reviewed at appropriate times, with some topics reviewed on multiple occasions throughout the year. At every Board meeting, each committee chair provides a report to the full Board outlining the committee's discussions and actions, including those affecting the oversight of various risks. The Company believes its leadership structure, discussed in detail above, supports the risk oversight function of the Board. Strong directors chair the various committees involved in risk oversight, there is open communication between management and directors, and all directors are involved in the risk oversight function. THE BOARD’S ROLE IN ESG OVERSIGHT The Board takes an active role overseeing NIKE's commitment to, and progress on, environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") matters. The Board oversees ESG matters primarily through the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 24 Committee. In addition to overseeing corporate governance (generally, the "G" in "ESG"), this committee also oversees the risks and opportunities associated with NIKE's Purpose to move the world forward through the power of sport, with a focus on the three pillars of people, planet, and play (generally, the "E" and "S" in "ESG"). The committee's responsibilities include reviewing and providing guidance to management regarding significant Purpose strategies, activities, policies, investments, and programs; reviewing the development of NIKE's five-year Purpose targets and long-term sustainability targets, and monitoring the Company's progress towards those targets; and reviewing and providing guidance to management regarding NIKE's annual Impact Report, which describes our progress towards our Purpose targets for our shareholders and other stakeholders. The Compensation Committee also plays a key role with respect to ESG by overseeing talent management and development for executive officers and senior management, including with respect to employee engagement and workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion. More information about Purpose, including NIKE's annual Impact Report, is available on the Impact section of our website. SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS WITH DIRECTORS Shareholders or interested parties desiring to communicate directly with the Board or with any individual director may do so in writing addressed to the intended recipient or recipients, c/o Corporate Secretary, NIKE, Inc., One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. The Office of the Corporate Secretary reviews all such communications and refers relevant correspondence directly to a director, as appropriate. In addition, the Office of the Corporate Secretary regularly summarizes for the Board all communications that relate to the functions of the Board or its committees or that otherwise warrant Board attention. CODE OF CONDUCT The NIKE Code of Conduct is available at the Company's corporate website, http://investors.nike.com, and will be provided in print without charge to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. The Code of Conduct applies to all of the Company's employees and directors, including our CEO and all other executive officers. The Code of Conduct provides that any waiver of the Code of Conduct for executive officers or directors may be made only by the Board or a committee of the Board. Any such waiver will be publicly disclosed, when required by law. The Company plans to disclose amendments to, and waivers from, the Code of Conduct on the Company's corporate website: http://investors.nike.com. CAPITAL STRUCTURE Since NIKE's initial public offering in 1980, the Company's articles of incorporation have provided for NIKE to have two classes of voting stock, consisting of the Class A Stock and the Class B Stock. RIGHTS AND HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK The shares of Class A Stock and Class B Stock have identical voting and economic rights except that the holders of the Class A Stock and Class B Stock vote as separate classes for purposes of electing directors. As long as the number of outstanding shares of Class B Stock is between 25% and 87.5% of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (as is currently the case), the holders of the Class B Stock, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect 25% of the Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number) and the holders of the Class A Stock, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect the remaining directors. If at any time the outstanding number of shares of Class A Stock is less than 12.5% of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, then the Class B Stock, voting as a separate class, will continue to have the right to elect 25% of the Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number), and the Class A Stock and Class B Stock will vote together as a single class to elect the remaining directors. Because there are currently thirteen directors on the Board and the outstanding number of shares of Class B Stock is between 25% and 87.5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the holders of the Class B Stock are entitled to elect four directors at the Annual Meeting and the holders of the Class A Stock are entitled to elect the remaining nine. On all other matters besides the election of directors (including Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), the Class A Stock and Class B Stock vote together as a single class, each with one vote per share. 25 NIKE, INC. Each share of Class A Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Stock. Such conversion is solely at the option of the holder, and cannot be dictated by either the Company or the Board. The Class A Stock is currently primarily held by Swoosh, LLC, an entity that was formed by Mr. Philip Knight, NIKE's co-founder, in 2015 to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Stock. For additional information regarding NIKE's classes of Common Stock, see the description of the Company's securities included as Exhibit 4.7 to NIKE's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023. For additional information regarding key holders of the Class A Stock and Class B Stock, see the section below titled "Stock Ownership Information—Stock Holdings of Certain Owners and Management". STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES Our unique capital structure enables NIKE to focus on long-term strategy, which our Board believes is critical to creating long-term value. This long-term vision has enabled the Company to prioritize research and development and innovation, to invest in transformations in support of our strategic objectives, and to integrate Purpose into our business strategy. It has also helped to preserve and advance NIKE's unique culture, which we believe powers our success. At the same time, our capital structure meaningfully protects and represents the interests of our public Class B shareholders. All of our directors, regardless of which class of Common Stock elected them, have fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of all NIKE shareholders. In addition, all directors are subject to the same nomination and evaluation processes, which are described in the section above titled "NIKE, Inc. Board of Directors—Director Nominations", and the Board considers all directors when assessing the mixture of experience, attributes, and skills represented on the Board. All of the directors elected by our Class B shareholders, as well as six out of nine of the directors elected by our Class A shareholders, are independent, and only independent directors sit on the Audit & Finance Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee. INVESTOR FEEDBACK Although the Board cannot change or eliminate our dual class capital structure without the approval of the holders of the Class A Stock, the Company believes it is important to engage regularly with Class B shareholders to understand their views on NIKE's capital structure. The majority of shareholders with whom we engaged since our last annual meeting expressed that they did not have concerns with the Company's dual class structure in light of the fact that it provides for equal voting and economic rights on all matters other than the election of directors, as well as the Company's long history of strong corporate governance practices, effective Board composition, and extensive shareholder engagement. However, some shareholders expressed a desire for the slate of Class B director nominees to include a member from each of the key Board committees and to be refreshed more frequently. In response to that feedback, the Company's Class B slate was updated for this Annual Meeting to include a balance of continuing and new Class B director nominees and to include a member of each of the three key Board committees: the Audit & Finance Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee. SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT Our approach to governance is informed by the insights and perspectives of our Class B shareholders. We greatly value the opportunity to engage with and solicit feedback from our shareholders regarding matters involving the Company, with a focus on ESG matters, and we believe that maintaining an open dialogue strengthens the Company's approach to its corporate governance practices and disclosures. Below is an overview of the Company's fiscal 2023 engagement practices regarding ESG matters. These ESG-related engagements take place in addition to regular financial-related outreach led by our Investor Relations team and engagement with shareholder proponents led by our Office of the Corporate Secretary. INTEGRATED ENGAGEMENT TEAM TYPES OF ENGAGEMENT KEY FY23 ENGAGEMENT TOPICS • Independent Directors • Investor Relations • Total Rewards and Executive Compensation • Office of the Corporate Secretary • Sustainability • Responsible Supply Chain • One-on-one meetings • Small group calls • E-mail communications • Board composition • Risk oversight • Capital structure • Executive compensation • Purpose strategy • Responsible sourcing • Environmental sustainability • Diversity, equity, and inclusion In fiscal 2023, we engaged with shareholders representing 52% of our Class B shares 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 26 The Board is committed to understanding the views of our shareholders. Therefore, independent members of our Board—consisting of the Chair of our Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee as well as our Lead Independent Director and Chair of our Compensation Committee—actively participated in engagements with certain of the Company's largest investors during fiscal 2023. In addition, management and our Board leadership ensures that key themes and feedback that emerge during these engagements are reported back to the full Board and any relevant committees, so that we can continue to refine and adapt our practices to better address the issues that our shareholders raise with us. The Board and management carefully consider and integrate shareholder feedback into the Company's practices and disclosures. Recent changes to our practices include refreshing the slate of Class B director nominees for this Annual Meeting (as described in the section above titled "Capital Structure—Investor Feedback"); refining our fiscal 2023 executive compensation program, including by increasing the proportion of the long-term incentive mix delivered in the form of performance-based restricted stock units (as described in the section below titled "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Summary—Say-on-Pay Results and Response"); and revising the NIKE, Inc. Policy on Public Policy and Political Activities in fiscal 2022 to increase transparency regarding political contributions. We have also enhanced our proxy statement disclosures over the past several years in response to shareholder feedback, including providing additional detail and transparency regarding Board diversity, Board oversight of ESG, and our capital structure.

DIRECTOR FEES AND ARRANGEMENTS Under our director compensation program in effect for fiscal 2023, non-employee directors receive: • An annual retainer of $100,000, paid in quarterly installments. • Upon appointment to the Board, a one-time, sign-on restricted stock award valued at $200,000 on the date of grant, generally, the date of appointment. The one-time, sign-on restricted stock award is subject to forfeiture in the event that service as a director terminates prior to the first anniversary of the date of grant. 27 NIKE, INC. • An annual restricted stock award valued at $200,000 on the date of grant, generally, the date of each annual meeting of shareholders. The number of restricted shares granted to each director for fiscal 2023 was determined by dividing the director's award value by the average closing price of our Class B Stock for the 20-trading day period ending on the date of grant. The annual restricted stock award is subject to forfeiture in the event that service as a director terminates prior to the earlier of the next annual meeting and the last day of the 12 th full calendar month following the date of grant. • For the Lead Independent Director, an annual retainer of $40,000, paid in quarterly installments. • For chairs of Board committees (other than the Executive Committee), an annual retainer of $25,000 for each committee chaired ($30,000 for the chair of the Audit & Finance Committee), paid in quarterly installments. • For Audit & Finance Committee members, an additional annual retainer of $5,000, paid in quarterly installments. • Payment or reimbursement of travel and other expenses incurred in attending Board meetings. • Matching charitable contributions under the NIKE Matching Gift Program, under which directors are eligible to contribute to qualified charitable organizations and the Company provides a matching contribution to the charities in an equal amount, up to $20,000 in the aggregate, for each director annually. Neither Mr. Donahoe nor Mr. Parker received any additional compensation for services provided as a director in fiscal 2023. STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES FOR DIRECTORS NIKE maintains stock ownership guidelines for all non-employee directors. Under these guidelines, directors are required to hold NIKE stock valued at five times their annual cash retainer. New directors are required to attain these ownership levels within five years of their election to the Board. Each of our directors has met or is on track to meet the specified ownership level. DIRECTOR PARTICIPATION IN DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN Under our Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors may elect in advance to defer up to 100 percent of the director fees paid by the Company. For a description of the plan, see the section below titled "Executive Compensation—Executive Compensation Tables—Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation in Fiscal 2023—Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans". 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 28 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL 2 SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we are submitting to shareholders our annual "say-on-pay proposal", an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as described in this proxy statement. At our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, approximately 65% of the votes cast on the say-on-pay proposal were voted in favor of the proposal, which indicated that there was a continuing opportunity for us to further understand our shareholders' feedback and take action to be responsive. Therefore, as further described in this section, during fiscal 2023 members of management and the Board continued to engage with shareholders to better understand and address their concerns. As discussed in this section, our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain top-tier talent and maximize shareholder value. To achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program and emphasize pay-for-performance principles, the Compensation Committee has continued to employ strong governance practices, including: • basing a majority of total compensation on performance and retention incentives; • setting incentive award targets based on clearly disclosed, objective performance measures; • mitigating undue risk associated with compensation by using multiple performance targets, caps on potential incentive payments, and a clawback policy; and • requiring executive officers to hold NIKE stock through published stock ownership guidelines. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board. However, the Board values shareholder opinions, and the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. BOARD RECOMMENDATION The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote FOR approval of the following resolution: RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the fiscal 2023 compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables). 29 NIKE, INC.

Stock Incentive Plan 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 30 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY SAY-ON-PAY RESULTS AND RESPONSE SCOPE OF OUTREACH & ENGAGEMENT Our annual say-on-pay vote is one of our opportunities to receive feedback from shareholders regarding our executive compensation program, and as such is taken very seriously by the Compensation Committee and Board. In 2022, our executive compensation program received the support of approximately 65% of the total votes cast at our annual meeting of shareholders. This reflected a slight decrease in support compared to the 2021 say-on-pay vote, indicating to the Compensation Committee and the Board that there was an opportunity to further understand and consider investor perspectives on the recent changes to our compensation program and take additional responsive actions to address any ongoing concerns. As a result, we continued to actively seek feedback from shareholders and build on our record of responsiveness, reaching out to shareholders owning approximately 50% of outstanding shares of our Class B Stock and speaking with shareholders owning approximately 48% of outstanding shares of our Class B Stock. Our Lead Independent Director and Compensation Committee Chair, Timothy Cook, and our Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee Chair, Michelle Peluso, participated in conversations with shareholders owning approximately 22% of outstanding shares of our Class B Stock. All feedback was shared with the Board and helped to shape the changes made to our executive compensation program and related disclosure, as set forth in this year's CD&A. Engaged with 100% of our top 10 institutional shareholders Through this engagement, we learned that shareholders were generally supportive of changes made to our compensation program over the past two years, which have strengthened the alignment of our executives’ interests with those of our shareholders, continued our practice of tying compensation to progress on our Purpose targets, and reinforced our one-team culture. Shareholders also provided helpful feedback on fiscal 2022 compensation decisions and the continued evolution of our long-term incentive program, which informed a number of responsive actions described below. While some shareholders understood the rationale for adjustments to the fiscal 2022 PSP given the unforeseen continued impacts of COVID-related disruptions in key geographies, others sought further clarification regarding the Compensation Committee's decision-making process, including its consideration of retention implications and its application of discretion under our "pay for performance" philosophy. During our conversations with shareholders, we discussed the challenges of setting rigorous targets in light of market uncertainty and the desire among shareholders to maintain a program design that prioritizes pay for performance and retention of top-tier talent, and aligns executive incentives with shareholder interests. These continue to be top priorities for NIKE, as reflected in our practices and disclosures with respect to our fiscal 2023 PSP. We also discussed the continued evolution of the structure of our long-term incentive program, after replacing the cash-based LTIP awards with stock-based PSU awards beginning with the fiscal 2022 – 2024 performance period. This marked a significant shift in NIKE's program structure, and therefore required a transition period to phase-in delivering 50% of the long-term incentive awards in the form of PSUs. Shareholders broadly appreciated this commitment, but some expressed the desire for additional clarity on the specific timeline. The proportion of the total long-term incentive mix delivered in the form of PSUs was significantly increased for fiscal 2023 for all executive officers (excluding the Executive Chairman, who did not receive any new LTIP or PSU awards after fiscal 2021), and the phase-in will be completed with the fiscal 2024 awards. Shareholders also appreciated our additional proxy disclosure, including the Annual Direct Compensation Table, explaining the artificially inflated values in the Summary Compensation Table due to the shift to PSUs, which we have continued to provide in this year's proxy statement. Our engagements with shareholders also provided the opportunity to discuss our continued incorporation of the "People & Planet" modifier into long-term incentive awards. Shareholders appreciated our thoughtful approach to the incorporation of progress on our Purpose targets as a consideration in executive compensation and supported the continued incorporation of the modifier. The fiscal 2021 – 2023 LTIP awards are the first to feature this modifier, and we have included robust disclosure in this CD&A regarding the methodology and rationale underlying the earnout, in line with feedback received from shareholders. The Board and Compensation Committee greatly value these engagements with shareholders and are committed to maintaining ongoing dialogue and incorporating shareholder feedback into the design of the executive compensation program going forward. 31 NIKE, INC. The following table summarizes feedback themes we heard from shareholders and actions taken to be responsive: WHAT WE HEARD HOW WE RESPONDED Shareholders supported increasing the proportion of the total long-term incentive mix (PSUs, stock options, and RSUs) delivered in the form of PSUs to 50%, and recommended clarifying the timeline for implementing that change • For fiscal 2023 awards, significantly increased the proportion of the total long-term incentive mix delivered in the form of PSUs to all executive officers who received PSUs, with 46% of CEO awards delivered as PSUs • For fiscal 2024 awards, increasing the proportion of the total long-term incentive mix delivered in the form of PSUs to 50% for all executive officers who receive PSUs • Committed to maintain at least 50% PSUs on a go-forward basis Shareholders had mixed reactions to adjusting upwards the payout for fiscal 2022 PSP awards, with some shareholders objecting to the principal of upward adjustments and other shareholders supporting the adjustment based on the specific circumstances and methodology • Confirmed that the Compensation Committee generally seeks to avoid upward adjustments to incentive plan payouts, and carefully considers any such adjustments to ensure the compensation program continues to pay for performance and retain top-tier talent Shareholders continued to support the inclusion of the People & Planet modifier in long-term incentive awards, and expressed interest in understanding the methodology underlying long-term incentive award payout determinations • Continued incorporating People & Planet modifier in fiscal 2023 – 2025 PSU awards • Provided robust disclosure in this proxy statement regarding the methodology and rationale underlying the earnout of the People & Planet modifier for the 2021 – 2023 LTIP awards (the first awards to feature this modifier) Shareholders understood that replacing cash-based LTIP awards with PSUs would artificially inflate values in the Summary Compensation Table for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 due to SEC rules • Continued to include the Fiscal 2023 Annual Direct Compensation Table to clearly communicate how the Compensation Committee views compensation awarded for fiscal 2023 GUIDING COMPENSATION PRINCIPLES • To drive business results and maximize shareholder value, our executive compensation is highly incentive-based. • To emphasize long-term performance, increase alignment between executives and shareholders, and support retention, incentive compensation is weighted towards long-term awards. • To foster teamwork and ensure internal pay equity, we utilize a cohort approach by aligning compensation across executive roles. • To ensure that our executive compensation program supports our business strategy and talent plan, we determine cohort compensation levels by holistically considering factors relating to our business, the competitive market for top-tier talent, and the applicable executives. ANNUAL DIRECT COMPENSATION ELEMENTS NIKE's annual direct compensation for the Named Executive Officers generally consists of the following elements: ELEMENT KEY CHARACTERISTICS PURPOSE Base Salary Fixed cash compensation Provides market competitive baseline compensation to attract and retain top-tier talent Annual Cash Incentive Award – PSP Variable cash incentive compensation earned at 0% – 150% based on Company performance over a 1-year performance period Motivates and rewards achievement of sustainable and profitable growth Long-Term Incentive Awards – SIP PSUs (1) Variable stock-based incentive compensation earned at 0% – 200% based on Company performance over a 3-year performance period; value dependent upon achievement of performance metrics and our stock price Aligns NEOs' interests with those of our shareholders by motivating and rewarding achievement of long-term shareholder value and growth; promotes retention Stock Options Stock-based incentive compensation that generally vests in 4 equal annual installments; only provides value if our stock price appreciates Aligns NEOs' interests with those of our shareholders by rewarding achievement of upside potential; promotes retention RSUs Stock-based incentive compensation that generally vests in 3 equal annual installments; value tied to our stock price Aligns NEOs' interests with those of our shareholders by rewarding long-term value creation; promotes retention (1) Prior to fiscal year 2022, this portion of annual direct compensation was delivered in the form of cash-based awards under our LTIP. LTIP awards granted in fiscal 2021 were earned based on Company performance over fiscal years 2021 – 2023; their payout is described in the section below titled "Compensation of our Named Executive Officers—Long-Term Incentive—Fiscal 2021 Award Results" and included in the Summary Compensation Table as part of fiscal 2023 compensation due to SEC rules. There are no other outstanding LTIP awards. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 32 FISCAL 2023 ANNUAL DIRECT COMPENSATION TABLE In fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee replaced cash-based LTIP awards with PSUs. Both types of awards are earned based on Company performance over a three-year performance period. Because SEC rules require that we report in the Summary Compensation Table cash-based incentive awards for the year earned and stock-based incentive awards for the year granted, for fiscal 2023 the Summary Compensation Table reflects both the payout of the fiscal 2021 – 2023 LTIP awards (which were awarded as part of fiscal 2021 annual compensation) and the grant of the fiscal 2023 – 2025 PSUs (which were awarded as part of fiscal 2023 annual compensation). The table below supplements the Summary Compensation Table, which appears on page 44. By excluding (1) the payout of the fiscal 2021 – 2023 LTIP awards and (2) perquisites, including the enhanced charitable match benefits provided to Messrs. Donahoe and Parker that are not actually received by these executives, we believe that the table below more accurately reflects how the Compensation Committee views fiscal 2023 annual direct compensation.

COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES AND STRUCTURE Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain top-tier talent in a competitive marketplace and to maximize shareholder value by rewarding NEOs for strong Company performance. The program generally consists of annual direct compensation, with a focus on incentive compensation, and competitive benefits that are generally consistent with the benefits offered to our other U.S.-based employees. We structure our executive compensation program in the context of our business strategy and talent plan. To foster teamwork and ensure internal pay equity, we utilize a segmented cohort approach that aligns compensation across certain executive roles. Cohort compensation levels are determined by holistically considering factors such as future potential, individual performance, market insights, succession planning, retention, and leadership continuity. New executives are phased into a cohort by taking into consideration their relative experience, expected contributions, and market position. Our philosophy is to "pay for performance" in order to drive business results and maximize shareholder value. As a result, executive compensation is highly incentive-based and weighted towards long-term awards to emphasize long-term performance and support retention. Our executive compensation program balances performance incentives, including by using multiple performance metrics and periods, and through a mixture of cash- and stock-based compensation elements. Stock-based compensation—which consists of PSUs, stock options, and RSUs—is also structured to pay for performance by linking the majority of each NEO's target total annual direct compensation directly to our stock price. The following chart illustrates the mix of components that make up fiscal 2023 target total annual direct compensation for our CEO. BASE SALARY Base salary is a fixed element of compensation that serves to attract and retain top-tier talent. Generally, the Compensation Committee reviews and determines base salaries for our Named Executive Officers in June, with any adjustments becoming effective in August of the same year. For fiscal 2023, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Friend's base salary to align with his applicable cohort. Base salaries for each other NEO remained unchanged compared to fiscal 2022.

PSP awards reflect our "pay for performance" philosophy: they are earned between 0% and 150% of target based on Company performance during the fiscal year. The Compensation Committee retains discretion to adjust PSP metrics and award payouts based on individual or Company performance. To align employees and reinforce our one-team culture, the same compensation philosophy and metrics that underlie our PSP awards generally apply to all global employees who are eligible to participate in the Company's success through annual incentive bonuses. For fiscal 2023, the Compensation Committee maintained PSP target awards for each Named Executive Officer at the same level as his or her fiscal 2022 PSP target award. Therefore, the fiscal 2023 PSP target awards were: NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER FISCAL 2023 PSP TARGET AWARD (% OF BASE SALARY) John Donahoe II 200% Mark Parker 0% Matthew Friend 120% Andrew Campion 120% Heidi O'Neill 120% In June 2022, the Compensation Committee selected three equally-weighted metrics for the fiscal 2023 PSP awards, designed to support our strategic priorities and drive sustainable and profitable growth. Consistent with the prior year, the fiscal 2023 PSP metrics consisted of: (1) Adjusted Revenue, to drive topline income; (2) Adjusted Digital Revenue, to support digital growth in connection with our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy; and (3) Adjusted EBIT, to manage overall profitability. Also consistent with the prior year, the committee maintained a single, year-long performance period and set year-long goals for each metric. In setting the year-long performance goals for the PSP, the Compensation Committee sought to drive sustainable and profitable growth in the context of a business environment characterized by significant potential volatility. In particular, the committee anticipated potential volatility due to outsized macro-economic factors, such as the impact of inflationary pressures on consumer confidence, and geopolitical factors. Accordingly, the Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Digital Revenue target goals represented an increase of 6% and 15%, respectively, compared to actual fiscal 2022 revenue and digital revenue. The Adjusted EBIT target goal represented a decrease of 4% compared to actual fiscal 2022 EBIT, reflecting anticipated currency headwinds. Threshold and maximum goals for each metric were set non-equidistant from the applicable target goal, with additional downside stretch to balance achievability (in support of continued retention) with appropriate upside stretch (to incentivize and reward exceptional performance). In support of our one-team culture, the fiscal 2023 broad-based annual bonus plan (applicable to employees below the executive officer level) used the same metrics as the PSP and also weighted them equally. However, the broad-based annual bonus plan used two equally-weighted, six-month performance periods to reduce the potential impact of volatility and thereby enable more aggressive target setting. To balance the commitment to a year-long performance period for the PSP with support for our one-team culture, the Compensation Committee determined in June 2022 that the payout level for the fiscal 2023 PSP would not exceed the payout level for the fiscal 2023 broad-based annual bonus plan, and committed to use its negative discretion to reduce the PSP payout level if necessary. For fiscal 2023, Adjusted Revenue of $52.6 billion corresponded to an earnout of 150%, Adjusted Digital Revenue of $13.7 billion corresponded to an earnout of 137%, and Adjusted EBIT of $7.2 billion corresponded to an earnout of 147%. The earnouts for the three equally-weighted metrics were averaged together to calculate a PSP earnout of 145%. The Compensation Committee then considered that the payout level for the broad-based annual bonus plan (applicable to employees below the executive officer level) was 119% as a result of that plan using six-month performance periods. Consistent with our one-team culture as well as the Compensation Committee's determination at the beginning of fiscal 2023 that the PSP payout level would not exceed the payout level under the broad-based annual bonus plan, the committee reduced the payout level under the fiscal 2023 PSP to 119% for all executive officers. The fiscal 2023 PSP performance goals and achievement levels, and the Compensation Committee's decision-making, are illustrated below. 35 NIKE, INC.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE Long-term incentive compensation incentivizes and rewards long-term Company performance, aligns executives' interests with those of our shareholders, and promotes retention in a highly competitive talent marketplace. Therefore, this element of our executive compensation program forms the largest portion of our Named Executive Officers' annual direct compensation, constituting 79% of fiscal 2023 target total annual direct compensation for Mr. Donahoe (67% for each other NEO). Fiscal 2023 long-term incentive compensation consisted of three components: PSUs, stock options, and RSUs, each granted under our SIP. For fiscal 2023 awards, the Compensation Committee began evolving the long-term incentive award mix towards delivering 50% of the total award in the form of PSUs (excluding Mr. Parker, whose long-term incentive award is smaller and delivered entirely in the form of stock options due to his role as Executive Chairman). Accordingly, the committee significantly increased the proportion of PSUs for the fiscal 2023 long-term incentive awards, with Mr. Donahoe's award delivered 46% in the form of PSUs and the awards for each of Messrs. Friend and Campion and Ms. O'Neill delivered 36% in the form of PSUs. The evolution towards delivering 50% of the total long-term incentive award in the form of PSUs will be completed with the fiscal 2024 awards. FISCAL 2023 AWARD GRANTS The Compensation Committee determined the fiscal 2023 long-term incentive awards in June 2022. In setting the value of the total long-term incentive award, the committee considered multiple factors, including individual and Company performance, evolving responsibilities, our cohort compensation approach, and retaining top-tier talent in a highly competitive talent marketplace. With respect to the mix of the long-term incentive award components, the Compensation Committee began to phase in an increase in the proportion delivered in PSUs. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee increased the target value of Mr. Donahoe's PSU award by $2,900,000 compared to fiscal 2022, maintained his stock option award at the same amount, and decreased his RSU award by $1,400,000. Given Mr. Parker's responsibilities as Executive Chairman, the committee maintained his same award value and mix compared to fiscal 2022. With respect to each other NEO, the Compensation Committee increased the target value of the PSU award by $1,000,000 to reflect the factors described above. The committee also increased Mr. Friend's stock option and RSU awards by $300,000 and $200,000, respectively, to align with his applicable cohort. The fiscal 2023 long-term incentive award values were: 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 36 NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER TARGET PSUs STOCK OPTIONS RSUs TOTAL FISCAL 2023 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS John Donahoe II $7,900,000 $6,300,000 $2,800,000 $17,000,000 Mark Parker — $2,000,000 — $2,000,000 Matthew Friend $2,000,000 $2,100,000 $1,400,000 $5,500,000 Andrew Campion $2,000,000 $2,100,000 $1,400,000 $5,500,000 Heidi O'Neill $2,000,000 $2,100,000 $1,400,000 $5,500,000 FISCAL 2023 – 2025 PSUs PSUs align our Named Executive Officers' interests with those of our shareholders by motivating and rewarding achievement of long-term shareholder value and growth. PSU awards reflect our "pay for performance" philosophy: they are earned between 0% and 200% of target based on Company performance during a three-year performance period. In June 2022, the Compensation Committee selected the metric, corresponding performance goals, and award terms for the fiscal 2023 – 2025 PSU awards. The committee will determine the earnout of the fiscal 2023 – 2025 PSU awards following the completion of the three-year performance period, and any PSUs that are earned will vest on August 1, 2025. Consistent with the prior year's awards, the Compensation Committee selected Relative TSR as the metric for the fiscal 2023 – 2025 PSU awards and continued to target above-median performance as shown in the table below: FISCAL 2023 – 2025 PERFORMANCE GOALS % PAYOUT THRESHOLD 25% TARGET 100% MAXIMUM 200% Relative TSR 1 (1) Relative TSR for fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025, calculated using the 20-trading day average stock price and assuming that dividends paid during the performance period are reinvested in the applicable company's stock. PSUs will be earned at 100% of target if the Company's Relative TSR for the performance period is at the 55 th percentile, and will be earned at 0% if the Company's Relative TSR for the performance period is below the 25 th percentile. PSU earnout based on Relative TSR performance is subject to a cap of 100% of target if Absolute TSR for the performance period is negative. The Compensation Committee selected three-year Relative TSR as the performance metric because it is an objective and transparent measure of long-term shareholder value, especially in the context of a volatile market. Furthermore, the cap on payout if Absolute TSR is negative incentivizes NEOs to pursue long-term growth. The fiscal 2023 – 2025 PSU awards also contain a People & Planet modifier designed to support our commitment to Purpose, which is a key component of our long-term strategy. If Relative TSR meets or exceeds the threshold performance goal, the People & Planet modifier permits the Compensation Committee to adjust the earnout upwards or downwards by up to 20 percentage points (subject to both the 200% maximum earnout and the 100% Absolute TSR cap) based on a holistic assessment of the Company's performance with respect to employee engagement and inclusion, leadership diversity, and sustainability. Structuring the modifier as a holistic assessment ensures that the final earnout comprehensively balances these broad and disparate issues and appropriately reflects the spirit of our Purpose commitment. In determining the People & Planet modifier, the Compensation Committee will consider the Company's progress towards achieving certain of the five-year Purpose targets described in our fiscal 2022 Impact Report, including goals regarding increasing representation of women in our global corporate workforce and leadership positions; increasing representation of U.S. racial and ethnic minorities in our U.S. corporate workforce and at the Director level and above; employee feedback with respect to engagement and inclusion; foundational expectations related to responsible manufacturing in our supply chain; and operating more sustainably with respect to carbon, waste, water, and chemistry. The target number of PSUs granted to each Named Executive Officer for fiscal 2023 was determined by dividing the NEO's target award value by the average closing price of our Class B Stock for the 20-trading day period ending on the date of grant. PSUs accumulate dividend equivalents that are paid only when, and to the extent, they vest. To promote retention, PSU awards generally provide that any unvested PSUs are forfeited if the Named Executive Officer leaves the Company. Forfeiture is subject to partial accelerated vesting upon termination of employment in connection with a divestiture or reduction in force (as described in the section below titled "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control"). STOCK OPTIONS Stock options align our Named Executive Officers' interests with those of our shareholders by rewarding the achievement of upside potential, and they reflect our "pay for performance" philosophy by rewarding the NEOs only if the price of our Class B Stock appreciates. 37 NIKE, INC. The number of stock options granted to each NEO for fiscal 2023 was determined by dividing the NEO's award value by the Black-Scholes value (calculated based on a 20-day average stock price and the available five-year and seven-year interest rates) of a stock option on the date of grant. Options granted to the Named Executive Officers vest in equal annual installments over four years and have an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant (or the trading day immediately prior to the grant date, if the grant date is not a trading day). To promote retention, stock options generally provide that if a Named Executive Officer leaves the Company, they forfeit any unvested stock options. Forfeiture is subject to a limited retirement provision designed to encourage executives to delay retirement, as well as partial accelerated vesting upon termination of employment in connection with a divestiture or reduction in force (each as described in the section below titled "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control"). RSUs RSUs align our Named Executive Officers' interests with those of our shareholders by rewarding the achievement of long-term value creation, and they reflect our "pay for performance" philosophy because their value is directly tied to our Class B Stock price. The number of RSUs granted to each NEO for fiscal 2023 was determined by dividing the NEO's award value by the average closing price of our Class B Stock for the 20-trading day period ending on the date of grant. RSUs granted to the Named Executive Officers as part of long-term incentive compensation vest in equal annual installments over three years and accumulate dividend equivalents that are paid only upon vesting. To promote retention, RSU awards generally provide that any unvested RSUs are forfeited if the Named Executive Officer leaves the Company. Forfeiture is subject to partial accelerated vesting upon termination of employment in connection with a divestiture or reduction in force (as described in the section below titled "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control"). FISCAL 2021 AWARD RESULTS In fiscal 2021, the long-term incentive compensation mix included cash-based awards under our LTIP. LTIP awards were replaced by PSUs beginning with fiscal 2022 awards. As previously disclosed in our 2021 proxy statement, the fiscal 2021 – 2023 LTIP awards granted in June 2020 were to be earned between 0% and 200% of target based on Relative TSR over a three-year performance period (subject to a payout cap of 100% if Absolute TSR was negative). In addition, if Relative TSR was achieved at or above the threshold performance goal, a People & Planet modifier would allow the award payout to be increased by up to 25 percentage points (subject to both the 200% maximum earnout and the 100% Absolute TSR cap) based on a holistic assessment of the Company's performance with respect to employee engagement and inclusion, leadership diversity, and sustainability. NIKE's Relative TSR for fiscal years 2021 – 2023 was at the 37 th percentile, corresponding to an earnout of 54%, and Absolute TSR for that period was positive. Relative TSR was calculated in comparison to the companies that were included in the S&P 500 as of May 31, 2023, using the 20-trading day average stock price and assuming that dividends paid during the performance period were reinvested in the applicable company's stock. In June 2023, the Compensation Committee considered the People & Planet modifier. To support the Company's Purpose priorities—and to base the holistic assessment in data and quantitative metrics—the committee reviewed NIKE's progress towards our 2025 Purpose targets, which are challenging five-year targets that focus and objectivize our Purpose work. Specifically, the committee reviewed 14 targets: • Inclusive culture and engagement : one target regarding employee engagement and inclusion • Leadership diversity : three targets regarding representation in both the corporate workforce generally and in senior positions, for women globally and U.S. racial and ethnic minorities • Sustainability : all nine Planet targets, covering issues regarding carbon, waste, water, and chemistry • Foundational expectations : one target that addresses labor, health, safety, and environmental standards for facilities in our extended supply chain More detail about each of these targets is available in NIKE's fiscal 2022 Impact Report, which is available on the Impact section of our website. In determining the modifier, the Compensation Committee considered the significant progress made on these targets as of May 31, 2022, as reflected in the fiscal 2022 Impact Report. The committee considered the breadth of achievements, as indicated by strong progress for nine of the fourteen targets, including each leadership diversity target. The Compensation Committee also noted key sustainability work related to greenhouse gas emissions, waste diversion, and freshwater usage, as well as the ambitious expansion of the compliance program in connection with the foundational expectations target. The Compensation Committee supplemented the 2025 Purpose targets progress reflected in the Impact Report with additional quantitative and qualitative information, including continued progress on both People and Planet initiatives during fiscal 2023 as well as employee sentiment reported through employee engagement surveys. Based on this holistic assessment, the Compensation Committee determined a People & Planet modifier of 10%. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 38 As illustrated below, combining the Relative TSR earnout of 54% with the People & Planet modifier of 10% resulted in a total payout of 64% for each of the NEOs. FISCAL 2021 – 2023 PERFORMANCE RESULTS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE METRIC % PAYOUT THRESHOLD 25% TARGET 100% MAXIMUM 200% Relative TSR EARNOUT: 54% PEOPLE & PLANET MODIFIER • Solid and sustained progress towards both People and Planet initiatives throughout the performance period • Broad scope of achievements reflected in the significant progress on nine of the fourteen 2025 Purpose targets, as reported in the fiscal 2022 Impact Report • Breadth of achievement balanced by depth of achievement, including key sustainability work related to greenhouse gas emissions, waste diversion, and freshwater usage MODIFIER: 10% TOTAL PAYOUT 64% OTHER COMPENSATION PROFIT SHARING AND RETIREMENT PLANS We maintain a U.S. tax qualified retirement savings plan—the 401(k) Plan—under which all eligible U.S. employees, including the Named Executive Officers, are able to make pre-tax and after-tax contributions from their cash compensation. We make annual matching contributions for all participants equal to 100% of their pre-tax contributions up to 5% of their total eligible compensation. The Internal Revenue Code limits the amount of compensation that can be deferred under the 401(k) Plan, and also limits the amount of salary and annual cash incentive award ($305,000 for fiscal 2023) that may be taken into account when determining contributions under that plan. Accordingly, we provide our Named Executive Officers and other highly compensated employees with the opportunity to defer their compensation, including amounts in excess of the tax law limit, under our nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. We do not match deferrals to the Deferred Compensation Plan. Balances in the Deferred Compensation Plan, including the balances of the Named Executive Officers, are unsecured and at-risk, meaning that the balances may be forfeited in the event of the Company's financial distress, such as bankruptcy. Fiscal 2023 matching contributions to the Named Executive Officers under the 401(k) Plan are included in the All Other Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table on page 44. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees in the United States and in many countries outside of the United States, including the Named Executive Officers, to purchase Class B Stock through payroll deductions at a 15% discount to the market price on the first or last trading day of the six-month purchase period, depending on which day the stock price was lower. 39 NIKE, INC. PERQUISITES AND OTHER BENEFITS Our executive compensation program includes limited perquisites and other personal benefits for our Named Executive Officers, which generally consist of home security and financial planning services. Given the nature of our business, from time to time certain Company employees, including certain executive officers, may also receive Company product, event tickets, or travel benefits that are not generally offered to all employees. In addition, Mr. Donahoe and Mr. Parker are entitled to limited personal use of Company aircraft, primarily pursuant to time sharing agreements, which is intended to increase the security, availability, and productivity of these individuals. They are also entitled to enhanced charitable gift matching under our Employee Matching Gift Program—a program designed to encourage and support employees in giving back to our communities and creating positive change—with an executive contribution limit of $1,000,000 per calendar year and Company matching on a 4:1 basis. Our Employee Matching Gift Program does not match employee contributions that benefit the employee, including contributions to the employee's personal or family foundation or to a non-profit organization that is managed or led by, or provides compensation or assistance to, the employee or a member of their family. Because the Employee Matching Gift Program is managed on a calendar year basis while the Summary Compensation Table reports compensation for the fiscal year, the charitable matching amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table may exceed $4,000,000 (up to a maximum of $8,000,000) due to the timing of charitable contributions. For fiscal 2023, Mr. Donahoe and Mr. Parker each donated to a range of charitable causes. We do not provide any tax gross-ups on perquisites to our executive officers. Greater detail about the perquisites and personal benefits provided to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2023 is provided in the footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table on page 44. NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENTS In exchange for non-competition agreements from each of our Named Executive Officers, we have agreed to provide monthly payments during the non-compete period following termination of employment, as described in the section below titled "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control". We believe that it is appropriate to compensate individuals to refrain from working with competitors following termination, and that compensation enhances the enforceability of such agreements. LETTER AGREEMENTS We do not have employment contracts with any of our executive officers, other than letter agreements with Messrs. Donahoe and Parker that provide for the enhanced charitable matching benefit described in the section above titled "Perquisites and Other Benefits". 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 40 OUR COMPENSATION PROCESS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE The Compensation Committee oversees our executive compensation program, including determining the value and composition of the compensation package for each of our executive officers and setting annual performance goals for the CEO. In addition to any special actions the Compensation Committee may take throughout the year, the committee generally acts with respect to compensation for our Named Executive Officers during the fiscal year as follows: PEER GROUP Given the competitive market for top-tier talent, the Compensation Committee uses a peer group (consisting of companies with similar revenue size, market capitalization, brand value, products, or markets, or with which we compete for executive talent, or which are aligned with our evolving business and talent strategies) to provide a reference for assessing executive compensation levels and practices. Based on the criteria, the following peer group was considered for purposes of setting fiscal 2023 executive compensation: American Express Company Microsoft Corporation salesforce.com, inc. Best Buy Company, Inc. Mondelez International, Inc. Starbucks Corporation The Coca-Cola Company Netflix, Inc. Target Corporation Kimberly-Clark Corporation Oracle Corporation TJX Companies Lowe's Companies, Inc. Pepsico, Inc. Walmart Inc. McDonald's Corporation Procter & Gamble Company The Walt Disney Company In addition to considering our peer group, the Compensation Committee also uses market survey data from third parties, including Aon, Willis Towers Watson, and Mercer, about a broader range of companies. The Compensation Committee generally does not set executive compensation at or near any particular percentile of peer group, or market, compensation. Instead, the committee considers compensation to be competitive if it is generally within a reasonable range of market median. 41 NIKE, INC. ROLE OF MANAGEMENT The CEO makes compensation recommendations to, and participates in discussions with, the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation of each executive officer other than himself. In addition, our human resources staff regularly provides data, analysis, and recommendations to the committee regarding executive compensation. The Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive session without the CEO or other management present to discuss our executive compensation program. Such executive sessions include discussions about, among other topics, the CEO's performance and compensation and the design and operation of our executive compensation plans. ROLE OF COMPENSATION CONSULTANT The Compensation Committee has the authority, in its sole discretion, to retain compensation consultants to assist the committee in overseeing our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee chose not to retain any such consultants in fiscal 2023. However, in connection with the committee's analysis and decision-making regarding the fiscal 2023 executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee supplemented peer group data with information from surveys and reports containing competitive market data from Aon, Willis Towers Watson, and Mercer, which are obtained by our human resources staff. OTHER COMPENSATION PRACTICES STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES We maintain stock ownership guidelines for executive officers that are designed to further align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders. Under the guidelines, each executive officer is required to hold NIKE stock valued at the following multiple of their annual base salary: POSITION OWNERSHIP LEVEL Chief Executive Officer 8X Base Salary Other Executive Officers (including NEOs) 3X Base Salary New executive officers are required to attain these ownership levels within five years of their appointment. As of May 31, 2023, the CEO and each of our other executive officers, including each other Named Executive Officer, has met or is on track to meet the applicable ownership guideline within the requisite period. HEDGING AND PLEDGING The Company's Blackout and Pre-clearance Policy (which supplements our Insider Trading Policy) prohibits directors, executive officers, and other designated insiders (based on seniority and department) from engaging in transactions involving hedging, monetization, or short sales of NIKE stock, including zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts. The policy also requires directors and executive officers, along with members of their families and households, to obtain pre-approval from the Company's Chairman or CEO before pledging NIKE stock. Before any such approval is granted, the Company's Clearance Director considers the size of the pledge relative to the individual's other holdings, both direct and indirect, and NIKE's shares outstanding; the risk of foreclosure given the nature of the associated transaction; protections against the appearance of insider trading, including prohibitions on sales during trading blackouts; and the ability to timely report sales on Form 4. CHANGE-IN-CONTROL PROVISIONS Neither PSP nor LTIP awards are subject to acceleration upon a change in control. PSU, stock option, and RSU awards are subject only to "double-trigger" accelerated change-in-control vesting (with PSUs vesting at 100% of target), meaning that vesting is accelerated only if there is a change in control of the Company, and within the following two years, either the acquiring entity fails to assume the awards or the employee's employment is terminated by the acquirer without cause or by the employee for good reason. This double-trigger acceleration is intended to encourage executive retention through a period of uncertainty. The Compensation Committee believes that this approach will enhance shareholder value in the context of an acquisition and align executives' interests with those of investors. The effect of change-in-control transactions on stock-based awards is described further in the section below titled "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control". 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 42 CLAWBACK We maintain a clawback policy for the recoupment of incentive compensation. Under the clawback policy, an executive officer who is involved in wrongful conduct that results in a restatement of the Company's financial statements must repay to the Company up to the full amount of any incentive compensation that was paid based on the financial statements that were subsequently restated. The clawback policy covers PSP awards, LTIP awards, SIP awards (based on excess proceeds from pre-restatement sales of stock acquired pursuant to the stock-based awards), and profit sharing contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan. In addition to the clawback policy, the PSP, LTIP, and SIP also specify that the Committee may apply further clawback requirements to awards through additional clawback policies or award agreement provisions, and that all awards are subject to clawback requirements under applicable law and regulation. The Company will adopt a revised clawback policy regarding accounting restatements in connection with the SEC's adoption of new rules to implement Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, once such final rules, as implemented by NYSE, become effective. RISK ASSESSMENT At the Compensation Committee's request, management prepared an assessment of potential risks associated with the Company's fiscal 2023 compensation programs, including any risk that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. This included an assessment of risks associated with each element of executive compensation. The assessment considered certain design features of the compensation program that reduce the likelihood of excessive risk taking, such as reasonable performance targets, capped incentive compensation payouts, a balance of short- and long-term incentives, a balance of cash- and stock-based incentives, vesting of awards over time, and the potential for clawback of incentive compensation. In addition, for stock-based compensation, we have adopted stock ownership guidelines, provided for limited accelerated vesting of PSUs, stock options, and RSUs upon termination of employment, and provided for only double-trigger accelerated vesting of stock-based awards upon a change in control. The Compensation Committee reviewed the risk assessment and concluded that our compensation programs and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally places a $1 million limit on the amount of compensation a company can deduct in any one year for "covered employees". While the Compensation Committee seeks to preserve tax deductibility in developing and implementing our executive compensation program, the committee also believes that it is important to maintain flexibility in administering compensation programs in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals and the interests of our shareholders. Accordingly, we have not adopted a policy that all compensation must qualify as deductible for tax purposes and retain the ability to provide compensation that may not qualify as deductible under Section 162(m). COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K. Based on the review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

Effective June 1, 2023, the first day of fiscal 2024, Mr. Campion ceased serving as Chief Operating Officer and became NIKE's Managing Director, Strategic Business Ventures and Ms. O'Neill became NIKE's President, Consumer, Product & Brand. (2) For fiscal 2022, represents awards under our PSP, which were paid at 0% for Mr. Donahoe and 80% for Messrs. Friend and Campion and Ms. O'Neill; Mr. Parker did not receive a fiscal 2022 PSP award. For fiscal 2021, represents annual cash incentive awards which were paid at 120% of target to each executive officer, as well as transition-period cash incentive awards paid to Messrs. Donahoe and Parker. (3) Represents the grant date fair value of RSU and PSU awards granted in fiscal 2023 and 2022, and RSU awards granted in fiscal 2021, in each case computed in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to stock-based compensation. For RSUs, the grant date fair value was computed based on the closing market price of our Class B Stock on the grant date. For PSUs, the grant date fair value was computed using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. The assumptions made in determining the grant date fair value of PSUs under applicable accounting guidance are disclosed in footnote 5 of "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2023". For fiscal 2023, the grant date fair value of the PSU awards was: $10,250,484 for Mr. Donahoe; $2,595,059 for Messrs. Friend and Campion and Ms. O'Neill; and $0 for Mr. Parker. Assuming that the maximum level of performance conditions is achieved, the value of those PSU awards would be: $16,759,123 for Mr. Donahoe; $4,242,816 for Messrs. Friend and Campion and Ms. O'Neill; and $0 for Mr. Parker.

Under this plan, the Compensation Committee approved target awards for fiscal 2023 based on a percentage of the executive's base salary paid during fiscal 2023 as follows: Mr. Donahoe, 200%; Mr. Friend, 120%; Mr. Campion, 120%; Ms. O'Neill, 120%; and Mr. Parker, 0%. Fiscal 2023 PSP awards are earned between 0% and 150% of target based on Company performance on three equally-weighted metrics—Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Digital Revenue, and Adjusted EBIT—during fiscal 2023. Actual award payouts earned in fiscal 2023 and paid in fiscal 2024 are shown in the Summary Compensation Table. (2) These amounts represent grants of PSUs under the SIP which are earned between 0% and 200% of target based on Relative TSR for fiscal 2023 – 2025, subject to a cap of 100% of target if Absolute TSR for the performance period is negative. If Relative TSR is at or above the threshold performance goal, the Compensation Committee may adjust the earnout upwards or downwards by up to 20 percentage points based on a holistic assessment of the Company's performance during the three-year performance period with respect to employee engagement and inclusion, representation of diverse individuals in leadership positions, and sustainability. Earned PSUs will vest in August 2025 and are generally subject to continued employment through the vesting date. Vesting will be accelerated in certain circumstances as described below in the section "Potential Payouts Upon Termination or Change-in-Control". The PSUs accumulate cash dividend equivalents that are paid only when, and to the extent, they vest. (3) Amounts reported in this column represent grants of RSUs under the SIP which vest in three equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Vesting will be accelerated in certain circumstances as described below in the section "Potential Payouts Upon Termination or Change-in-Control". The RSUs accumulate cash dividend equivalents that are only paid upon vesting. (4) Amounts reported in this column represent stock options granted under the SIP which become exercisable in four equal installments on the first four anniversaries of the grant date. Options become exercisable in certain circumstances as described below in the section "Potential Payouts Upon Termination or Change-in-Control". Each option has a maximum term of 10 years, subject to earlier termination in the event of the optionee's termination of employment. (5) For stock awards, represents the grant date fair value of (a) RSUs based on the closing market price of our Class B Stock on the grant date and (b) PSUs based on a value of $139.82 per share computed using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. The Monte Carlo simulation was performed using the remaining performance period of 2.83 years and assuming an expected volatility of 34.97% and risk-free interest rate of 2.79%. The expected volatility was based on an analysis of the historical volatility of the Class B Stock on the grant date for 2.83 years. The risk-free interest rate corresponding with the remaining performance period was calculated using the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rates in effect on the grant date for a 2- and 3-year period. For option awards, represents the grant date fair value of stock options granted based on a value of $32.13 per share, calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions made in determining option values are disclosed in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2023. Stock and option award values were computed in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to stock-based compensation. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 46 OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT MAY 31, 2023 The following table sets forth information concerning outstanding stock options, PSUs, and RSUs held by the Named Executive Officers at May 31, 2023.

(2) Of the amounts reported in this column, the following amounts have been reported in the Summary Compensation Tables in this proxy statement or in prior year proxy statements: Mr. Donahoe, $63,695; Mr. Friend, $9,503; Mr. Campion, $2,445,433; Ms. O'Neill, $1,207,906; and Mr. Parker, $22,185,929. NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in our Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP"). Participants in the DCP may elect in advance to defer up to 75 percent of their annual base salary, and up to 100 percent of their bonus and long-term cash incentive payments. We may make annual profit sharing contributions to defined contribution retirement plans. The contributions are allocated among eligible employees based on a percentage of their total salary and bonus for the year. To the fullest extent permitted under Internal Revenue Code limitations, these contributions are made to employees' accounts under our qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan. Contributions based on salary and bonus in excess of the tax law limit ($305,000 for fiscal 2023) are made as NIKE contributions under the DCP. Amounts deferred under the DCP are credited to a participant's account under the DCP. Each participant may allocate his or her account among any combination of the investment options available under the DCP. Participants' accounts are adjusted to reflect the investment performance of the investment options selected by the participants. Participants can change the allocation of their account balances daily. The investment options available under the DCP consist of 18 mutual funds with a variety of investment objectives and five risk-based portfolios. The investment options had annual returns in fiscal 2023 ranging from -15.91% to 3.77%. Amounts credited to participants' accounts are invested by us in actual investments matching the investment options selected by the participants to ensure that we do not bear any investment risk related to participants' investment choices. The portion of a participant's account attributable to elective deferrals, including investment returns, is fully vested at all times. The portion of a participant's account attributable to NIKE contributions, including investment returns, is fully vested after the participant has been employed by us for five years. All of the Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Donahoe, are fully vested in their NIKE contributions. Each time they elect to defer compensation, participants make an election regarding distribution of the compensation deferred under the election (as adjusted to reflect investment performance). A participant may elect for distribution to be made in a lump sum at the beginning of a predetermined year while the participant is still employed or in service (but no sooner than the fourth year after the year in which the distribution election is submitted). Alternatively, a participant may elect for distribution to be made in a lump sum or in quarterly installments over five, ten, or fifteen years after termination of employment or service. Participants have limited rights to change their distribution elections. Participants may make a hardship withdrawal under certain circumstances. Subject to certain limitations, a participant may also at any time request to withdraw amounts from his or her account balance that were vested as of December 31, 2004 (and any subsequent investment returns on such amount). If such request is approved, the participant may withdraw 90% of the amount requested, and the remaining 10% will be permanently forfeited. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 50 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE-IN-CONTROL CHANGE-IN-CONTROL COMPENSATION — ACCELERATION OF EQUITY AWARDS All unvested stock option, RSU, and PSU awards are subject to accelerated vesting upon the occurrence of two events (a "double-trigger"): there is a "change-in-control"; and the Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated by us without "cause" or by the Named Executive Officer for "good reason", in each case between the change-in-control (or shareholder approval of the change-in-control, if earlier) and the second anniversary of the change-in-control. Stock options will be exercisable for four years following termination of employment, but not beyond each option's original 10-year term. PSUs will vest at 100% of target. Accelerated vesting of stock options, RSUs, and PSUs will also occur if we are acquired and the acquiring company does not assume the outstanding options, RSUs, or PSUs. For purposes of our stock awards, "change-in-control" is generally defined to include: • the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of our outstanding Class A Stock or, if the Class A Stock no longer elects a majority of directors, the acquisition by any person of 30% or more of our total outstanding Common Stock; • the nomination (and subsequent election) in a two-year period of a majority of our directors by persons other than the incumbent directors; • a sale of all or substantially all of our assets; and • an acquisition of NIKE through a merger, consolidation, or share exchange. For purposes of our stock awards, "cause" generally includes willful and continued failure to substantially perform assigned duties and willful engagement in illegal conduct materially injurious to us, and "good reason" generally includes a material diminution in position or duties, a salary reduction or material reduction in other benefits, and a home office relocation of over 50 miles. The following table shows the estimated benefits that would have been received by the Named Executive Officers if double-trigger accelerated vesting had occurred on May 31, 2023, when the closing price of our Class B Stock was $105.26 per share.

The amounts in the table above represent the number of unvested RSUs and PSUs (at 100% of target) multiplied by the closing price of our Class B Stock on May 31, 2023. (2) Information regarding outstanding unvested stock options held by each Named Executive Officer is set forth in the Outstanding Equity Awards table above. The amounts in the table above represent the aggregate value as of May 31, 2023 of those options using the excess of the per share closing price of our Class B Stock on May 31, 2023 over the per share exercise price, multiplied by the number of unvested option shares for each Named Executive Officer. BENEFITS TRIGGERED ON CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT TERMINATIONS STOCK OPTION ACCELERATION AND EXTENSION As of May 31, 2023, each Named Executive Officer held stock options as listed in the Outstanding Equity Awards table above. Under the terms of the stock options held by each Named Executive Officer, upon the death or disability of the holder, all unvested options will vest and will be exercisable for four years following termination of employment, but not beyond each option's original 10-year term. If death or disability of a Named Executive Officer had occurred on May 31, 2023, the aggregate value of those options is as set forth in the "Stock Option Acceleration" column of the Change-in-Control Compensation – Acceleration of Equity Awards table above. Under the terms of the stock options held by each Named Executive Officer that were granted after fiscal 2020, upon a termination of employment due to a "divestiture" or "reduction in force" that occurs at least six months following the grant date, and subject to the holder signing a general waiver and release of claims, options that are scheduled to vest within one year following the termination will vest and all vested options will be exercisable for one year following termination of employment, but not beyond each option's original 10-year term. The value of the unvested stock options held by each Named Executive Officer as of May 31, 2023 that would have become vested if a termination due to a "divestiture" or "reduction in force" had occurred on that date is $458,189 for Mr. Donahoe, $147,637 for each of Messrs. Friend and Campion and Ms. O'Neill, and $509,092 for Mr. Parker. 51 NIKE, INC. Under the terms of all the stock options held by the Named Executive Officers, options that have been outstanding for at least one year will be subject to continued vesting if the holder retires after reaching age 55 with at least 5 years of service (or accelerated vesting if the holder retires after reaching age 60 with at least 5 years of service), and vested options will be exercisable for four years following termination of employment, but not beyond each option's original 10-year term. If the Named Executive Officers had retired on May 31, 2023, the aggregate value of stock options subject to retirement vesting would have been $1,099,922 for Mr. Donahoe, $634,903 for Ms. O'Neill, and $2,691,237 for Mr. Parker. Messrs. Friend and Campion are not eligible for retirement vesting because these Named Executive Officers have not reached age 55. STOCK AWARD ACCELERATION As of May 31, 2023, the Named Executive Officers held unvested RSUs and PSUs as set forth in the Outstanding Equity Awards table above. Under the terms of their award agreements, all unvested RSUs and PSUs will immediately vest upon the death or disability of the holder, with PSUs vesting at 100% of target. The value of the unvested RSUs and PSUs held by each Named Executive Officer as of May 31, 2023 that would have become vested if death or disability had occurred on that date is as set forth in the "Stock Award Acceleration" column of the Change-in-Control Compensation — Acceleration of Equity Awards table above. Under the terms of the RSUs that were granted to the Named Executive Officers after fiscal 2020 (excluding the stock-based transition awards granted to Messrs. Friend and Campion and Ms. O'Neill) and all PSUs held by the Named Executive Officers, upon a termination of employment due to a "divestiture" or "reduction in force" that occurs at least six months following the grant date, and subject to the holder signing a general waiver and release of claims, RSUs and PSUs that are scheduled to vest within one year following the termination will vest, with PSUs vesting at 100% of target. The value of the unvested RSUs and PSUs held by each Named Executive Officer as of May 31, 2023 that would have become vested if a termination due to a "divestiture" or "reduction in force" had occurred on that date is $3,114,644 for Mr. Donahoe, $1,132,493 for Mr. Friend, $1,175,755 for each of Mr. Campion and Ms. O'Neill, and $0 for Mr. Parker. PAYMENTS UNDER NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENTS We have a noncompetition agreement with Mr. Donahoe that extends for 18 months following the termination of his employment with us and a noncompetition agreement with Mr. Parker that extends for two years following the termination of his employment with us. Under these agreements, if Mr. Donahoe's employment is terminated by us without "cause" (as defined in his agreement), or if Mr. Parker's employment is terminated by us, we will make monthly payments to the executive during the noncompetition period in an amount equal to one-twelfth of his then current annual salary and target PSP award ("Annual NIKE Income"). The agreements provide further that if the executive voluntarily resigns, we will make monthly payments to him during the noncompetition period in an amount equal to one-twenty-fourth of his then current Annual NIKE Income. However, commencement of the above-described monthly payments will be delayed until after the six-month period following the executive's separation from service, and all payments that he would otherwise have received during that period will be paid in a lump sum promptly following the end of the period, together with interest at the prime rate. If employment is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the applicable agreement), the parties may mutually agree to waive the covenant not to compete, and if employment is terminated for "cause", we may unilaterally waive the covenant. If the covenant is waived, we will not be required to make the payments described above for the months as to which the waiver applies. Assuming that Mr. Donahoe's employment had been terminated on May 31, 2023 and the covenant was not waived, during the 18-month period ending November 30, 2024 we would have been required to pay Mr. Donahoe $375,000 per month if the termination was by us without "cause", or $187,500 per month if he had voluntarily resigned. Assuming that Mr. Parker's employment had been terminated on May 31, 2023 and the covenant was not waived, during the 24-month period ending May 31, 2025 we would have been required to pay Mr. Parker $83,333 per month if the termination was by us, or $41,667 per month if he had voluntarily resigned. We have noncompetition agreements with each of the other Named Executive Officers on generally the same terms as Mr. Donahoe, except that the noncompetition period is one year, we may unilaterally waive the covenant in all cases (including a termination without "cause"), the monthly payments are one-twelfth or one-twenty-fourth of the executive's then current annual salary (instead of their Annual NIKE Income), and payments may commence on termination. Assuming that the employment of each of these Named Executive Officers had been terminated on May 31, 2023 and the covenant was not waived, during the 12-month period ending May 31, 2024 we would have been required to pay them $104,167 per month if the termination was by us without "cause", or $52,083 per month if they had voluntarily resigned. CEO PAY RATIO NIKE's pay and benefits are designed to be competitive and equitable, meet the diverse needs of our global teammates, and reinforce our values. We pay for performance and impact by linking incentive pay to Company performance and seek to invest in positive experiences that have the greatest impact on the engagement and well-being of our employees. The executive compensation program is highly incentive-based and weighted towards long-term awards to emphasize long-term performance 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 52 and support retention. Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain top-tier talent in a competitive market and to "pay for performance" in order to drive business results and maximize shareholder value. For fiscal 2023, our last completed fiscal year: • The employee identified at the median of all NIKE employees (other than our CEO) was a retail store employee in Canada; • The annual total compensation of the median employee was $33,646; • The annual total compensation of our CEO, Mr. Donahoe, was $32,789,885; and • The estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median annual total compensation of all other NIKE employees was 975 to 1. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on the methodology described below. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, apply certain exclusions, and make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. METHODOLOGY For purposes of calculating this pay ratio, we used the same median employee that was identified in fiscal 2022, as we believe there has been no change in our employee population, our compensation arrangements, or our median employee's circumstances that would significantly affect our pay ratio disclosure. The determination of the median employee was made in fiscal 2022 using the methodology described below, and the median employee's fiscal 2023 annual total compensation was calculated based on the Summary Compensation Table rules used for our Named Executive Officers (in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K). FISCAL 2022 METHODOLOGY We use the first business day in May as the date to determine the median employee. The first business day in May for fiscal 2022 was May 2, 2022. At that time, we had approximately 77,239 employees globally. After applying the "de minimis exemption" under the SEC rules, which permits us to exclude non-U.S. employees accounting for 5% or less of our total employee population, we excluded the 3,656 employees in the jurisdictions identified below, and our employee population consisted of approximately 73,583 employees. Slovenia 1 Denmark 68 Malaysia 206 Sri Lanka 4 Uruguay 71 Thailand 206 United Arab Emirates 5 Czech Republic 73 South Africa 207 Croatia 6 Hungary 82 Vietnam 252 Philippines 19 Indonesia 85 Israel 266 Macau 42 Ireland 87 Poland 276 New Zealand 44 Switzerland 113 Chile 285 Norway 45 Greece 135 Hong Kong 323 Sweden 55 Portugal 148 Turkey 340 Brazil 61 Austria 151 Of the 73,583 employees included in the CEO Pay Ratio calculation, approximately 75% were full-time, 49% were in retail jobs, and 51% were located in the United States. To identify our median employee we calculated annual compensation for fiscal 2022 based on base salary or hourly wages, as applicable. For the majority of our employees, base salary or hourly wages comprise the majority of their compensation. To determine wages for hourly employees, we used each individual's pay rate and estimated scheduled hours in the applicable Human Resources system of record. After determining the annual compensation for our employee population as described above, we identified a subset of approximately 100 individuals representing the potential median employee population. For this subset, we calculated each employee's annual total compensation in U.S. dollars for fiscal 2022 based on the Summary Compensation Table rules used for our Named Executive Officers (in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K). Compensation for permanent employees hired during the fiscal year was annualized, compensation for non-U.S. employees was converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable currency conversion rate as reported in the Human Resources system of record for the median employee determination date, and the median employee was then selected from this subset. 53 NIKE, INC.

We determined Adjusted Revenue to be the most important financial performance measure used to link Company performance to compensation actually paid ("CAP") to our CEO and non-CEO NEOs in fiscal 2023, as required pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K. This performance measure may not have been the most important financial performance measure for prior fiscal years, and we may determine a different financial performance measure to be the most important financial performance measure in future years. DESCRIPTION OF RELATIONSHIPS The following charts show graphically the relationships over the past three fiscal years of the CAP amounts for our CEO and non-CEO NEOs as compared to our cumulative TSR, peer group TSR, GAAP net income, and Adjusted Revenue as well as the relationship between TSR and peer group TSR.

Adjusted Revenue Adjusted EBIT Stock price . 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 56 PROPOSAL 3 FREQUENCY OF ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are submitting to shareholders an advisory vote on whether to present our advisory "say-on-pay proposal" to shareholders every one year, every two years, or every three years. Under Exchange Act rules, we are required to present this "say-on-pay vote frequency proposal" at least once every six years. When shareholders last voted on a say-on-pay vote frequency proposal, at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Board recommended holding a say-on-pay vote annually, and approximately 94% of the votes cast were voted in favor of holding such a vote annually. The Board continues to value shareholder feedback on our executive compensation program, and believes that an annual say-on-pay vote offers a strong mechanism for all shareholders to provide timely input on the Company's executive compensation practices and policies. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board. However, the Board values shareholder opinions, and will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering the frequency of future say-on-pay votes. BOARD RECOMMENDATION The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote for future shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation to be held every 1 YEAR . 57 NIKE, INC. AUDIT MATTERS PROPOSAL 4 RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors has sole authority to retain, with shareholder ratification, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit & Finance Committee directly oversees the firm's work with respect to the annual audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and approves all audit engagement fees and terms. At least annually, the Audit & Finance Committee evaluates the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, performance, and independence, including a review and evaluation of its lead partner. The Audit & Finance Committee is also involved in the selection of the new lead engagement partner following mandated rotation of the firm’s lead partner, and is responsible for considering the benefits of rotation of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit & Finance Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024 and to render other professional services as required. PwC has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for many years. The Audit & Finance Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the continued retention of PwC as the independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Audit & Finance Committee is submitting the appointment of PwC to shareholders for ratification. If the appointment is not ratified by our shareholders, the Audit & Finance Committee may reconsider whether it should appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. Representatives of PwC will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to questions. Aggregate fees billed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, PwC, for audit services related to the most recent two fiscal years, and for other professional services incurred in the most recent two fiscal years, were as follows: TYPE OF SERVICE 2023 2022 Audit Fees (1) $18.7 million $18.1 million Audit-Related Fees (2) 0.3 million 0.3 million Tax Fees (3) 0.2 million 0.1 million All Other Fees (4) 0.8 million 0.8 million Total $20.0 million $19.3 million (1) Comprises the audits of the Company's annual financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting, and reviews of the Company's quarterly financial statements, as well as statutory audits of Company subsidiaries, attest services and consents to SEC filings. (2) Comprises services including consultations regarding financial accounting and reporting. (3) Comprises services for tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice. Tax compliance includes services for compliance related tax advice, as well as the preparation and review of both original and amended tax returns for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Tax compliance related fees represented $0.1 million of the tax fees for fiscal 2023 and $0.1 million of the tax fees for fiscal 2022. The remaining tax fees primarily include tax advice. (4) Comprises other miscellaneous services. In accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Audit & Finance Committee established policies and procedures under which all audit and non-audit services performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm must be approved in advance by the Audit & Finance Committee. During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, all such services performed by, and fees paid to, PwC were approved in advance. BOARD RECOMMENDATION The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote FOR ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 58 REPORT OF THE AUDIT & FINANCE COMMITTEE The Audit & Finance Committee has: • Reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management. • Discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and the SEC. • Received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountants required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountants' communications concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence. • Based on the review and discussions above, recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the last fiscal year for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Members of the Audit & Finance Committee: • Alan Graf, Jr., Chair • Maria Henry • Peter Henry • Robert Swan 59 NIKE, INC. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS PROPOSAL 5 TO CONSIDER A SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING SUPPLEMENTAL PAY EQUITY DISCLOSURE The following shareholder proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent. Mary McInnes, c/o Arjuna Capital, 13 Elm Street, Manchester, MA 01944, a beneficial owner of at least $25,000 of Class B Stock, submitted the Proposal together with co-filer Change Finance, P.B.C. The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal and asks shareholders to read through NIKE's response which follows the shareholder proposal. Racial and Gender Pay Gaps Whereas: Pay inequities persist across race and gender and pose substantial risk to companies and society at large. Black workers’ hourly median earnings represent 81 percent of white wages. The median income for women working full time is 83 percent that of men. Intersecting race, Black women earn 64 cents, Native women 51 cents, and Latina women 54 cents. At the current rate, women will not reach pay equity until 2059, Black women until 2130, and Latina women until 2224. Citigroup estimates closing minority and gender wage gaps 20 years ago could have generated 12 trillion dollars in additional income. PwC estimates closing the gender pay gap could boost Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries’ economies by 2 trillion dollars annually. Actively managing pay equity is associated with improved representation, and diversity is linked to superior stock performance and return on equity. Minorities represent 60 percent of Nike's workforce, but only 30 percent of leadership. Women represent 49 percent of Nike's workforce and 43 percent of leadership. Best practice pay equity reporting consists of two parts: 1. unadjusted median pay gaps, assessing equal opportunity to high paying roles, 2. statistically adjusted gaps, assessing pay between minorities and non-minorities, men and women, performing similar roles. Nike reports only statistically adjusted gaps but ignores unadjusted gaps, which address structural bias women and minorities face regarding job opportunity and pay, particularly when men hold most higher paying jobs. Median pay gaps show, quite literally, how Nike assigns value to employees through the roles they inhabit and pay they receive. Median gap reporting also provides a digestible and comparable data point to determine progress over time. Racial and gender median pay gaps are accepted as the valid way of measuring pay inequity by the United States Census Bureau, Department of Labor, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and International Labor Organization. The United Kingdom and Ireland mandate disclosure of median gender pay gaps. Nike discloses data for United Kingdom employees, reporting a median hourly gender pay gap of 7 percent and median bonus gap of 33 percent. Resolved: Shareholders request Nike report on median pay gaps across race and gender, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining diverse talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information. Racial/gender pay gaps are defined as the difference between non-minority and minority/male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of non-minority/male earnings (Wikipedia/OECD, respectively). Supporting Statement: An annual report adequate for investors to assess performance could, with board discretion, integrate base, bonus and equity compensation to calculate: • percentage median gender pay gap, globally and/or by country, where appropriate • percentage median racial/minority/ethnicity pay gap, US and/or by country, where appropriate 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 60 OPPOSITION STATEMENT The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal because: • We remain committed to the principle of equal pay for equal work and to enhancing the representation of diverse individuals at all levels of the Company; and • Our current initiatives and public disclosures, including the pay equity data published in our annual Impact Report, already address the underlying rationale for the proposal and provide our shareholders with more relevant information about NIKE's commitment to pay equity and increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DE&I") at all levels of the Company than the requested measure. We remain committed to maintaining pay equity, increasing diversity at all levels of the Company, and providing transparency. As demonstrated by the 2025 People targets set forth in NIKE's annual Impact Report, NIKE is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture by focusing on representation, education, development, and community. We believe that diversity is a key component of innovation and strive to build a creative and inclusive environment, where all voices are welcomed and heard. Our pay equity ratio, which is disclosed annually in our Impact Report, reflects our commitment to deliver equal pay for equal work. NIKE defines pay equity as equal compensation for employees across gender, race, and ethnicity, who undertake the same work at the same career level, location, experience, and performance. We have achieved and maintained a global pay equity ratio of 1:1 for men to women and a 1:1 pay equity ratio for white employees to racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. We regularly monitor internal pay infrastructure and annually review our compensation and promotion practices across all geographies, functions, and business units with the goal of ensuring we continue to achieve pay equity every year. During fiscal 2022, we also enhanced our commitment to educate employees on talent and pay practices by expanding our resources and hosting live training sessions with the goal of strengthening manager capability and confidence in having productive pay conversations. In addition to our commitment to maintaining pay equity, we are also focused on increasing gender and racial diversity throughout the Company, including among our leadership ranks. In our annual Impact Report we disclose the actual percentage representation of women globally and racial and ethnic minorities in the United States and its trend over time to enable our shareholders to track the progress that we have made in advancing diversity in our workforce generally as well as specifically in senior leadership roles. We have also committed to specific 2025 targets related to pay equity as well as DE&I at the Company. For example, we have adopted specific representation-related targets, including achieving 50% representation of women in the global corporate workforce, 45% representation of women globally at the VP level, 35% representation of racial and ethnic minorities in our U.S. workforce, and 30% representation of racial and ethnic minorities at the Director level and above in the United States. We have already achieved many of these targets. As of fiscal 2022, women make up 51% of our global corporate workforce and racial and ethnic minorities make up 39% of our workforce in the United States and we have increased VP-level representation for women globally to 44% (a 17 percentage point increase from 2015) and for racial and ethnic minorities in the United States to 35% (a 19 percentage point increase from 2015). NIKE also discloses its Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1 Data, although we do not use the EEO-1 Data to measure progress or believe it is appropriate to do so. The EEO-1 Data for 2021 is available on the Company’s website. And at the Board level, NIKE has adopted a set of qualification standards for director nominees, which includes, among other things, diversity and inclusion as a factor. We maintain robust policies and programs to advance our diversity, equity, and inclusion goals throughout the Company by ensuring a diverse breadth of talent in our pipeline and developing and supporting our female and U.S. racial and ethnic minority employees. Although we have made good progress with respect to DE&I, we know there is more work to be done. We have continued to expand our programming to recruit, develop, promote, and retain diverse employees. We have scaled up our efforts to recruit the best and the brightest talent through traditional executive and campus recruiting channels and by expanding and deepening our relationships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities ("HBCUs") and Hispanic-Serving Institutions ("HSIs"). We have also launched innovative programs, such as the Serena Design Crew, an eight-month apprenticeship program designed to bring diverse, talented individuals together to work on a Serena inspired collection, and Women in Nike ("WIN"), a two-year program to provide relevant and dynamic work experience for retired or retiring WNBA players. 61 NIKE, INC. Specific highlights of our recent efforts to enhance the recruitment, development, and retention of diverse talent at all levels of the Company include: • Increasing our focus on diversity recruitment programs, including by expanding and deepening our relationships with HBCUs and HSIs through year-round engagement, workshops, and a commitment to a $10 million investment in HBCUs and HSIs by 2025. • Innovative programs aimed at building a pipeline of exceptional and diverse candidates, such as our Serena Design Crew apprenticeship for diverse and talented individuals and our WIN initiative for retired or retiring WNBA players. • Strategies to attract and select diverse candidates for our intern program through inclusive intern hiring and full-time employee conversion. • Eight employee-formed and managed networks that help build community for a diverse spectrum of individuals across the Company, such as the Black Employee Network and Friends, Latino & Friends Network, Native American Network & Friends, PRIDE Network and Women of Nike & Friends. • A new Inclusive Leadership education certification within our ongoing VP leadership program for all NIKE executives across the globe. • A custom unconscious bias awareness training was developed and rolled out to all employees in fiscal 2023. • Our Board’s ongoing oversight of the Company’s DE&I policies as well as the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee's regular review and evaluation of significant DE&I strategies, activities, policies, investments, and programs. • Benefits that are responsive to our employees’ diverse needs, including transgender healthcare coverage and fertility, adoption, and surrogacy benefits. At NIKE, DE&I is integrated into the entire Talent agenda from the very beginning of the employee experience, with measurement and leadership accountability throughout each employee's career. Finally, NIKE supports our recruitment, development, promotion, and retention efforts through investments in DE&I education for all employees, to ensure that our people have the awareness and understanding necessary to build and retain diverse and inclusive teams; to empower and enable employees to grow their careers at NIKE through professional development programs and experiences; and to ensure an ecosystem of belonging and access for our internal communities through our eight employee networks. Our long-standing commitment to and support of gender and racial equality has been affirmed by many organizations. For example, NIKE has earned the title of Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ employees for the 20th year in a row, with a perfect score on the 2022 Corporate Equality Index, and Forbes named NIKE as one of the Best Employers for Diversity in 2023. More information about our key initiatives and diversity metrics is available in the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion section of our website and in our FY22 NIKE, Inc. Impact Report, both of which are available through the Impact section of our website. As described above, we continue to provide information about our pay infrastructure, pay equity, and the representation of women and racial and ethnic minority employees in senior leadership positions on our website and in our annual Impact Report. We believe that a commitment to transparency helps to build trust with our shareholders and internal and external stakeholders and holds us accountable to our commitments, which is why we continue to provide such information to our shareholders. In contrast, the median pay gap measure seeks to compare the pay of two employees whose compensation happens to fall at the midpoint of the pay range among those employees sharing the relevant gender, racial, or ethnic characteristic, without adjusting for relevant factors that can explain differences in pay, such as their different role, skills, performance, experience, tenure, or location. Although the proposal is aimed at providing transparency with respect to pay equity and equal opportunity, this statistic does not demonstrate whether our women and racial and ethnic minority employees are being paid fairly for the roles that they are doing nor does it accurately depict female or racial and ethnic representation at NIKE’s different locations around the globe. Our shareholders would not benefit from a surrogate measurement of pay equity that ultimately does not provide any meaningful supplemental information to our existing disclosures. Our shareholders seem to agree since a similar proposal received from the proponent in 2021 received the support of only approximately 18% of votes cast. In summary, the Board of Directors believes the proposal is unnecessary because NIKE already publicly discloses information with respect to our DE&I initiatives, pay equity, and diversity metrics and provides our shareholders with meaningful insight into our progress in this area that more effectively responds to the underlying objective of the proposal than the unadjusted median pay gap disclosure requested by the proposal would. BOARD RECOMMENDATION X The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 62 PROPOSAL 6 TO CONSIDER A SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING A SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT REPORT The following shareholder proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent. Tulipshare Ltd., 64 Nile Street, International House, London, England, N1 7SR UK, a beneficial owner of at least $25,000 of Class B Stock, submitted the Proposal. The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal and asks shareholders to read through NIKE's response which follows the shareholder proposal. RESOLVED: Shareholders of Nike, Inc. ("Nike") request that the Board oversee and issue a report to shareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, assessing the effectiveness of its existing supply chain management infrastructure in ensuring alignment with Nike's equity goals and human rights commitments. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: In the Board’s discretion we recommend Nike's report include: • Assessment of whether existing policies and implementation mechanisms, such as codes, guidance and supply chain contract terms ensure alignment throughout the value chain; • Methodology and metrics to track and measure performance on forced labor and wage theft risks; • Consistency with OECD Guidelines, UN Guiding Principles, and Sustainable Development Goals; • Consideration of American Bar Association (ABA) Model Contract Clauses on human rights in the supply chain; and • Whether the assessment yields any changes to Company policies, decision making, and implementation mechanisms. WHEREAS: In the apparel industry, forced labor occurs both in the production of raw materials and during manufacturing, especially at lower tier suppliers. An estimated 27.6 million people are trapped in forced labor, with annual increases in forced labor driven entirely by the private economy. 1 UN Guiding Principles require corporate responsibility to respect human rights within operations and supply chains. Shareholders agree Nike should expand "opportunity for women" 2 considering a majority of Nike's garment workers are women 3 and the exacerbated human rights violations during the pandemic. 4 Nike's impact report includes continued support for the UN Global Compact. 5 However, Nike's communication on progress only meets six of seventeen Sustainable Development Goals. 6 Nike has not disclosed adequate analysis regarding the efficacy of traceability steps taken to address the risks of alleged Uyghur forced labor across its supply chain tiers, nor does Nike disclose engagement with affected rightsholders or whether remedies are satisfactory to victims; KnowTheChain identified Nike policies in need of improvement: purchasing practices, worker voice, and remedy. 7 In 2022, the EU adopted a Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence in global value chains, requiring companies like Nike to identify, prevent, end or mitigate adverse impacts on human rights. 8 This Directive sets obligations, penalties and liability for large companies, with respect to their own operations, subsidiaries, and business partners. 9 In 2023, garment-worker unions and labor-rights groups filed a complaint alleging Nike's treatment of workers and unpaid wages violated OECD guidelines. 10 Nike allegedly owes an estimated $1.4 million in unpaid wages to Cambodian garment workers, 11 with Nike's overall wage theft from workers alleged at $28 million. 12 One possible approach for Nike to fulfil its responsibility to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts in its supply chain is deployment of the ABA's Model Contract Clauses. The contract clauses are aimed at ensuring responsible purchasing practices, such as reasonable assistance to suppliers, responsible exit, and victim remedies. 13 1 https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_854733.pdf 2 https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/statements/a-letter-from-our-president-and-ceo 3 https://manufacturingmap.nikeinc.com/ 4 https://www.payyourworkers.org/ramatex 5 https://purpose-cms-preprod01.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/17210319/FY21_NIKE-Impact-Report.pdf 6 https://unglobalcompact.org/participation/report/cop/active/464879 7 https://knowthechain.org/company/nike_2021/#resources 8 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1145 9 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/01/council-adopts-position-on-due-diligence-rules-for-large-companies/ 10 https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/worker-rights-nike-oecd-complaint-covid-19-pandemic-wage-theft/; https://globallaborjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/OECD-Fact-Sheet-Nike.pdf 11 https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/cambodia-trade-unions-demand-nike-matalan-pay-garment-workers-from-closed-factory-14-million-in-unpaid-compensation-damages/ 12 https://asia.floorwage.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Money-Heist_Book_Final-compressed.pdf 13 https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/human_rights/contractual-clauses-project/mccs-full-report.pdf 63 NIKE, INC. OPPOSITION STATEMENT The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal because: • NIKE strongly believes in, and is committed to respecting, human and labor rights throughout our operations and supply chain; • NIKE's commitment to ethical practices in our own operations and our supply chain begins at the highest level; • NIKE expects, and supports the creation of, world-class, safe, and healthy workplaces for the people making our products; • NIKE continues to evolve and strengthen our expectations and practices; and • NIKE's policies effectively articulate our long-standing commitment to human rights and sustainable sourcing, rendering the proposal unnecessary. NIKE strongly believes in, and is committed to respecting, human and labor rights throughout our operations and supply chain. NIKE is deeply committed to ethical and responsible manufacturing and to the goal that all people who make and move NIKE products are respected and valued. To inform our expectations of third-party manufacturers and suppliers, we look to the human rights defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s ("ILO") Declaration on Fundamental Rights at Work and consider the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises as best practices for understanding and managing human rights risks and impacts. Using these standards, we have developed a Supplier Code of Conduct ("Supplier Code of Conduct") and Code Leadership Standards ("CLS"), which are publicly available on our website and translated into 15 languages, and which set strong expectations for the contract manufacturers that manufacture our finished products ("suppliers"), as well as procedures for measuring compliance with such expectations. The Supplier Code of Conduct lays out minimum standards NIKE expects each supplier to meet in producing NIKE products and includes strict requirements regarding forced and child labor, excessive overtime, compensation, and freedom of association, among other requirements. The CLS articulates how NIKE measures suppliers' compliance efforts and progress against our Supplier Code of Conduct, including specific requirements on the management of key forced labor risks. NIKE also explicitly requires our suppliers to comply with all local and country-specific labor laws as well as the CLS and our Supplier Code of Conduct. NIKE has progressively raised expectations for our suppliers through evolving the standards within the Supplier Code of Conduct and CLS. Recent updates include broadening the definitions of employment fees to be borne by suppliers and strengthening the oversight requirements for labor agents recruiting and hiring foreign migrant workers. We monitor compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct and CLS through regular internal and external third-party audits, both announced and unannounced, to track the environmental and social performance of our contract manufacturers against those expectations. In the event of alleged noncompliance, we investigate and, if improvements are required, we take a collaborative approach to working with suppliers to verify corrective actions are taken, problems are remediated, and managers have onsite verification. Should a supplier fail to remediate issues identified by an audit, it is subject to review and sanctions, including potential termination of the supplier relationship. NIKE works to elevate human potential through our products, third party relationships, and operations, something that cannot be accomplished without a fundamental respect for human rights throughout NIKE's operations. NIKE expects the same from our suppliers, and we focus on working with long-term, strategic suppliers that demonstrate a commitment to engaging their workers, providing safe working conditions, and advancing environmental responsibility. This includes working to combat risks of forced labor. NIKE discloses all of the independent contract manufacturers and the majority of material vendors used to manufacture NIKE products in an interactive and publicly available NIKE Manufacturing Map. NIKE also requires our suppliers to source materials from vendors that are compliant with NIKE's Supplier Code of Conduct, Traceability Standards, and Restricted Substances List. NIKE's commitment to ethical practices in our own operations and our supply chain begins at the highest level. The Board's Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee reviews and evaluates the Company's significant strategies, activities, policies, investments, and programs regarding corporate purpose, including corporate responsibility, sustainability, human rights, and global community and social impact, and provides oversight of management’s efforts to ensure that the Company's dedication to sustainability (including environmental sustainability and human rights) is reflected in our business operations. NIKE's Responsible Supply Chain team manages the day-to-day human rights and environmental impacts and risks across the global supply chain, and drives appropriate strategies to fuel a transparent and responsible supply chain that enables NIKE's growth, builds resilience, and protects the future of sport. NIKE works closely with suppliers, industry associations, brands, civil society, and other stakeholders to build world-class, safe, and healthy workplaces for the people making our products. NIKE believes that addressing complex and critical human rights risks, like forced labor, requires multi-stakeholder collaboration. We continually evaluate and update our systems to identify and address risks in the supply chain, including those related to forced labor. Where we identify potential adverse human rights impacts related to supply chain workers, we take steps to prevent and mitigate such impacts by leveraging our business relationships and collaborating with suppliers, stakeholders, and other brands. NIKE is a founding signatory to the American Apparel and Footwear Association and Fair Labor Association’s Apparel & Footwear Industry Commitment to Responsible Recruitment. The principles of the Commitment, centered on addressing risks for forced labor, are aligned with NIKE's standards and the work we have been doing for more than a decade with the contract factories that manufacture our products. We believe this builds on the multi-sector focus to drive change in the dynamics of how workers are recruited, including for crossborder employment. NIKE is also a member of the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, an initiative of the Institute for Human Rights and Business, and is a member of the Responsible Labor Initiative, an initiative of the Responsible Business Alliance, to further the Company’s work and goals on eliminating forced labor risks in our supply chain. Each organization helps NIKE to advance core aspects of our strategy. 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 64 A few of our fiscal 2022 highlights relating to our efforts to promote human and labor rights throughout our supply chain include: • Expanding our use of the CUMULUS Forced Labor ScreenTM (a due diligence tool to help identify risks related to the recruitment of foreign migrant workers by NIKE suppliers) to all Tier 1 finished goods and strategic Tier 2 suppliers hiring foreign migrant workers in our extended supply chain. • Collaborating with the Fair Labor Association and ILO's Better Work Programme to support the delivery of Better Work's trainings to workers at several suppliers in Jordan, focused on topics like mental well-being, sexual harassment prevention, and workplace communication. • Expanding our collaboration with the Issarra Institute by launching their Foreign Migrant Workers assessment survey in a factory in Thailand to assess gaps in the foreign migrant worker recruitment process, implementation of the Employer Pays Principle (prohibiting workers from paying fees for their employment), and working conditions. NIKE continues to collaborate with industry experts, suppliers, industry associations, stakeholders, and other organizations to understand, evaluate and address matters related to forced labor. NIKE also continues to expand and evolve our work with other industry peers, NGOs, and organizations on issues of human rights in the countries where the Company and our suppliers operate. NIKE continues to evolve and strengthen our expectations and practices. NIKE continues to refine our approach to supplier sustainability. We continue to adopt new strategies so our suppliers understand how to grow with NIKE's business in a sustainable and safe way. We develop five-year targets to enhance NIKE's sustainable sourcing practices, which are disclosed to shareholders in our annual Impact Report. Historically we have set an ambitious target of sourcing 100% from facilities that meet our foundational labor, health, safety, and environmental standards, focusing on finished goods manufacturing partners that we contract with directly. For our 2025 targets, we expanded the scope of this target to include key material suppliers (supplying approximately 90% of our footwear uppers and apparel materials) and focus distribution centers (representing at least 80% of volume), as well as NIKE owned or operated manufacturing facilities. In addition, in fiscal year 2021, we updated our Supplier Code of Conduct to better reflect our priorities across labor, health and safety, and the environment, drive consistency across the NIKE supply chain and progress toward our 2025 targets. As part of these changes, we added a new requirement for suppliers to develop and share their own internal Code of Conduct. This supports suppliers in fully integrating our expectations into their own business practices and compliance policies. We also strengthened expectations on identifying and addressing forced labor and child labor by elevating key risks of forced labor beyond recruitment fees to include freedom of movement, debt bondage, and building sufficient systems to manage employment relationship of vulnerable worker groups like foreign workers. We clarified examples of hazardous work to align with the minimum working age and elevated requirements around nonretaliation or interference/intimidation to prevent right to freely associate. As always, we plan to support our suppliers as we work together to meet our aggressive targets and implement the changes in our Supplier Code of Conduct. We have transitioned to common industry assessments on environment, labor, and health and safety to reduce duplication and audit fatigue for suppliers working with multiple brands, and to ensure that we work with others in the industry to drive impact with a unified voice. We have also enhanced supplier access to training and capacity building to improve management systems, adopt technical improvements in environmental, labor, and health and safety standards, and to sustain those improvements. NIKE is committed to sharing with our stakeholders how we manage social and environmental issues and impacts. At NIKE, we set open goals and implement transparent policies to promote human and labor rights and the ethical production of our products, while sharing our progress and learnings along the way. Each year's annual Impact Report highlights our progress towards our five-year targets and describes the work undertaken to support that progress. The Responsible Sourcing page of our website goes into further detail and includes our Supplier Code of Conduct and our CLS, which, as described above, specifies how contract manufacturers should implement the Supplier Code of Conduct and articulates how we measure supplier compliance efforts and progress against our Supplier Code of Conduct, including specific requirements on the management of key forced labor risks. Finally, we have published our Statement on Forced Labor, Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery for Fiscal Year 2022 on our website. The statement describes NIKE's commitment to ethical and responsible manufacturing, our ongoing supplier diligence and monitoring to identify and assess potential forced labor risks, how we engage with suppliers to prioritize the well-being of their workers, and our partnerships with various organizations to drive collaborative efforts to address critical human rights risks, such as forced labor. In summary, NIKE continues to work tirelessly to integrate respect for people and the planet throughout NIKE's entire business, including our supply chain, and to disclose our initiatives and policies so our shareholders have meaningful insight into our progress in this area. We believe that our decades of commitment to these issues have led to effective and impactful solutions. The Board of Directors believes that the Company's policies effectively articulate our long-standing support for, and continued commitment to, human rights and sustainable sourcing, rendering the proposal ineffective and unnecessary. BOARD RECOMMENDATION X The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 65 NIKE, INC. STOCK OWNERSHIP INFORMATION STOCK HOLDINGS OF CERTAIN OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT The following table sets forth the number of shares of the classes of NIKE securities beneficially owned, as of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to any transactions that occurred on such date, by (1) each person known to the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of the Company's securities, (2) each of the directors and nominees for director, (3) each executive officer listed in the Summary Compensation Table ("Named Executive Officers"), and (4) all directors, Named Executive Officers, and other executive officers as a group. Because Class A Stock is convertible into Class B Stock on a share-for-share basis, each beneficial owner of Class A Stock is deemed by the SEC to be a beneficial owner of the same number of shares of Class B Stock. Therefore, in indicating a person's beneficial ownership of shares of Class B Stock in the table, it has been assumed that such person has converted into Class B Stock all shares of Class A Stock of which such person is a beneficial owner. For these reasons the table contains substantial duplications in the numbers of shares and percentages of Class A and Class B Stock shown for Swoosh, LLC, Philip Knight, and the Travis A.

DELINQUENT SECTION 16(a) REPORTS Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and holders of more than 10 percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file with the SEC reports regarding their ownership and changes in ownership of Common Stock and other equity securities of the Company. Directors, officers, and greater than 10 percent shareholders are required by the regulations of the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on a review of such reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other reports were required, during fiscal 2023, we believe that all such reports that were required to be filed under Section 16(a) were timely filed, except that an amended Form 3 was filed for Robert Swan on June 22, 2023 to report certain indirect holdings that were inadvertently omitted from his initial, timely Form 3. 67 NIKE, INC. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS Philip Knight, the father of NIKE director Travis Knight, serves as Chairman Emeritus, which provides a standing invitation for Philip Knight to attend meetings of the Board and its committees as a non-voting observer. In fiscal 2023, as Chairman Emeritus, Mr. Knight received an annual salary of $500,000, and medical and dental insurance coverage generally available to employees. John Donahoe II and the Company have entered into time sharing agreements under which Mr. Donahoe reimburses the Company for limited personal use of Company aircraft, which is intended to increase his security, availability, and productivity. In fiscal 2023, Mr. Donahoe reimbursed the Company approximately $395,000 under the time sharing agreements.

If you received only the Notice, you may vote your shares at the website address listed on the Notice or by telephone. If you plan to vote during the Annual Meeting rather than in advance, you may do so by entering the 16-digit control number included in your Notice, voting instructions form, or proxy card. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, you are encouraged to vote by proxy prior to the meeting. You can always change your vote, as described in more detail under "Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy?" What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner or street name holder? If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered the "shareholder of record" with respect to those shares and we have sent the Notice (or if you received printed proxy materials, the Notice, proxy statement, and proxy card) directly to you. You may submit a proxy and vote those shares in the manner described in this proxy statement and the Notice. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, broker or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in street name. The Notice, voting instructions form, and/or proxy card have been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, or other holder of record who is considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, or other holder of record on how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction card included in the mailing or by following their instructions for voting. What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card or Notice? If you receive more than one proxy card or Notice, it means that you hold shares registered in more than one account. To ensure that all of your shares are voted, please follow the instructions included on each Notice you receive or, if you received printed proxy materials by mail, complete, sign, and return each proxy card you receive. How many shares may be voted at the Annual Meeting? On the close of business on July 12, 2023, 304,897,252 shares of Class A Stock and 1,225,074,356 shares of Class B Stock were issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting. What constitutes a quorum? For Proposal 1, the election of directors, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by each of the Class A Stock and Class B Stock separately constitutes a quorum of Class A Stock and Class B Stock, respectively. For Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by both of the Class A Stock and Class B Stock together constitutes a quorum Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Broker non-votes occur when a person holding shares in street name, such as through a brokerage firm, does not provide instructions as to how to vote those shares and the broker does not then vote those shares on the shareholder's behalf. How are votes calculated? Each share of Class A Stock and each share of Class B Stock is entitled to one vote. The holders of our Common Stock will vote together on all matters at the Annual Meeting except for the election of directors, for which the holders of Class A Stock and holders of Class B Stock will vote separately. For more information regarding our Class A Stock and Class B Stock, see the section above titled "Corporate Governance—Capital Structure". 2023 PROXY STATEMENT 70 How many votes are required to approve each proposal and how are votes counted?
