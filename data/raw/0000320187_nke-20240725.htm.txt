Similarly, we know that growth is enabled by strong corporate governance. That is why the Board of Directors is committed to effective and independent oversight, transparency, and continuous improvement—because in business and in sport, there is no finish line. Fiscal 2024 saw our Board membership continue to evolve. As part of our evergreen approach to Board refreshment, we are continually assessing Board composition to ensure that we maintain the right mix of experiences, attributes, and skills to effectively oversee and guide Nike. At the beginning of the fiscal year, Maria Henry joined the Board as an independent director, complementing and enhancing the Board with her strong experience, including across finance, global business, and governance. And at the end of the fiscal year, Alan Graf, Jr., announced that he will not be standing for re-election this year. We have deeply valued Alan's many contributions to the Board over more than 20 years of service, including his unique insights and perspective and his leadership, most recently as Chair of the Audit & Finance Committee. We will miss him, but know that we remain well-positioned to oversee Nike's next steps thanks to our evergreen refreshment process. As we look ahead to those next steps, Nike continues to engage with shareholders. The Board deeply values shareholder feedback and incorporates that feedback into our discussions and decision making. And we are pleased that, during fiscal 2024 engagements, shareholders recognized and responded positively to our responsiveness to feedback on governance, while continuing the dialogue. We are pleased to invite you to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of NIKE, Inc. to be held virtually on Tuesday, September 10, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. Pacific Time.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROPOSAL 1 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS A board of 12 directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting. Each elected director will hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successor is elected and qualified.

Ms. Cathleen Benko, Mr. John Rogers, Jr., and Mr. Robert Swan are nominated by the Board of Directors (the "Board") for election by the holders of NIKE's Class B Common Stock ("Class B Stock"). The other nine nominees are nominated by the Board for election by the holders of NIKE's Class A Common Stock ("Class A Stock"). Under Oregon law and our Bylaws, if a quorum of each class of shareholders is present at the Annual Meeting, the nine director nominees who receive the greatest number of votes cast by holders of Class A Stock and the three director nominees who receive the greatest number of votes cast by holders of Class B Stock will be elected as directors. Withheld votes and broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of the vote. Unless otherwise instructed, proxy holders will vote the proxies they receive for the election of each of the nominees listed below. If any nominee becomes unable to serve, the holders of the proxies may, in their discretion, vote the shares for a substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board. The Bylaws and the Corporate Governance Guidelines of the Company provide that any nominee for director in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from their election than votes "for" such election shall tender their resignation for consideration by the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee. The committee will then recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to the resignation, and the Board will publicly disclose its decision with respect to such resignation within 90 days after the certification of the election results. Background information on the nominees as of July 25, 2024, including certain of the attributes that led to their selection, appears below. The Board and the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee has determined that each director meets the qualification standards described below under "NIKE, Inc. Board of Directors—Director Nominations". In addition, while the Board believes that each director nominee is individually qualified to make unique and substantial contributions to the Board, the Board firmly believes that the experience, attributes, and skills of any single director nominee should not be viewed in isolation, but rather in the context of the experience, attributes, and skills that all director nominees bring to the Board as a whole, each of which contributes to the function of an effective Board.

INDIVIDUAL BOARD SKILLS MATRIX The matrix below represents some of the key experiences, attributes, and skills that the Board has identified as particularly valuable to the oversight of the Company, and illustrates how the director nominees individually and collectively represent them. While all of these qualifications were considered in connection with this year's director nomination process, the matrix does not encompass all of the experiences, attributes, and skills of the director nominees. The Board firmly believes that its highly qualified director nominees provide the Board with a diverse complement of skills, qualifications, and perspectives necessary for effective oversight.

The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee identifies potential director candidates through a variety of means, including recommendations from members of the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee or the Board, suggestions from Company management, and shareholder recommendations. The committee may, in its discretion, engage director search firms to identify candidates. Shareholders may recommend director candidates for consideration by the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee by submitting a written recommendation to the committee, c/o Corporate Secretary, NIKE, Inc., One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. The recommendation should include the candidate's name, age, qualifications (including principal occupation and employment history), and written consent to be named as a nominee in the Company's proxy statement and to serve as a director, if elected. The Board has adopted qualification standards for the selection of non-management nominees for director, which can be found on our corporate website: http://investors.nike.com. As provided in these standards and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, nominees for director are selected on the basis of, among other things, distinguished business experience or other non-business achievements; education; significant knowledge of international business, finance, marketing, technology, human resources, diversity, equity, and inclusion, law, or other fields which are complementary to, and balance the knowledge of, other Board members; a desire to represent and serve the interests of all shareholders; independence; good character; ethics; sound judgment; diversity; and ability to devote substantial time to discharge Board and committee responsibilities (including whether they are in compliance with the Board's overboarding policy). The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee identifies qualified potential candidates without regard to their age, gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, or religion. While the Board has no policy regarding Board member diversity, the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee considers and discusses diversity in selecting nominees for director and in the re-nomination of an incumbent director. The committee views diversity broadly to include, among other things, differences in backgrounds, qualifications, experiences, viewpoint, geographic location, education, skills and expertise (including financial, accounting, compliance, corporate social responsibility, public policy, cybersecurity, or other expertise relevant to service on the Board), professional and industry experience, and personal characteristics (including gender or gender identity, ethnicity/race, and sexual orientation). The Board believes that a variety and balance of perspectives on the Board results in more thoughtful and robust deliberations, and ultimately, better decisions. In considering the re-nomination of an incumbent director, the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee reviews the director's overall service to the Company during his or her term, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation, and quality of performance, as well as any special skills, experience, or diversity that such director brings to the Board. All potential new director candidates, whether recommended by shareholders or identified by other means, are initially screened by the Chair of the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee, who may seek additional information about the background and qualifications of the candidate, and who may determine that a candidate does not have qualifications that merit further consideration by the full committee. With respect to new director candidates who pass the initial screening, the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee meets to discuss and consider each candidate's qualifications and potential contributions to the Board, and determines by majority vote whether to recommend such candidate to the Board. The final decision to either appoint a candidate to fill a vacancy between annual meetings or include a candidate on the slate of nominees proposed at an annual meeting is made by the Board. As set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, it is the general policy of the Board that directors will not stand for re‑election after reaching the age of 72. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Pursuant to New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing rules, in order for a director to qualify as "independent", the Board must affirmatively determine that the director has no material relationship with the Company. The Board affirmatively determined that commercial or charitable relationships below the following thresholds will not be considered material relationships that impair a director's independence: (1) if a NIKE director or immediate family member is an executive officer of another company that does business with NIKE and the annual sales to, or purchases from, NIKE are less than one percent of the annual revenues of the other company; and (2) if a NIKE director or immediate family member serves as an officer, director, or trustee of a charitable organization, and NIKE's contributions to the organization are less than one percent of that organization's total annual charitable receipts. After applying this categorical standard and the applicable NYSE independence standards, the Board has determined that the following directors who served during fiscal 2024—Cathleen Benko, Timothy Cook, Thasunda Duckett, Mónica Gil, Alan Graf, Jr., Maria Henry, Peter Henry, Michelle Peluso, John Rogers, Jr., and Robert Swan—have no material relationship with the Company and, therefore, are independent. Messrs. John Donahoe II, Travis Knight, and Mark Parker were not independent pursuant to NYSE rules. Messrs. Donahoe and Parker were not independent pursuant to NYSE rules because they were employed by the Company during fiscal 2024. Mr. Knight was not independent pursuant to NYSE rules because he is the son of 19 NIKE, INC. NIKE's co-founder, Mr. Philip Knight, who received compensation in excess of the threshold set forth in applicable NYSE rules for his position as Chairman Emeritus. The compensation paid to Mr. Philip Knight is described in the section below titled "Additional Information—Transactions with Related Persons". BOARD STRUCTURE AND RESPONSIBILITIES The Board is currently composed of ten independent directors and three directors who are not independent under the NYSE listing rules. During fiscal 2024, there were four meetings of the Board and all of our directors attended at least 75 percent of the total number of meetings of the Board and committees on which he or she served. The Company encourages all directors to attend each annual meeting of shareholders, and all directors attended the 2023 annual meeting. BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE NIKE's governing documents provide the Board with flexibility to select the appropriate leadership structure of the Company. In determining the leadership structure, the Board considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business, fulfilling the duties of the Board, and the best interests of the Company's shareholders. Effective January 2020, the Company separated the position of Chair of the Board from the position of President and CEO, although this is not a permanent policy of the Board. The Board believes this leadership structure is appropriate for the Company because it separates the leadership of the Board from the duties of day-to-day leadership of the Company. The Executive Chairman, Mr. Mark Parker, presides over meetings of the Board and shareholders. The President and CEO, Mr. John Donahoe II, is in charge of the general supervision, direction, and control of the business and affairs of the Company, subject to the overall direction and supervision of the Board and its committees. Additionally, as part of the Board's commitment to strong independent Board leadership and oversight, the Board has adopted a policy requiring the appointment of a Lead Independent Director at any time when the Chair of the Board is not independent. The position of Lead Independent Director is entrusted with robust and clearly-defined duties, including: • serving as a liaison between the Chair and the independent directors; • approving the meeting agendas for the Board; • advising the Chair regarding the sufficiency, quality, quantity, and timeliness of information provided to the Board; • ensuring that meeting schedules permit sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; • providing consultation and direct communication with major shareholders, if requested; • presiding at meetings of the Board at which the Chair is not present, including executive sessions; and • performing other duties specified in the Lead Independent Director Charter. In June 2022, the Board re-appointed Mr. Timothy Cook to serve as Lead Independent Director for a term of three years. Mr. Cook continues to serve as Lead Independent Director of the Company working in collaboration with Messrs. Parker and Donahoe. The chairs of Board committees also play an active role in the leadership structure of the Board. The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee and the Board endeavor to select independent committee chairs who will provide strong leadership to guide the important work of the Board committees. Committee chairs work with the Company's senior executives to ensure the committees are discussing the key strategic risks and opportunities of the Company. In the absence of the Lead Independent Director, a presiding director is appointed to chair executive sessions of non-management directors (consisting of all directors other than Messrs. Parker and Donahoe). The position of presiding director is rotated among the chairs of the various Board committees, other than the Executive Committee. Executive sessions are regularly scheduled and held at least once each year. Mr. Philip Knight, NIKE's co-founder, serves as Chairman Emeritus, with a standing invitation to attend meetings of the Board and its committees as a non-voting observer. The Board believes that it benefits from his valuable experience and insights. For all of these reasons, the Board believes this leadership structure is optimal. BOARD COMMITTEES The Board's current standing committees are an Audit & Finance Committee; a Compensation Committee; a Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee; and an Executive Committee. The Board may appoint other committees from time to time. Each standing committee has a written charter and all such charters, as well as the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, are available on the Company's corporate website, http://investors.nike.com, and will be provided in print 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 20 to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453.

The Executive Committee held no formal meetings during fiscal 2024, but took action by unanimous written consent. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 22 THE BOARD’S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT While the Company's management team is responsible for day-to-day management of the various risks facing the Company, the Board takes an active role in the oversight of the management of critical business risks. The Board does not view risk in isolation. Risks are considered in virtually every business decision and as part of NIKE's business strategy. The Board recognizes it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential for the Company to be competitive on a global basis and to achieve its strategic objectives. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through committees, which play a significant role in carrying out risk oversight. While the Audit & Finance Committee is responsible for oversight of management's risk management policies, oversight responsibility for particular areas of risk is allocated among the Board committees according to the committee's area of responsibility as reflected in the committee charters. BOARD COMMITTEES The AUDIT & FINANCE COMMITTEE oversees risks related to the Company's financial statements, the financial reporting process, accounting, legal matters, investments, access to capital and capital deployment, currency risk and hedging programs, information security (including risks related to cybersecurity), and data protection. The committee oversees the internal audit function, reviews a risk-based plan of internal audits, and reviews a risk-based integrated audit of internal controls over financial reporting. The committee meets separately with the Vice President of Global Audit and Chief Risk Officer, representatives of the independent registered public accountants, and senior management. The COMPENSATION COMMITTEE oversees risks associated with the Company's compensation philosophy and programs and executive succession and development. The CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY, SUSTAINABILITY & GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE oversees risks associated with corporate social purpose and company governance, including NIKE's Code of Conduct and its compliance programs, and the structure and performance of the Board and its committees. The committee also oversees protection of the Company's corporate reputation including issues that involve social and community engagement, workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion, and sustainability relating to the Company's products, its supply chain (including labor practices), and the environment. EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM Each committee chair works with one or more senior executives assigned to assist the committee in: developing agendas for the year and for each meeting, paying particular attention to areas of business risk identified by management, Board members, internal and external auditors, and in their committee charter; and scheduling agenda topics, presentations, and discussions regarding business risks within their area of responsibility. At meetings, the committees discuss areas of business risk, the potential impact, and management's initiatives to manage business risk, often within the context of important business decisions. Through this process, key business risk areas are reviewed at appropriate times, with some topics reviewed on multiple occasions throughout the year. At every Board meeting, each committee chair provides a report to the full Board outlining the committee's discussions and actions, including those affecting the oversight of various risks. The Company believes its leadership structure, discussed in detail above, further supports the risk oversight function of the Board. Strong directors chair the various committees involved in risk oversight, there is open communication between management and directors, and all directors are involved in the risk oversight function. THE BOARD’S ROLE IN ESG OVERSIGHT The Board takes an active role overseeing NIKE's commitment to, and progress on, environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") matters. The Board oversees ESG matters primarily through the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance 23 NIKE, INC. Committee. In addition to overseeing corporate governance (generally, the "G" in "ESG"), this committee also oversees the risks and opportunities associated with NIKE's Purpose to move the world forward through the power of sport, with a focus on the three pillars of people, planet, and play (generally, the "E" and "S" in "ESG"). The committee's responsibilities include reviewing and providing guidance to management regarding significant Purpose strategies, activities, policies, investments, and programs; reviewing the development of NIKE's five-year Purpose targets and long-term sustainability targets, and monitoring the Company's progress towards those targets; and reviewing and providing guidance to management regarding NIKE's annual Impact Report, which describes our progress towards our Purpose targets for our shareholders and other stakeholders. The Compensation Committee also plays a key role with respect to ESG by overseeing talent management and development for executive officers and senior management, including with respect to employee engagement and workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion. More information about Purpose, including NIKE's annual Impact Report, is available on the Impact section of our website. SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS WITH DIRECTORS Shareholders or interested parties desiring to communicate directly with the Board or with any individual director may do so in writing addressed to the intended recipient or recipients, c/o Corporate Secretary, NIKE, Inc., One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. The Office of the Corporate Secretary reviews all such communications and refers relevant correspondence directly to a director, as appropriate. In addition, the Office of the Corporate Secretary regularly summarizes for the Board all communications that relate to the functions of the Board or its committees or that otherwise warrant Board attention. CODE OF CONDUCT The NIKE Code of Conduct is available at the Company's corporate website, http://investors.nike.com, and will be provided in print without charge to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453. The Code of Conduct applies to all of the Company's employees and directors, including our CEO and all other executive officers. The Code of Conduct provides that any waiver of the Code of Conduct for executive officers or directors may be made only by the Board or a committee of the Board. Any such waiver will be publicly disclosed, when required by law. The Company plans to disclose amendments to, and waivers from, the Code of Conduct on the Company's corporate website: http://investors.nike.com. CAPITAL STRUCTURE Since NIKE's initial public offering in 1980, the Company's articles of incorporation have provided for NIKE to have two classes of voting stock, consisting of the Class A Stock and the Class B Stock. RIGHTS OF COMMON STOCK The shares of Class A Stock and Class B Stock have identical voting and economic rights except that the holders of the Class A Stock and Class B Stock vote as separate classes for purposes of electing directors. Specifically, for as long as the number of outstanding shares of Class B Stock is between 25% and 87.5% of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (as is currently the case), the holders of the Class B Stock, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect 25% of the Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number) and the holders of the Class A Stock, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect the remaining directors. If at any time the outstanding number of shares of Class A Stock is less than 12.5% of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, then the Class B Stock, voting as a separate class, will continue to have the right to elect 25% of the Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number), but the Class A Stock and Class B Stock will vote together as a single class to elect the remaining directors. Outside of director elections, the Class A Stock and Class B Stock vote together on all other matters, with each Class A share and Class B share having one vote per share. Because twelve directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting and the outstanding number of shares of Class B Stock is between 25% and 87.5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the holders of the Class B Stock are entitled to elect three directors at the Annual Meeting and the holders of the Class A Stock are entitled to elect the remaining nine. For each other matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting (including Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8), the Class A Stock and Class B Stock will vote together as a single class, each with one vote per share. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 24 Each share of Class A Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Stock. Such conversion is solely at the option of the holder, and cannot be dictated by either the Company or the Board. The Class A Stock is currently primarily held by Swoosh, LLC, an entity that was formed by Mr. Philip Knight, NIKE's co-founder, in 2015 to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Stock. For additional information regarding NIKE's classes of Common Stock, see the description of the Company's securities included as Exhibit 4.7 to NIKE's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024. For additional information regarding key holders of the Class A Stock and Class B Stock, see the section below titled "Stock Ownership Information—Stock Holdings of Certain Owners and Management". STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES Our unique capital structure enables NIKE to focus on long-term strategy, which our Board believes is critical to creating long-term value. This long-term vision enables the Company to prioritize research and development and innovation, to invest in transformations in support of our strategic objectives, and to integrate Purpose into our business strategy. It also helps to preserve and advance NIKE's unique culture, which we believe powers our success. At the same time, our capital structure meaningfully protects and represents the interests of our public Class B shareholders. Each share of our Class A Stock and Class B Stock carries the same economic rights and risks, which helps align the interests of our Class A and Class B shareholders. All of our directors, regardless of which class of Common Stock elected them, have fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of all NIKE shareholders. In addition, all directors are subject to the same nomination and evaluation processes, which are described in the section above titled "NIKE, Inc. Board of Directors—Director Nominations", and the Board considers all directors when assessing the mixture of experience, attributes, and skills represented on the Board. All of the directors nominated for election by our Class B shareholders, as well as six out of nine of the directors nominated for election by our Class A shareholders, are independent, and only independent directors sit on the Audit & Finance Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee. INVESTOR FEEDBACK Although the Board cannot change or eliminate our dual class capital structure without the approval of the holders of the Class A Stock, the Company believes it is important to engage regularly with Class B shareholders to understand their views on NIKE's capital structure. The majority of shareholders with whom we engaged since our last annual meeting expressed that they did not have specific concerns with the Company's dual class structure in light of the fact that it provides for equal voting and economic rights on all matters other than the election of directors, as well as the Company's long history of robust corporate governance practices, strong and effective Board oversight, and highly qualified directors. They also appreciated the Board's responsiveness to feedback, including the refreshment of the slate of Class B director nominees in 2023 to include a member from each of the three key Board committees: the Audit & Finance Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee. SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT Our approach to governance is informed by the insights and perspectives of our Class B shareholders. We greatly value the opportunity to engage with and solicit feedback from our shareholders regarding matters involving the Company, with a focus on ESG matters, and we believe that maintaining an open dialogue strengthens the Company's approach to its corporate governance practices and disclosures. Below is an overview of the Company's fiscal 2024 engagement practices regarding ESG matters. These ESG-related engagements take place in addition to regular financial-related outreach led by our Investor Relations team and engagement with shareholder proponents led by our Office of the Corporate Secretary. INTEGRATED ENGAGEMENT TEAM TYPES OF ENGAGEMENT KEY FISCAL 2024 ENGAGEMENT TOPICS • Independent Directors • Investor Relations • Total Rewards and Executive Compensation • Office of the Corporate Secretary • One-on-one meetings • E-mail communications • NIKE leadership structure • Board composition and evergreen refreshment • Risk oversight • Capital structure • Executive compensation • Responsible sourcing In fiscal 2024, we reached out to shareholders representing 46% of our Class B shares and engaged with shareholders representing 43% of our Class B shares 25 NIKE, INC. The Board is committed to understanding the views of our shareholders. Therefore, the Chair of our Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee actively participated in engagements with certain of the Company's largest investors during fiscal 2024. In addition, management and our Board leadership reports key themes and feedback that emerge during these engagements to the full Board and any relevant committees, so that we can continue to refine and adapt our practices to better address the issues that our shareholders raise with us. The Board and management carefully consider and integrate shareholder feedback into the Company's practices and disclosures. Recent changes to our practices include refining our fiscal 2024 executive compensation program, including by evolving the long-term incentive award mix to include 50% performance-based restricted stock units (as described in the section below titled "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation of our Named Executive Officers—Long-Term Incentive"); adopting an overboarding policy in 2024 to increase clarity and transparency about the Board's expectations that directors devote appropriate time to Board responsibilities; and refreshing the slate of Class B director nominees in 2023 to include a member of each of the key Board committees. We have also enhanced our proxy statement disclosures over the past several years in response to shareholder feedback, including providing additional detail and transparency regarding Board diversity, Board oversight of ESG, and our capital structure.

The grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of our Class B Stock on the grant date. As of May 31, 2024, Ms. Henry held 3,711 shares of unvested restricted stock, each other non-employee director held 1,981shares of unvested restricted stock, and no non-employee director held any outstanding stock options. (2) Consists of matched contributions to charities under the NIKE Matching Gift Program. (3) For Ms. Henry, who was appointed to the Board effective June 1, 2023, stock awards consist of a one-time, sign-on grant of restricted stock as well as an annual restricted stock award, each as described in the section below titled "Director Fees and Arrangements". DIRECTOR FEES AND ARRANGEMENTS Under our director compensation program in effect for fiscal 2024, non-employee directors receive: • An annual retainer of $100,000, paid in quarterly installments. • Upon appointment to the Board, a one-time, sign-on restricted stock award valued at $200,000 on the date of grant, generally, the date of appointment. The one-time, sign-on restricted stock award is subject to forfeiture in the event that service as a director terminates prior to the first anniversary of the date of grant. • An annual restricted stock award valued at $200,000 on the date of grant, generally, the date of each annual meeting of shareholders. The number of restricted shares granted to each director for fiscal 2024 was determined by dividing the director's award value by the average closing price of our Class B Stock for the 20-trading day period ending on the date of grant. The annual restricted stock award is subject to forfeiture in the event that service as a director terminates prior to the earlier of the next annual meeting and the last day of the 12 th full calendar month following the date of grant. • For the Lead Independent Director, an annual retainer of $40,000, paid in quarterly installments. • For chairs of Board committees (other than the Executive Committee), an annual retainer of $25,000 for each committee chaired ($30,000 for the chair of the Audit & Finance Committee), paid in quarterly installments. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 26 • For Audit & Finance Committee members, an additional annual retainer of $5,000, paid in quarterly installments. • Payment or reimbursement of travel and other expenses incurred in attending Board meetings. • Matching charitable contributions under the NIKE Matching Gift Program, under which directors are eligible to contribute to qualified charitable organizations and the Company provides a matching contribution to the charities in an equal amount, up to $20,000 in the aggregate, for each director annually. Neither Mr. Donahoe nor Mr. Parker received any additional compensation for services provided as a director in fiscal 2024. STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES FOR DIRECTORS NIKE maintains stock ownership guidelines for all non-employee directors. Under these guidelines, directors are required to hold NIKE stock valued at five times their annual cash retainer. New directors are required to attain these ownership levels within five years of their election to the Board. Each of our directors has met or is on track to meet the specified ownership level. DIRECTOR PARTICIPATION IN DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN Under our Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors may elect in advance to defer up to 100 percent of the director fees paid by the Company. For a description of the plan, see the section below titled "Executive Compensation—Executive Compensation Tables—Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation in Fiscal 2024—Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans". 27 NIKE, INC. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL 2 SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we are submitting to shareholders our annual "say-on-pay proposal", an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as described in this proxy statement. At our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, approximately 88% of the votes cast on the say-on-pay proposal were voted in favor of the proposal. The Compensation Committee is committed to understanding the views of our shareholders with respect to the executive compensation program. Therefore, during fiscal 2024, the committee considered the results of the 2023 say-on-pay proposal, which the committee believes affirm shareholders' support of the Company's approach to executive compensation and the committee's decisions, as well as direct feedback from shareholders provided during management and Board engagements. As discussed in this section, our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain top-tier talent and maximize shareholder value. To achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program and emphasize pay-for-performance principles, the Compensation Committee has continued to employ strong governance practices, including: • basing a majority of total compensation on performance incentives; • setting incentive award targets based on clearly disclosed, objective performance measures; • mitigating undue risk associated with compensation by using multiple performance targets, caps on potential incentive payments, a clawback policy, and additional standalone clawback provisions; and • requiring executive officers to hold NIKE stock through published stock ownership guidelines. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board. However, the Board values shareholder opinions, and the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. BOARD RECOMMENDATION The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote FOR approval of the following resolution: RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the fiscal 2024 compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables). 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 28 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes our compensation program, philosophy, decisions, and process for the compensation of our Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2024: NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER TITLE John Donahoe II President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker Executive Chairman Matthew Friend Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Heidi O'Neill President, Consumer, Product & Brand Craig Williams President, Geographies & Marketplace This Compensation Discussion and Analysis is organized into four sections: • Executive Summary (page 30) • Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers (page 32) • Our Compensation Process (page 39) • Other Compensation Practices (page 40) Key Defined Terms TERM DEFINITION 401(k) Plan 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of NIKE, Inc.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION • We follow a pay for performance philosophy, intended to drive business results and maximize shareholder value. Compensation is therefore highly incentive-based and heavily weighted towards long-term awards to emphasize long-term performance. • We strive every day to win as a team . To foster teamwork, and ensure internal pay equity, we utilize a cohort approach by aligning compensation across executive roles. • We value shareholder feedback . We consider the results of our annual say-on-pay vote—88% in favor last year, which we believe affirms shareholders' support of our executive compensation approach and decisions—as well as feedback shared directly through our shareholder engagement efforts described on page 25. DIRECT COMPENSATION ELEMENTS NIKE's direct compensation for the Named Executive Officers generally consists of the following elements: ELEMENT KEY CHARACTERISTICS PURPOSE Base Salary Fixed cash compensation Provides market competitive baseline compensation to attract and retain top-tier talent Annual Cash Incentive Award – PSP Variable cash incentive compensation earned at 0% – 200% based on Company performance over a 1-year performance period Motivates and rewards achievement of sustainable and profitable growth Long-Term Incentive Award – SIP PSUs (50% (1) ) Variable stock-based incentive compensation earned at 0% – 200% based on Company performance over a 3-year performance period; value dependent upon achievement of performance metrics and our stock price Aligns NEOs' interests with those of our shareholders by motivating and rewarding achievement of long-term shareholder value and growth; promotes retention Stock Options (35% (1) ) Stock-based incentive compensation that generally vests in 4 equal annual installments; only provides value if our stock price appreciates Aligns NEOs' interests with those of our shareholders by rewarding achievement of upside potential; promotes retention RSUs (15% (1) ) Stock-based incentive compensation that generally vests in 3 equal annual installments; value tied to our stock price Aligns NEOs' interests with those of our shareholders by rewarding long-term value creation; promotes retention (1)    Percentages reflect the long-term incentive award mix for all NEOs except Mr. Parker who, due to his role as Executive Chairman, received his long-term incentive award 100% in the form of stock options. FISCAL 2024 PROGRAM ENHANCEMENTS The following outlines enhancements to the executive compensation program for fiscal 2024: PROGRAM ELEMENT OBJECTIVE ENHANCEMENT (1) Annual Cash Incentive Award – PSP Focus on top-line growth and overall profitability Streamlined plan to two equally-weighted metrics—Adjusted Revenue (for driving top-line growth) and Adjusted EBIT (for managing overall profitability)—by eliminating adjusted digital revenue as a metric Incentivize and reward exceptional performance, while balancing achievability Increased the spread between threshold and maximum by increasing the maximum level (from 150% to 200%) and decreasing the threshold level (from 50% to 25%) Long-Term Incentive Award – SIP Further strengthen the connection between pay and performance, and respond to shareholder feedback Increased the portion of the long-term incentive award granted in the form of PSUs to 50%, with the remainder delivered in the form of stock options (35%) and RSUs (15%) (1)    Program enhancements applied to all NEOs except Mr. Parker who, due to his role as Executive Chairman, did not receive a PSP award and received his long-term incentive award 100% in the form of stock options. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 30 INCENTIVE AWARD OUTCOMES The following summarizes incentive award outcomes for fiscal 2024. For more information on incentive award outcomes for the NEOs, see the sections below titled "Compensation of our Named Executive Officers—Annual Cash Incentive" and "Compensation of our Named Executive Officers—Long-Term Incentive—Fiscal 2022 Award Results".

COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES AND STRUCTURE Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain top-tier talent in a competitive marketplace and to maximize shareholder value by rewarding NEOs for strong Company performance. The program consists of direct compensation, with a focus on incentive compensation, and competitive benefits that are generally consistent with the benefits offered to our other U.S.-based employees. We structure our executive compensation program in the context of our business strategy and talent plan. To foster teamwork and ensure internal pay equity, we utilize a segmented cohort approach that aligns compensation across certain executive roles. Cohort compensation levels are determined by holistically considering factors relating to our business, the competitive market for top-tier talent, and the applicable executives—including future potential, individual performance, market insights, succession planning, retention, and leadership continuity. Our philosophy is to "pay for performance" in order to drive business results and maximize shareholder value. As a result, executive compensation is highly incentive-based and weighted towards long-term awards to emphasize long-term performance and support retention. Our executive compensation program balances performance incentives, including by using multiple performance metrics and periods, and through a mixture of cash- and stock-based compensation elements. Stock-based compensation—which consists of PSUs, stock options, and RSUs—is also structured to pay for performance by linking the majority of each NEO's target total direct compensation directly to our stock price. The following charts illustrate the mix of components that make up fiscal 2024 target total direct compensation for our NEOs. *    "Other NEOs" represents each of Mr. Friend, Ms. O'Neill, and Mr. Williams, and excludes Mr. Parker whose compensation is structured differently due to his role as Executive Chairman. BASE SALARY Base salary is a fixed element of compensation that serves to attract and retain top-tier talent. Generally, the Compensation Committee reviews and determines base salaries for our Named Executive Officers in June, with any adjustments becoming effective in August of the same year. The Compensation Committee set Mr. Williams' base salary to align with his applicable cohort in connection with his appointment as President of Geographies & Marketplace. Fiscal 2024 base salaries for each other Named Executive Officer remained unchanged compared to fiscal 2023. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 32 NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER FISCAL 2024 BASE SALARY % CHANGE John Donahoe II $1,500,000 0% Mark Parker $1,000,000 0% Matthew Friend $1,250,000 0% Heidi O'Neill $1,250,000 0% Craig Williams $1,250,000 N/A ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE Annual cash incentive awards are paid to the Named Executive Officers under our PSP and are designed to reflect our "pay for performance" philosophy. For fiscal 2024, PSP awards were eligible to be earned between 0% and 200% of target based on Company performance during the fiscal year. The Compensation Committee retains discretion to adjust PSP metrics and award payouts based on individual or Company performance. To align employees and reinforce our one-team culture, the same compensation philosophy and metrics that underlie our PSP awards generally apply to all global employees who are eligible to participate in the Company's success through annual incentive bonuses. The Compensation Committee set the PSP target award for Mr. Williams to align with his applicable cohort in connection with his appointment as President of Geographies & Marketplace. For each other NEO, the committee maintained fiscal 2024 PSP target awards at the same level as his or her fiscal 2023 PSP target award. Therefore, the fiscal 2024 PSP target awards were: NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER FISCAL 2024 PSP TARGET AWARD (% OF BASE SALARY) John Donahoe II 200% Mark Parker 0% Matthew Friend 120% Heidi O'Neill 120% Craig Williams 120% In June 2023, the Compensation Committee reviewed our annual cash incentive program and determined to make the following changes for the fiscal 2024 PSP awards in order to drive sustained engagement, motivation, and Company performance and to better align with NIKE's business strategy and culture: • Streamlined the metrics to Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBIT (eliminating the adjusted digital revenue metric used in prior year awards) to focus on driving top-line growth and managing overall profitability, respectively. • Increased the spread between threshold and maximum earnout levels by increasing the maximum to 200% of target (from 150%) and decreasing the threshold to 25% of target (from 50%), to incentivize and reward exceptional performance while balancing achievability. Consistent with the prior year, the committee maintained equal weighting for the metrics (with the weight of each metric increasing to 50% due to the decrease from three metrics to two) as well as a single, year-long performance period. In setting the year-long performance goals for the PSP, the Compensation Committee sought to drive sustainable and profitable growth. Accordingly, the Adjusted Revenue target goal represented an increase of 5% compared to actual fiscal 2023 revenue, with threshold and maximum goals set equidistant from the target goal to balance stretch and risk. The Adjusted EBIT target goal represented an increase of 15% compared to actual fiscal 2023 EBIT, with threshold and maximum goals set non-equidistant from the target goal; the additional upside stretch was built into the maximum goal to incentivize exceptional performance. For fiscal 2024, Adjusted Revenue of $51.7 billion corresponded to an earnout of 37% and Adjusted EBIT of $7.1 billion corresponded to an earnout of 93%. These earnouts were averaged together to calculate a PSP payout of 65% for all executive officers. The fiscal 2024 PSP performance goals, achievement levels, and payout are illustrated below. 33 NIKE, INC. FISCAL 2024 PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESULTS (Dollars in millions) % PAYOUT THRESHOLD 25% TARGET 100% MAXIMUM 200% Adjusted Revenue (1) (Weighted 50%) EARNOUT: 37% Adjusted EBIT (1) (Weighted 50%) EARNOUT: 93% FISCAL 2024 PSP PAYOUT 65% (1)     As described on page 29, each metric excluded the impact of certain non-operational events to help drive and reward organic growth. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE Long-term incentive compensation incentivizes and rewards long-term Company performance, aligns executives' interests with those of our shareholders, and promotes retention in a highly competitive talent marketplace. Therefore, this element of our executive compensation program forms the largest portion of our Named Executive Officers' direct compensation, constituting 81% of fiscal 2024 target total direct compensation for Mr. Donahoe (67% for Mr. Parker and 74% for each other NEO). Long-term incentive compensation consists of three components: PSUs, stock options, and RSUs, each granted under our SIP. In fiscal 2024, the Compensation Committee finished a multi-year evolution to increase the proportion of the total long-term incentive award delivered in the form of PSUs to 50%. Therefore, fiscal 2024 NEO awards were delivered 50% as PSUs, 35% as stock options, and 15% as RSUs (excluding Mr. Parker, whose long-term incentive award is delivered entirely as stock options due to his role as Executive Chairman). Consistent with prior years, the Company made grants of fiscal 2024 long-term incentive awards to executive officers (including NEOs) on August 1, 2023. The Compensation Committee determined in June 2024 to align the grant date for long-term incentive awards to executive officers (including NEOs) with the grant date for employees below the executive officer level. Accordingly, awards for fiscal 2025 and thereafter are expected to be granted to executive officers (including NEOs) on September 1 of each fiscal year. FISCAL 2024 AWARD GRANTS The Compensation Committee determined the fiscal 2024 long-term incentive awards in June 2023. With respect to the mix of the long-term incentive award components, the Compensation Committee completed a multi-year evolution to increase the proportion delivered in PSUs. In setting the value of each long-term incentive award, the committee considered multiple factors, including individual and Company performance, evolving responsibilities, our cohort compensation approach, and retaining top-tier talent in a highly competitive talent marketplace. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 34 Accordingly, the Compensation Committee increased the target value of Mr. Donahoe's long-term incentive award by $2,000,000 compared to fiscal 2023, which consisted of a PSU increase of $1,600,000, a stock option increase of $350,000, and an RSU increase of $50,000. Given Mr. Parker's responsibilities as Executive Chairman, the committee maintained his same award value and mix compared to fiscal 2023. For each of Mr. Friend and Ms. O'Neill, the Compensation Committee increased the target long-term incentive award by $2,500,000, which consisted in each case of a PSU increase of $2,000,000, a stock option increase of $700,000, and an RSU decrease of $200,000. The committee set the target value and mix of Mr. Williams' long-term incentive award to align with his applicable cohort in connection with his appointment as President of Geographies & Marketplace. The fiscal 2024 long-term incentive award values were: NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER TOTAL FISCAL 2024 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD TARGET PSUs (50%) (1) STOCK OPTIONS (35%) (1) RSUs (15%) (1) John Donahoe II $19,000,000 → $9,500,000 $6,650,000 $2,850,000 Mark Parker $2,000,000 → — $2,000,000 — Matthew Friend $8,000,000 → $4,000,000 $2,800,000 $1,200,000 Heidi O'Neill $8,000,000 → $4,000,000 $2,800,000 $1,200,000 Craig Williams $8,000,000 → $4,000,000 $2,800,000 $1,200,000 (1)    Percentages reflect the long-term incentive award mix for all Named Executive Officers except Mr. Parker, whose long-term incentive award was delivered 100% in stock options. 2024 – 2026 PSUs PSUs align our Named Executive Officers' interests with those of our shareholders by motivating and rewarding achievement of long-term shareholder value and growth. PSU awards reflect our "pay for performance" philosophy: they are earned between 0% and 200% of target based on Company performance during a three-year performance period. In June 2023, the Compensation Committee selected the metric, corresponding performance goals, and award terms for the fiscal 2024 – 2026 PSU awards. The committee will determine the earnout of the fiscal 2024 – 2026 PSU awards following the completion of the three-year performance period, and any PSUs that are earned will vest on August 1, 2026. Consistent with the prior year's awards, the Compensation Committee selected Relative TSR as the metric for the fiscal 2024 – 2026 PSU awards and continued to target above-median performance as shown in the table below: FISCAL 2024 – 2026 PERFORMANCE GOALS % PAYOUT THRESHOLD 25% TARGET 100% MAXIMUM 200% Relative TSR (1) (1) Relative TSR for fiscal years 2024, 2025, and 2026, calculated using the 20-trading day average stock price and assuming that dividends paid during the performance period are reinvested in the applicable company's stock. PSUs will be earned at 100% of target if the Company's Relative TSR for the performance period is at the 55 th percentile, and will be earned at 0% if the Company's Relative TSR for the performance period is below the 25 th percentile. PSU earnout based on Relative TSR performance is subject to a cap of 100% of target if Absolute TSR for the performance period is negative. The Compensation Committee selected three-year Relative TSR as the performance metric because it is an objective and transparent measure of long-term shareholder value, especially in the context of a volatile market. Furthermore, the cap on payout if Absolute TSR is negative incentivizes NEOs to pursue long-term growth. The fiscal 2024 – 2026 PSU awards also contain a People & Planet modifier designed to support our commitment to Purpose, which is a key component of our long-term strategy. If Relative TSR meets or exceeds the threshold performance goal, the People & Planet modifier permits the Compensation Committee to adjust the earnout upwards or downwards by up to 20 percentage points (subject to both the 200% maximum earnout and the 100% Absolute TSR cap) based on a holistic assessment of the Company's performance with respect to employee engagement and inclusion, leadership diversity, and sustainability. Structuring the modifier as a holistic assessment ensures that the final earnout comprehensively balances these broad and disparate issues and appropriately reflects the spirit of our Purpose commitment. The target number of PSUs granted to each Named Executive Officer for fiscal 2024 was determined by dividing the NEO's target award value by the average closing price of our Class B Stock for the 20-trading day period ending on the date of grant. PSUs accumulate dividend equivalents that are paid only when, and to the extent, they vest. To promote retention, the PSU awards generally provide that any unvested PSUs are forfeited if the Named Executive Officer leaves the Company. Forfeiture is subject to partial accelerated vesting upon termination of employment in connection with a divestiture or reduction in force (as described in the section below titled "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control"). 35 NIKE, INC. STOCK OPTIONS Stock options align our Named Executive Officers' interests with those of our shareholders by rewarding the achievement of upside potential, and they reflect our "pay for performance" philosophy by rewarding the NEOs only if the price of our Class B Stock appreciates. The number of stock options granted to each NEO for fiscal 2024 was determined by dividing the NEO's award value by the Black-Scholes value (calculated based on a 20-day average stock price and the available five-year and seven-year interest rates) of a stock option on the date of grant. Options granted to the Named Executive Officers vest in equal annual installments over four years and have an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant (or the trading day immediately prior to the grant date, if the grant date is not a trading day). To promote retention, stock options generally provide that if a Named Executive Officer leaves the Company, they forfeit any unvested stock options. Forfeiture is subject to a limited retirement provision designed to encourage executives to delay retirement, as well as partial accelerated vesting upon termination of employment in connection with a divestiture or reduction in force (each as described in the section below titled "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control"). RSUs RSUs align our Named Executive Officers' interests with those of our shareholders by rewarding the achievement of long-term value creation, and they reflect our "pay for performance" philosophy because their value is directly tied to our Class B Stock price. The number of RSUs granted to each NEO for fiscal 2024 was determined by dividing the NEO's award value by the average closing price of our Class B Stock for the 20-trading day period ending on the date of grant. RSUs granted to the Named Executive Officers as part of long-term incentive compensation vest in equal annual installments over three years and accumulate dividend equivalents that are paid only upon vesting. To promote retention, RSU awards generally provide that any unvested RSUs are forfeited if the Named Executive Officer leaves the Company. Forfeiture is subject to partial accelerated vesting upon termination of employment in connection with a divestiture or reduction in force (as described in the section below titled "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control"). FISCAL 2022 AWARD RESULTS As previously disclosed in our 2022 proxy statement, the fiscal 2022 – 2024 PSU awards granted in June 2021 were to be earned between 0% and 200% of target based on Relative TSR over a three-year performance period (subject to a payout cap of 100% if Absolute TSR was negative). In addition, if Relative TSR was achieved at or above the threshold performance goal, a People & Planet modifier would allow the award payout to be increased or decreased by up to 20 percentage points (subject to both the 200% maximum earnout and the 100% Absolute TSR cap) based on a holistic assessment of the Company's performance with respect to employee engagement and inclusion, leadership diversity, and sustainability. NIKE's Relative TSR for fiscal years 2022 – 2024 was at the 10 th percentile, corresponding to an earnout of 0%. Relative TSR was calculated in comparison to the companies that were included in the S&P 500 as of May 31, 2024, using the 20-trading day average stock price and assuming that dividends paid during the performance period were reinvested in the applicable company's stock. Because Relative TSR was below the threshold performance goal, the People & Planet modifier was not applicable. Therefore, as illustrated below, the total payout for the fiscal 2022 – 2024 PSU awards was 0% for each of the NEOs. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 36 FISCAL 2022 – 2024 PERFORMANCE RESULTS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE METRIC % PAYOUT THRESHOLD 25% TARGET 100% MAXIMUM 200% Relative TSR EARNOUT: 0% PEOPLE & PLANET MODIFIER • The People & Planet modifier did not apply because Relative TSR performance was below the threshold performance level MODIFIER: 0% TOTAL PAYOUT 0% OTHER COMPENSATION PROFIT SHARING AND RETIREMENT PLANS We maintain a U.S. tax qualified retirement savings plan—the 401(k) Plan—under which all eligible U.S. employees, including the Named Executive Officers, are able to make pre-tax and after-tax contributions from their cash compensation. We make annual matching contributions for all participants equal to 100% of their pre-tax contributions up to 5% of their total eligible compensation. The Internal Revenue Code limits the amount of compensation that can be deferred under the 401(k) Plan, and also limits the amount of salary and annual cash incentive award ($330,000 for fiscal 2024) that may be taken into account when determining contributions under that plan. Accordingly, we provide our Named Executive Officers and other highly compensated employees with the opportunity to defer their compensation, including amounts in excess of the tax law limit, under our nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. We do not match deferrals to the Deferred Compensation Plan. Balances in the Deferred Compensation Plan, including the balances of the Named Executive Officers, are unsecured and at-risk, meaning that the balances may be forfeited in the event of the Company's financial distress, such as bankruptcy. Fiscal 2024 matching contributions to the Named Executive Officers under the 401(k) Plan are included in the All Other Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table on page 42. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees in the United States and in many countries outside of the United States, including the Named Executive Officers, to purchase Class B Stock through payroll deductions at a 15% discount to the market price on the first or last trading day of the six-month purchase period, depending on which day the stock price was lower. 37 NIKE, INC. PERQUISITES AND OTHER BENEFITS Our executive compensation program includes limited perquisites and other personal benefits for our Named Executive Officers, which generally consist of home security and financial planning services. Given the nature of our business, from time to time certain Company employees, including certain executive officers, may also receive Company product, event tickets, or travel benefits that are not generally offered to all employees. In addition, Mr. Donahoe and Mr. Parker are entitled to limited personal use of Company aircraft, primarily pursuant to time sharing agreements, which is intended to increase the security, availability, and productivity of these individuals. They are also entitled to enhanced charitable gift matching under our Employee Matching Gift Program—a program designed to encourage and support employees in giving back to our communities and creating positive change—with an executive contribution limit of $1,000,000 per calendar year and Company matching on a 4:1 basis. Our Employee Matching Gift Program does not match employee contributions that benefit the employee, including contributions to the employee's personal or family foundation or to a non-profit organization that is managed or led by, or provides compensation or assistance to, the employee or a member of their family. Because the Employee Matching Gift Program is managed on a calendar year basis while the Summary Compensation Table reports compensation for the fiscal year, the charitable matching amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table may exceed $4,000,000 (up to a maximum of $8,000,000) due to the timing of charitable contributions. For fiscal 2024, Mr. Donahoe and Mr. Parker each donated to a range of charitable causes. We do not provide any tax gross-ups on perquisites to our executive officers. Greater detail about the perquisites and personal benefits provided to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2024 is provided in the footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table on page 42. NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENTS In exchange for non-competition agreements from each of our Named Executive Officers, we have agreed to provide monthly payments during the non-compete period following termination of employment, as described in the section below titled "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control". We believe that it is appropriate to compensate individuals to refrain from working with competitors following termination, and that compensation enhances the enforceability of such agreements. LETTER AGREEMENTS We do not have employment contracts with any of our executive officers, other than letter agreements with Messrs. Donahoe and Parker that provide for the enhanced charitable matching benefit described in the section above titled "Perquisites and Other Benefits". 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 38 OUR COMPENSATION PROCESS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE The Compensation Committee oversees our executive compensation program, including determining the value and composition of the compensation package for each of our executive officers and setting annual performance goals for the CEO. In addition to any special actions the Compensation Committee may take throughout the year, the committee generally acts with respect to compensation for our Named Executive Officers during the fiscal year as follows: PEER GROUP Given the competitive market for top-tier talent, the Compensation Committee uses a peer group (consisting of companies with similar revenue size, market capitalization, brand value, products, or markets, or with which we compete for executive talent, or which are aligned with our evolving business and talent strategies) to provide a reference for assessing executive compensation levels and practices. Based on the criteria, the following peer group was considered for purposes of setting fiscal 2024 executive compensation: American Express Company Microsoft Corporation Salesforce, Inc. Best Buy Company, Inc. Mondelez International, Inc. Starbucks Corporation The Coca-Cola Company Netflix, Inc. Target Corporation Kimberly-Clark Corporation Oracle Corporation TJX Companies Lowe's Companies, Inc. Pepsico, Inc. Walmart Inc. McDonald's Corporation Procter & Gamble Company The Walt Disney Company In November 2023, the Compensation Committee further refined the peer group for purposes of setting fiscal 2025 executive compensation to include Cisco Systems, Inc. and to remove American Express Company and Oracle Corporation. In addition to considering our peer group, the Compensation Committee also uses market survey data from third parties, including Aon, Willis Towers Watson, and Mercer, about a broader range of companies. The Compensation Committee generally does not set executive compensation at or near any particular percentile of peer group, or market, compensation. Instead, the committee considers compensation to be competitive if it is generally within a reasonable range of market median. 39 NIKE, INC. ROLE OF MANAGEMENT The CEO makes compensation recommendations to, and participates in discussions with, the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation of each executive officer other than himself. In addition, our human resources staff regularly provides data, analysis, and recommendations to the committee regarding executive compensation. The Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive session without the CEO or other management present to discuss our executive compensation program. Such executive sessions include discussions about, among other topics, the CEO's performance and compensation and the design and operation of our executive compensation plans. ROLE OF COMPENSATION CONSULTANT The Compensation Committee has the authority, in its sole discretion, to retain compensation consultants to assist the committee in overseeing our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee chose not to retain any such consultants in fiscal 2024. However, in connection with the committee's analysis and decision-making regarding the fiscal 2024 executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee supplemented peer group data with information from surveys and reports containing competitive market data from Aon, Willis Towers Watson, and Mercer, which are obtained by our human resources staff. OTHER COMPENSATION PRACTICES STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES We maintain stock ownership guidelines for executive officers that are designed to further align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders. Under the guidelines, each executive officer is required to hold NIKE stock valued at the following multiple of their annual base salary: POSITION OWNERSHIP LEVEL Chief Executive Officer 8X Base Salary Other Executive Officers (including NEOs) 3X Base Salary New executive officers are required to attain these ownership levels within five years of their appointment. For purposes of calculating ownership, we exclude unvested PSUs as well as all stock options (whether vested or unvested). As of May 31, 2024, the CEO and each of our other executive officers, including each other Named Executive Officer, has met or is on track to meet the applicable ownership guideline within the requisite period. HEDGING AND PLEDGING The Company's Blackout and Pre-clearance Policy (which supplements our Insider Trading Policy) prohibits directors, executive officers, and other designated insiders (based on seniority and department) from engaging in transactions involving hedging, monetization, or short sales of NIKE stock, including zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts. The policy also requires directors and executive officers, along with members of their families and households, to obtain pre-approval from the Company's Chairman or CEO before pledging NIKE stock. Before any such approval is granted, the Company's Clearance Director considers the size of the pledge relative to the individual's other holdings, both direct and indirect, and NIKE's shares outstanding; the risk of foreclosure given the nature of the associated transaction; protections against the appearance of insider trading, including prohibitions on sales during trading blackouts; and the ability to timely report sales on Form 4. CHANGE-IN-CONTROL PROVISIONS PSP awards do not accelerate upon a change in control. PSU, stock option, and RSU awards are subject only to "double-trigger" accelerated change-in-control vesting (with PSUs vesting at 100% of target), meaning that vesting is accelerated only if there is a change in control of the Company, and within the following two years, either the acquiring entity fails to assume the awards or the employee's employment is terminated by the acquirer without cause or by the employee for good reason. This double-trigger acceleration is intended to encourage executive retention through a period of uncertainty. The Compensation Committee believes that this approach will enhance shareholder value in the context of an acquisition and align executives' interests with those of investors. The effect of change-in-control transactions on stock-based awards is described further in the section below titled "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control". 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 40 CLAWBACK In December 2023, the Company adopted a revised clawback policy regarding accounting restatements in connection with the SEC's adoption of new rules to implement Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and corresponding NYSE listing standards. The clawback policy generally requires recoupment of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation (including any compensation granted, earned, or vested wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure) received by current and former executive officers (as defined in Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act), including our NEOs, during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the Company's material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. federal securities laws. In addition to the clawback policy, the Company maintains clawback provisions in the PSP and all of our equity award agreements (including all time-vesting equity awards) that generally permit recoupment in the event of the recipient's theft, embezzlement, fraud, breach of confidentiality or other applicable restrictive covenants, or material breach of contract. RISK ASSESSMENT At the Compensation Committee's request, management prepared an assessment of potential risks associated with the Company's fiscal 2024 compensation programs, including any risk that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. This included an assessment of risks associated with each element of executive compensation. The assessment considered certain design features of the compensation program that reduce the likelihood of excessive risk taking, such as reasonable performance targets, capped incentive compensation payouts, a balance of short- and long-term incentives, a balance of cash- and stock-based incentives, vesting of awards over time, and the potential for clawback of incentive compensation. In addition, for stock-based compensation, we have adopted stock ownership guidelines, provided for limited accelerated vesting of PSUs, stock options, and RSUs upon termination of employment, and provided for only double-trigger accelerated vesting of stock-based awards upon a change in control. The Compensation Committee reviewed the risk assessment and concluded that our compensation programs and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally places a $1 million limit on the amount of compensation a company can deduct in any one year for "covered employees". While the Compensation Committee seeks to preserve tax deductibility in developing and implementing our executive compensation program, the committee also believes that it is important to maintain flexibility in administering compensation programs in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals and the interests of our shareholders. Accordingly, we have not adopted a policy that all compensation must qualify as deductible for tax purposes and retain the ability to provide compensation that may not qualify as deductible under Section 162(m). COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K. Based on the review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement. Members of the Compensation Committee: • Timothy Cook, Chair • Cathleen Benko • Mónica Gil 41 NIKE, INC.

(2) For fiscal 2022, represents annual cash incentive awards under our PSP which were paid at 0% for Mr. Donahoe and 80% for Mr. Friend and Ms. O'Neill. Mr. Parker did not receive a fiscal 2022 PSP award. (3) Represents the grant date fair value of RSU and PSU awards, in each case computed in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to stock-based compensation. For RSUs, the grant date fair value was computed based on the closing market price of our Class B Stock on the grant date. For PSUs, the grant date fair value was computed using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. The assumptions made in determining the grant date fair value of PSUs under applicable accounting guidance are disclosed in footnote 5 of "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2024". For fiscal 2024, the grant date fair value of the PSU awards was: $9,515,014 for Mr. Donahoe and $4,006,367 for Messrs. Friend and Williams and Ms. O'Neill. Assuming that the maximum level of performance conditions is achieved, the PSU award values would be: $19,239,303 for Mr. Donahoe and $8,100,851 for Messrs. Friend and Williams and Ms. O'Neill. Mr. Parker's long-term incentive award for each fiscal year was delivered 100% in stock options. (4) Represents the grant date fair value of options granted in the applicable fiscal year computed in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to stock-based compensation. The grant date fair value of the options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions made in determining the grant date fair value of options under applicable accounting guidance are disclosed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024.

(6) For fiscal 2024, includes Company matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan in the amount of $16,500 for each of the Named Executive Officers. The amount for Mr. Donahoe also includes $6,280,000 in charitable matching contributions made by the Company, $123,026 in aggregate incremental cost to the Company for personal use of the Company's aircraft, as well as the value of security services and Company-related merchandise. The amount for Mr. Parker also includes $4,760,000 in charitable matching contributions made by the Company, $160,052 in aggregate incremental cost to the Company for personal use of the Company' aircraft, $33,400 in security services, as well as the value of Company-related merchandise. The aggregate incremental cost for personal use of the Company's aircraft is determined based on the variable operating cost to the Company, including the cost of fuel, maintenance, crew travel expenses, landing fees, parking fees, in-flight food and beverage, and other smaller variable costs associated with each flight. The amounts for Mr. Donahoe and Mr. Parker exclude the aggregate incremental cost to the Company for personal use of the Company's aircraft for which Mr. Donahoe or Mr. Parker, as applicable, reimbursed the Company in accordance with a time sharing agreement and as allowed under Federal Aviation Regulation 91.501(c) and (d). 43 NIKE, INC.

Under this plan, the Compensation Committee approved target awards for fiscal 2024 based on a percentage of the executive's salary as follows: Mr. Donahoe, 200%; Mr. Friend, 120%; Ms. O'Neill, 120%; Mr. Parker, 0%; and Mr. Williams, 120%. Fiscal 2024 PSP awards were eligible to be earned between 0% and 200% of target based on Company performance on two equally-weighted metrics—Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted EBIT—during fiscal 2024. Actual award payouts earned in fiscal 2024 and paid in fiscal 2025 are shown in the Summary Compensation Table. (2) These amounts represent grants of PSUs under the SIP which are eligible to be earned between 0% and 200% of target based on Relative TSR for fiscal 2024 – 2026, subject to a cap of 100% of target if Absolute TSR for the performance period is negative. If Relative TSR is at or above the threshold performance goal, the Compensation Committee may adjust the earnout upwards or downwards by up to 20 percentage points based on a holistic assessment of the Company's performance during the three-year performance period with respect to employee engagement and inclusion, representation of diverse individuals in leadership positions, and sustainability. Earned PSUs will vest in August 2026 and are generally subject to continued employment through the vesting date. Vesting will be accelerated in certain circumstances as described in the section below titled "Potential Payouts Upon Termination or Change-in-Control". The PSUs accumulate cash dividend equivalents that are paid only when, and to the extent, they vest. (3) Amounts reported in this column represent grants of RSUs under the SIP which vest in three equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Vesting will be accelerated in certain circumstances as described in the section below titled "Potential Payouts Upon Termination or Change-in-Control". The RSUs accumulate cash dividend equivalents that are only paid upon vesting. (4) Amounts reported in this column represent stock options granted under the SIP which become exercisable in four equal installments on the first four anniversaries of the grant date. Options become exercisable in certain circumstances as described in the section below titled "Potential Payouts Upon Termination or Change-in-Control". Each option has a maximum term of 10 years, subject to earlier termination in the event of the optionee's termination of employment. (5) For stock awards, represents the grant date fair value of (a) RSUs based on the closing market price of our Class B Stock on the grant date and (b) PSUs based on a value of $108.21 per share computed using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. The Monte Carlo simulation was performed using the remaining performance period of 2.83 years and assuming an expected volatility of 32.61% and risk-free interest rate of 4.50%. The expected volatility was based on an analysis of the historical volatility of the Class B Stock on the grant date for 2.83 years. The risk-free interest rate corresponding with the remaining performance period was calculated using the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rates in effect on the grant date for a 2- and 3-year period. For option awards, represents the grant date fair value of stock options granted based on a value of $34.79 per share, calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions made in determining option values are disclosed in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024. Stock and option award values were computed in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to stock-based compensation. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 44 OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT MAY 31, 2024 The following table sets forth information concerning outstanding stock options, PSUs, and RSUs held by the Named Executive Officers at May 31, 2024.

Of the amounts reported in the Aggregate Balance column, the following amounts have been reported in the Summary Compensation Tables in this proxy statement or in prior year proxy statements: Mr. Donahoe, $63,695; Mr. Friend, $9,503; Ms. O'Neill, $1,660,906; Mr. Parker, $22,435,929; and Mr. Williams, $816,365. NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in our Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP"). Participants in the DCP may elect in advance to defer up to 75 percent of their annual base salary, and up to 100 percent of their bonus. We may make annual profit sharing contributions to defined contribution retirement plans. The contributions are allocated among eligible employees based on a percentage of their total salary and bonus for the year. To the fullest extent permitted under Internal Revenue Code limitations, these contributions are made to employees' accounts under our qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan. Contributions based on salary and bonus in excess of the tax law limit ($330,000 for fiscal 2024) are made as NIKE contributions under the DCP. Amounts deferred under the DCP are credited to a participant's account under the DCP. Each participant may allocate his or her account among any combination of the investment options available under the DCP. Participants' accounts are adjusted to reflect the investment performance of the investment options selected by the participants. Participants can change the allocation of their account balances daily. The investment options available under the DCP consist of 18 mutual funds with a variety of investment objectives and five risk-based portfolios. The investment options had annual returns in fiscal 2024 ranging from -5% to 11%. Amounts credited to participants' accounts are invested by us in actual investments matching the investment options selected by the participants to ensure that we do not bear any investment risk related to participants' investment choices. The portion of a participant's account attributable to elective deferrals, including investment returns, is fully vested at all times. The portion of a participant's account attributable to NIKE contributions, including investment returns, is fully vested after the participant has been employed by us for five years. All of the Named Executive Officers are fully vested in their NIKE contributions. Each time they elect to defer compensation, participants make an election regarding distribution of the compensation deferred under the election (as adjusted to reflect investment performance). A participant may elect for distribution to be made in a lump sum at the beginning of a predetermined year while the participant is still employed or in service (but no sooner than the fourth year after the year in which the distribution election is submitted). Alternatively, a participant may elect for distribution to be made in a lump sum or in quarterly installments over five, ten or fifteen years after termination of employment or service. Participants have limited rights to change their distribution elections. Participants may make a hardship withdrawal under certain circumstances. Subject to certain limitations, a participant may also at any time request to withdraw amounts from his or her account balance that were vested as of December 31, 2004 (and any subsequent investment returns on such amount). If such request is approved, the participant may withdraw 90% of the amount requested, and the remaining 10% will be permanently forfeited. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 48 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE-IN-CONTROL CHANGE-IN-CONTROL COMPENSATION — ACCELERATION OF EQUITY AWARDS All unvested stock option, RSU, and PSU awards are subject to accelerated vesting upon the occurrence of two events (a "double-trigger"): there is a "change-in-control"; and the Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated by us without "cause" or by the Named Executive Officer for "good reason", in each case between the change-in-control (or shareholder approval of the change-in-control, if earlier) and the second anniversary of the change-in-control. Stock options will be exercisable for four years following termination of employment, but not beyond each option's original 10-year term. PSUs will vest at 100% of target. Accelerated vesting of stock options, RSUs, and PSUs will also occur if we are acquired and the acquiring company does not assume the outstanding options, RSUs, or PSUs. For purposes of our stock awards, "change-in-control" is generally defined to include: • the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of our outstanding Class A Stock or, if the Class A Stock no longer elects a majority of directors, the acquisition by any person of 30% or more of our total outstanding Common Stock; • the nomination (and subsequent election) in a two-year period of a majority of our directors by persons other than the incumbent directors; • a sale of all or substantially all of our assets; and • an acquisition of NIKE through a merger, consolidation, or share exchange. For purposes of our equity awards in connection with a change-in-control, "cause" generally includes willful and continued failure to substantially perform assigned duties and willful engagement in illegal conduct materially injurious to us, and "good reason" generally includes a material diminution in position or duties, a salary reduction or material reduction in other benefits, and a home office relocation of over 50 miles. The following table shows the estimated benefits that would have been received by the Named Executive Officers if double-trigger accelerated vesting had occurred on May 31, 2024, when the closing price of our Class B Stock was $95.05 per share. NAME STOCK AWARD ACCELERATION (1) STOCK OPTION ACCELERATION (2) TOTAL John Donahoe II $23,227,654 — $23,227,654 Matthew Friend $9,414,321 — $9,414,321 Heidi O'Neill $9,453,292 — $9,453,292 Mark Parker — — — Craig Williams $10,364,062 — $10,364,062 (1) Information regarding unvested RSUs and PSUs held by each Named Executive Officer is set forth in the Outstanding Equity Awards table above. The amounts in the table above represent the number of unvested RSUs and PSUs (at 100% of target) multiplied by the closing price of our Class B Stock on May 31, 2024. (2) Information regarding outstanding unvested stock options held by each Named Executive Officer is set forth in the Outstanding Equity Awards table above. No amounts are shown in the table above because those unvested stock options are all underwater at the per share closing price of our Class B Stock on May 31, 2024. BENEFITS TRIGGERED ON CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT TERMINATIONS STOCK OPTION ACCELERATION AND EXTENSION As of May 31, 2024, each Named Executive Officer held stock options as listed in the Outstanding Equity Awards table above. Under the terms of the stock options held by each Named Executive Officer, upon the death or disability of the holder (or with respect to Mr. Donahoe's performance-based stock options, his termination without "cause"), all unvested options will vest and will be exercisable for four years following termination of employment, but not beyond each option's original 10-year term. If death or disability of a Named Executive Officer had occurred on May 31, 2024, the aggregate value of those options is as set forth in the "Stock Option Acceleration" column of the Change-in-Control Compensation – Acceleration of Equity Awards table above. Under the terms of the stock options held by each Named Executive Officer that were granted after fiscal 2020, upon a termination of employment due to a "divestiture" or "reduction in force" that occurs at least six months following the grant date, and subject to the holder signing a general waiver and release of claims, options that are scheduled to vest within one year following the termination will vest and all vested options will be exercisable for one year following termination of employment, but not beyond each option's original 10-year term. The value of the unvested stock options held by each Named Executive Officer as of May 31, 2024 that would have become vested if a termination due to a "divestiture" or "reduction in force" had occurred on that date is $0 for each Named Executive Officer. 49 NIKE, INC. Under the terms of the stock options held by the Named Executive Officers, options that have been outstanding for at least one year will be subject to continued vesting if the holder retires after reaching age 55 with at least 5 years of service (or accelerated vesting if the holder retires after reaching age 60 with at least 5 years of service), and vested options will be exercisable for four years following termination of employment, but not beyond each option's original 10-year term. The value of the unvested stock options held by each Named Executive Officer as of May 31, 2024 that would have continued to vest (or received accelerated vesting) if the NEO had retired on that date is $0 for each Named Executive Officer. Mr. Friend is not eligible for retirement vesting because he has not reached age 55. STOCK AWARD ACCELERATION As of May 31, 2024, the Named Executive Officers held unvested RSUs and PSUs as set forth in the Outstanding Equity Awards table above. Under the terms of their award agreements, all unvested RSUs (excluding a transition award granted to Mr. Williams) and PSUs will immediately vest upon the death or disability of the holder, with PSUs vesting at 100% of target. The value of the unvested RSUs and PSUs held by each Named Executive Officer as of May 31, 2024 that would have become vested if death or disability had occurred on that date is as set forth in the "Stock Award Acceleration" column of the Change-in-Control Compensation — Acceleration of Equity Awards table above. Under the terms of the RSUs that were granted to the Named Executive Officers after fiscal 2020 (excluding stock-based transition awards granted to Messrs. Friend and Williams and Ms. O'Neill) and all PSUs held by the Named Executive Officers, upon a termination of employment due to a "divestiture" or "reduction in force" that occurs at least six months following the grant date, and subject to the holder signing a general waiver and release of claims, RSUs and PSUs that are scheduled to vest within one year following the termination will vest, with PSUs vesting at 100% of target. The value of the unvested RSUs and PSUs held by each Named Executive Officer as of May 31, 2024 that would have become vested if a termination due to a "divestiture" or "reduction in force" had occurred on that date is $5,406,729 for Mr. Donahoe, $1,583,438 for Mr. Friend, $1,622,409 for Ms. O’Neill, $0 for Mr. Parker, and $1,094,596 for Mr. Williams. PAYMENTS UNDER NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENTS We have a noncompetition agreement with Mr. Donahoe that extends for 18 months following the termination of his employment with us and a noncompetition agreement with Mr. Parker that extends for two years following the termination of his employment with us. Under these agreements, if Mr. Donahoe's employment is terminated by us without "cause" (as defined in his agreement), or if Mr. Parker's employment is terminated by us, we will make monthly payments to the executive during the noncompetition period in an amount equal to one-twelfth of his then current annual salary and target PSP award ("Annual NIKE Income"). The agreements provide further that if the executive voluntarily resigns, we will make monthly payments to him during the noncompetition period in an amount equal to one-twenty-fourth of his then current Annual NIKE Income. However, commencement of the above-described monthly payments will be delayed until after the six-month period following the executive's separation from service, and all payments that he would otherwise have received during that period will be paid in a lump sum promptly following the end of the period, together with interest at the prime rate. If employment is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the applicable agreement), the parties may mutually agree to waive the covenant not to compete, and if employment is terminated for "cause", we may unilaterally waive the covenant. If the covenant is waived, we will not be required to make the payments described above for the months as to which the waiver applies. Assuming that Mr. Donahoe's employment had been terminated on May 31, 2024 and the covenant was not waived, during the 18-month period ending November 30, 2025 we would have been required to pay Mr. Donahoe $375,000 per month if the termination was by us without "cause", or $187,500 per month if he had voluntarily resigned. Assuming that Mr. Parker's employment had been terminated on May 31, 2024 and the covenant was not waived, during the 24-month period ending May 31, 2026 we would have been required to pay Mr. Parker $83,333 per month if the termination was by us, or $41,667 per month if he had voluntarily resigned. We have noncompetition agreements with each of the other Named Executive Officers on generally the same terms as Mr. Donahoe, except that the noncompetition period is one year, we may unilaterally waive the covenant in all cases (including a termination without "cause"), the monthly payments are one-twelfth or one-twenty-fourth of the executive's then current annual salary (instead of their Annual NIKE Income), and payments may commence on termination. Assuming that the employment of each of these Named Executive Officers had been terminated by us without "cause" on May 31, 2024 and the covenants were not waived, we would have been required to pay $104,167 to each of Messrs. Friend and Williams and Ms. O'Neill on a monthly basis for the 12-month period ending May 31, 2025. Assuming that each of these Named Executive Officers had voluntarily resigned on May 31, 2024 and the covenants were not waived, we would have been required to pay $52,083 to each of Messrs. Friend and Williams and Ms. O'Neill on a monthly basis for the 12-month period ending May 31, 2025. CEO PAY RATIO NIKE's pay and benefits are designed to be competitive and equitable, meet the diverse needs of our global teammates, and reinforce our values. We pay for performance and impact by linking incentive pay to Company performance and seek to invest in positive experiences that have the greatest impact on the engagement and well-being of our employees. The executive 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 50 compensation program is highly incentive-based and weighted towards long-term awards to emphasize long-term performance and support retention. Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain top-tier talent in a competitive market and to "pay for performance" in order to drive business results and maximize shareholder value. For fiscal 2024, our last completed fiscal year: • The employee identified at the median of all NIKE employees (other than our CEO) was a retail store employee in Canada; • The annual total compensation of the median employee was $38,462; • The annual total compensation of our CEO, Mr. Donahoe, was $29,184,701; and • The estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median annual total compensation of all other NIKE employees was 759 to 1. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on the methodology described below. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, apply certain exclusions, and make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. METHODOLOGY For purposes of calculating this pay ratio, we used the same median employee that was identified in fiscal 2022, as we believe there has been no change in our employee population, our compensation arrangements, or our median employee's circumstances that would significantly affect our pay ratio disclosure. The determination of the median employee was made in fiscal 2022 using the methodology described below, and the median employee's fiscal 2024 annual total compensation was calculated based on the Summary Compensation Table rules used for our Named Executive Officers (in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K). FISCAL 2022 METHODOLOGY We use the first business day in May as the date to determine the median employee. The first business day in May for fiscal 2022 was May 2, 2022. At that time, we had approximately 77,239 employees globally. After applying the "de minimis exemption" under the SEC rules, which permits us to exclude non-U.S. employees accounting for 5% or less of our total employee population, we excluded the 3,656 employees in the jurisdictions identified below, and our employee population consisted of approximately 73,583 employees. Slovenia 1 Denmark 68 Malaysia 206 Sri Lanka 4 Uruguay 71 Thailand 206 United Arab Emirates 5 Czech Republic 73 South Africa 207 Croatia 6 Hungary 82 Vietnam 252 Philippines 19 Indonesia 85 Israel 266 Macau 42 Ireland 87 Poland 276 New Zealand 44 Switzerland 113 Chile 285 Norway 45 Greece 135 Hong Kong 323 Sweden 55 Portugal 148 Turkey 340 Brazil 61 Austria 151 Of the 73,583 employees included in the CEO Pay Ratio calculation, approximately 75% were full-time, 49% were in retail jobs, and 51% were located in the United States. To identify our median employee we calculated annual compensation for fiscal 2022 based on base salary or hourly wages, as applicable. For the majority of our employees, base salary or hourly wages comprise the majority of their compensation. To determine wages for hourly employees, we used each individual's pay rate and estimated scheduled hours in the applicable Human Resources system of record. After determining the annual compensation for our employee population as described above, we identified a subset of approximately 100 individuals representing the potential median employee population. For this subset, we calculated each employee's annual total compensation in U.S. dollars for fiscal 2022 based on the Summary Compensation Table rules used for our Named Executive Officers (in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K). Compensation for permanent employees hired during the fiscal year was annualized, compensation for non-U.S. employees was converted into U.S. dollars using the 51 NIKE, INC. applicable currency conversion rate as reported in the Human Resources system of record for the median employee determination date, and the median employee was then selected from this subset. PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE This disclosure has been prepared in accordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act and does not necessarily reflect how the Compensation Committee evaluates compensation decisions in light of Company or individual performance. The Compensation Committee did not consider the pay versus performance disclosure below in making its compensation decisions for any of the fiscal years shown. For discussion of how the Compensation Committee seeks to align pay with performance when making compensation decisions, please review the section above titled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis".

The Audit & Finance Committee directly oversees the firm's work with respect to the annual audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and approves all audit engagement fees and terms. At least annually, the Audit & Finance Committee evaluates the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, performance, and independence, including a review and evaluation of its lead partner. The Audit & Finance Committee is also involved in the selection of the new lead engagement partner following mandated rotation of the firm’s lead partner, and is responsible for considering the benefits of rotation of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit & Finance Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025 and to render other professional services as required. PwC has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for many years. The Audit & Finance Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of PwC as the independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Audit & Finance Committee is submitting the appointment of PwC to shareholders for ratification. If the appointment is not ratified by our shareholders, the Audit & Finance Committee may reconsider whether it should appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. Representatives of PwC will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to questions. Aggregate fees billed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, PwC, for audit services related to the most recent two fiscal years, and for other professional services incurred in the most recent two fiscal years, were as follows: TYPE OF SERVICE 2024 2023 Audit Fees (1) $20.2 million $18.7 million Audit-Related Fees (2) 0.5 million 0.3 million Tax Fees (3) 0.1 million 0.2 million All Other Fees (4) 1.4 million 0.8 million Total $22.2 million $20.0 million (1) Comprises the audits of the Company's annual financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting, and reviews of the Company's quarterly financial statements, as well as statutory audits of Company subsidiaries, attest services, and consents to SEC filings. (2) Comprises services including consultations regarding financial accounting and reporting. (3) Comprises services for tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice. Tax compliance includes services for compliance related tax advice, as well as the preparation and review of both original and amended tax returns for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Tax fees for fiscal 2024 primarily consist of fees related to tax planning. Tax fees for fiscal 2023 primarily consist of fees related to tax compliance. (4) Comprises other miscellaneous services. In accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Audit & Finance Committee established policies and procedures under which all audit and non-audit services performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm must be approved in advance by the Audit & Finance Committee. During fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, all such services performed by, and fees paid to, PwC were approved in advance. BOARD RECOMMENDATION The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote FOR ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025. 55 NIKE, INC. REPORT OF THE AUDIT & FINANCE COMMITTEE The Audit & Finance Committee has: • Reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management. • Discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and the SEC. • Received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountants required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountants' communications concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence. • Based on the review and discussions above, recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the last fiscal year for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Members of the Audit & Finance Committee: • Alan Graf, Jr., Chair • Maria Henry • Peter Henry • Robert Swan 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 56 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS PROPOSAL 4 TO CONSIDER A SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING SUPPLEMENTAL PAY EQUITY DISCLOSURE The following shareholder proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent. Robert and Mary McInnes, c/o Arjuna Capital, 13 Elm Street, Manchester, MA 01944, beneficial owners of at least $25,000 of Class B Stock, submitted the Proposal. The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal and asks shareholders to read through NIKE's response which follows the shareholder proposal. Racial and Gender Pay Gaps Whereas: Pay inequities persist across race and gender and pose substantial risk to companies and society at large. Black workers' hourly median earnings represent 81 percent of white wages. The median income for women working full time is 84 percent that of men. Intersecting race, Black women earn 73 cents and Latina women 65 cents. At the current rate, women will not reach pay equity until 2059, Black women until 2130, and Latina women until 2224. Citigroup estimates closing minority and gender wage gaps 20 years ago could have generated 12 trillion dollars in additional income. PwC estimates closing the gender pay gap could boost Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries’ economies by 2 trillion dollars annually. Actively managing pay equity is associated with improved representation, and diversity is linked to superior stock performance and return on equity. Minorities represent 41 percent of Nike’s workforce and 34 percent of leadership. Women represent 51 percent of Nike's workforce and 44 percent of leadership. 1 Best practice pay equity reporting consists of two parts: 1. unadjusted median pay gaps, assessing equal opportunity to high paying roles, 2. statistically adjusted gaps, assessing pay between minorities and non-minorities, men and women, performing similar roles. Nike reports only statistically adjusted gaps but ignores unadjusted gaps, which address structural bias women and minorities face regarding job opportunity and pay, particularly when men hold most higher paying jobs. Median pay gaps show, quite literally, how Nike assigns value to employees through the roles they inhabit and pay they receive. Median gap reporting also provides a digestible and comparable data point to determine progress over time. Racial and gender median pay gaps are accepted as the valid way of measuring pay inequity by the United States Census Bureau, Department of Labor, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and International Labor Organization. The United Kingdom and Ireland mandate disclosure of median gender pay gaps. Nike discloses data for United Kingdom employees, reporting a median hourly gender pay gap of 5 percent and median bonus gap of 11 percent. 2 Resolved: Shareholders request Nike report on median pay gaps across race and gender, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining diverse talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information. Racial/gender pay gaps are defined as the difference between non-minority and minority/male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of non-minority/male earnings (Wikipedia/OECD, respectively). Supporting Statement: An annual report adequate for investors to assess performance could, with board discretion, integrate base, bonus and equity compensation to calculate: • percentage median gender pay gap, globally and/or by country, where appropriate • percentage median racial/minority/ethnicity pay gap, US and/or by country, where appropriate 1 https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/releases/fy23-nike-inc-impact-report 2 https://web.archive.org/web/20230314160211/https://media.about.nike.com/files/82af3407-4e4b-4b03-b704-43f54970f481/FY21_UK-Gender-Pay-Gap.pdf 57 NIKE, INC. OPPOSITION STATEMENT The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal because: • The Company remains committed to the principle of equal pay for equal work and to enhancing the representation of diverse individuals at all levels of the Company; and • The Company's current initiatives and public disclosures provide our shareholders with more relevant information about the Company’s commitment to pay equity and increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion at all levels of the Company than the requested measure. We remain committed to maintaining pay equity, increasing diversity and inclusivity at all levels of the Company, and providing transparency. The Company is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture by focusing on representation, education, development, and community. We believe that diversity is a key component of innovation and strive to build a creative and inclusive environment, where all voices are welcomed and heard. As part of this commitment, we maintain robust policies and programs to advance our diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DEI") goals throughout the Company, including ensuring we continue to provide equitable and competitive pay, maintain a diverse breadth of talent in our pipeline, and develop and support our female and U.S. racial and ethnic minority employees. For example, the Company annually discloses our pay equity ratio in our annual Impact Report, which reflects our commitment to deliver equal pay for equal work. The Company defines pay equity as equal compensation for employees across gender, race, and ethnicity, who undertake the same work at the same career level, location, experience, and performance. The Company has achieved and maintained 100% pay equity across all employee levels on an annual basis. This includes a pay equity ratio of 1:1 achievement for women and U.S. racial and ethnic minorities from 2020 through 2023. We also continuously monitor, review and enhance our internal pay infrastructure through our Competitive Pay Management initiative, pursuant to which the Company, with the assistance of an independent third party, annually reviews our compensation and promotion practices across all geographies, functions, and business units to ensure the Company continues to provide competitive and equitable pay. Complementing our commitment to maintaining pay equity, we prioritize increasing gender and racial diversity at all levels of the Company, including among the Company's leadership. Our annual Impact Report includes specific representation-related targets, including achieving 50% representation of women in the global corporate workforce and 45% in leadership positions, as well as 35% representation of racial and ethnic minorities in our U.S. workforce and 30% representation of racial and ethnic minorities at the director level and above and above in the U.S., and it provides transparent workforce data that enables our shareholders to track the progress we have made over time in advancing diversity and achieving our targets. As of 2023, we have already achieved many diversity targets. For the second year in a row, the Company surpassed our target of achieving 50% representation of women in the global workforce, and women hold 44% of the positions at the VP level and above globally. Racial and ethnic minorities make up 41% of our U.S. workforce and hold 34% of positions at the director level and above in the U.S. DEI principles are also integrated into the entire Talent agenda from the very beginning of our employees' experience, with measurement and leadership accountability throughout each employee's career. The Company provides DEI education/trainings, mentorship programs and resources to all employees, with the goal of supporting career growth, building diverse and inclusive teams, and fostering awareness and understanding. While we have made strides in DEI, we recognize there is more to do. We have continued to expand our recruitment, development, and retention programs for diverse talent, including bolstering traditional executive and campus recruitment and strengthening our relationships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities ("HBCUs") and Hispanic-Serving Institutions ("HSIs"). The Company continues to work toward our 2025 target of investing $10 million over five years in HBCUs and HSIs in the form of scholarships and academic partnerships, investing $2.95 million in scholarship programs in 2023 alone. Innovative initiatives, such as the Serena Design Crew and Women in Nike programs, help to further build our pipeline of exceptional and diverse candidates, enhancing our commitment to DEI. More information about our key initiatives and diversity metrics is available in the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion section of our website and in our annual Impact Report and EEO-1 Data Report, both of which are available through the Impact section of our website. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 58 Our commitment to transparency in our current disclosures provides shareholders with meaningful information about our pay infrastructure and DEI goals and initiatives, and the requested median pay gap measure would not provide additional value. As described above, we provide comprehensive information and data about our pay infrastructure, pay equity and workforce diversity on our website and in our annual Impact Report. We believe that a commitment to transparency helps to build trust with our shareholders and internal and external stakeholders and holds us accountable to our commitments, which is why we continue to provide such information to our shareholders. In contrast, the median pay gap measure seeks to compare the pay of two employees whose compensation happens to fall at the midpoint of the pay range among those employees sharing the relevant gender, racial, or ethnic characteristic, without adjusting for relevant factors that can explain differences in pay, such as their different role, skills, performance, experience, tenure, or location. Although the Proposal is aimed at providing transparency with respect to pay equity and equal opportunity, this statistic does not demonstrate whether our women and racial and ethnic minority employees are being paid fairly for the roles that they are doing, nor does it accurately depict female or racial and ethnic representation at the Company's different locations around the globe. Our shareholders would not benefit from a surrogate measurement of pay equity that ultimately does not provide any meaningful supplemental information to our existing disclosures. Our shareholders seem to agree since similar proposals received from the proponent in 2021 and 2023 received the support of only approximately 18% and 30% of votes cast, respectively. In summary, the Board of Directors believes the Proposal is unnecessary because the Company already publicly discloses information and data with respect to our pay equity, DEI initiatives and workforce diversity that provides our shareholders with more meaningful insight into our policies and progress in this area than the unadjusted median pay gap disclosure requested by the Proposal would. BOARD RECOMMENDATION X The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 59 NIKE, INC. PROPOSAL 5 TO CONSIDER A SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING A SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT REPORT The following shareholder proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent. Tulipshare Ltd., c/o Tulipshare Capital LLC, 251 Little Falls Dr., Wilmington, DE 19808, beneficial owner of at least $25,000 of Class B Stock, submitted the Proposal. The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal and asks shareholders to read through NIKE's response which follows the shareholder proposal. RESOLVED: Shareholders of Nike, Inc. ("Nike") request that the Board oversee and issue a report to shareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, assessing the effectiveness of its existing supply chain management infrastructure in ensuring alignment with Nike's equity goals and human rights commitments. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: In the Board's discretion we recommend Nike's report include: • Assessment of whether existing policies and implementation mechanisms, such as codes, guidance and supply chain contract terms ensure alignment throughout the value chain; • Methodology and metrics to track and measure performance on forced labor and wage theft risks; • Consistency with OECD Guidelines, UN Guiding Principles, and Sustainable Development Goals; • Consideration of American Bar Association (ABA) Model Contract Clauses on human rights in the supply chain; and • Whether the assessment yields any changes to Company policies, decision making, and implementation mechanisms. WHEREAS: In the apparel industry, forced labor occurs both in the production of raw materials and during manufacturing, especially at lower tier suppliers. An estimated 27.6 million people are trapped in forced labor, with annual increases in forced labor driven entirely by the private economy. 1 UN Guiding Principles require corporate responsibility to respect human rights within operations and supply chains. Shareholders agree Nike should expand "opportunity for women" 2 considering a majority of Nike's garment workers are women 3 and the exacerbated human rights violations during the pandemic. 4 Nike's impact report includes continued support for the UN Global Compact. 5 However, Nike’s communication on progress only meets six of seventeen Sustainable Development Goals. 6 Nike has not disclosed adequate analysis regarding the efficacy of traceability steps taken to address the risks of alleged Uyghur forced labor across its supply chain tiers, nor does Nike disclose engagement with affected rightsholders or whether remedies are satisfactory to victims; KnowTheChain identified Nike policies in need of improvement: purchasing practices, worker voice, and remedy. 7 In 2022, the EU adopted a Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence in global value chains, requiring companies like Nike to identify, prevent, end or mitigate adverse impacts on human rights. 8 This Directive sets obligations, penalties and liability for large companies, with respect to their own operations, subsidiaries, and business partners. 9 In 2023, garment-worker unions and labor-rights groups filed a complaint alleging Nike's treatment of workers and unpaid wages violated OECD guidelines. 10 Nike allegedly owes an estimated $1.4 million in unpaid wages to Cambodian garment workers, 11 with Nike's overall wage theft from workers alleged at $28 million. 12 One possible approach for Nike to fulfil its responsibility to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts in its supply chain is deployment of the ABA’s Model Contract Clauses. The contract clauses are aimed at ensuring responsible purchasing practices, such as reasonable assistance to suppliers, responsible exit, and victim remedies. 13 1 https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_854733.pdf 2 https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/statements/a-letter-from-our-president-and-ceo 3 https://manufacturingmap.nikeinc.com/ 4 https://www.payyourworkers.org/ramatex 5 https://purpose-cms-preprod01.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/17210319/FY21_NIKE-Impact-Report.pdf 6 https://unglobalcompact.org/participation/report/cop/active/464879 7 https://knowthechain.org/company/nike_2021/#resources 8 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1145 9 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/01/council-adopts-position-on-due-diligence-rules-for-large-companies/ 10 https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/worker-rights-nike-oecd-complaint-covid-19-pandemic-wage-theft/; https://globallaborjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/OECD-Fact-Sheet-Nike.pdf 11 https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/cambodia-trade-unions-demand-nike-matalan-pay-garment-workers-from-closed-factory-14-million-in-unpaid-compensation-damages/ 12 https://asia.floorwage.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Money-Heist_Book_Final-compressed.pdf 13 https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/human_rights/contractual-clauses-project/mccs-full-report.pdf 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 60 OPPOSITION STATEMENT The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal because: • The Company strongly believes in, and is committed to respecting, human and labor rights through our supply chain; • The Company is continually working to facilitate world-class, safe, and healthy workplaces for the people making our products; and • The Company's policies and current disclosure effectively articulate our long-standing commitment to human rights and sustainable sourcing, rendering the Proposal unnecessary. The Company strongly believes in, and is committed to respecting, human and labor rights through our operations and supply chain. The Company is deeply committed to ethical and responsible manufacturing and to the goal that all people who make and move NIKE products are respected and valued. To inform the Company's practices, we look to the human rights defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s ("ILO") Declaration on Fundamental Rights at Work and consider the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises as best practices for understanding and managing human rights risks and impacts. Using these standards, we developed our Supplier Code of Conduct ("Supplier Code") and Code Leadership Standards ("CLS"), which are publicly available on our website and set forth minimum standards that our suppliers must comply with when producing Company products, as well as procedures for ensuring compliance with such standards. Among other things, these policies include strict requirements regarding forced and child labor, excessive overtime, compensation, and freedom of association while also requiring compliance with all local and country-specific labor laws. The Company has progressively raised our expectations for our contract factories in recent years, including by broadening the definitions of employment fees to be borne by suppliers and strengthening the oversight requirements for labor agents recruiting and hiring foreign migrant workers in the Supplier Code and CLS. In addition to updating our policies, the Company is constantly striving to enhance the impact of our practices, which is why in fiscal year 2023, the Company launched a Foreign Migrant Worker Enhanced Due Diligence program that adds a specialized approach to identify issues related to foreign migrant workers and forced labor beyond traditional labor, health, safety, and environment assessments. By the end of fiscal year 2023, we conducted enhanced due diligence assessments and remediation efforts at suppliers in countries and regions including Malaysia, Jordan, and Taiwan. As discussed in our response to Proposal 6 on page 64 of this Proxy Statement, the Company monitors supplier compliance with the Supplier Code and CLS through regular internal and external third-party audits (both announced and unannounced) and various due diligence tools, and engages in investigation and, where necessary, remediation efforts in instances of noncompliance. Should a supplier fail to remediate any issues identified, it may be subject to sanctions, including potential termination of the supplier relationship. The Company's strategic suppliers also self-diagnose and report the effectiveness of their health and safety program using the Company's Culture of Safety Maturity Assessment (CoSMA) Tool. The Company validates the results of that self-assessment through worker feedback and by a third-party administered safety perception survey. The Company takes a top-down approach to monitoring and assessing human rights-related risks. At the Board level, the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee reviews and evaluates the Company's significant strategies, activities, policies, investments, and programs regarding corporate purpose, including human rights. The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee also regularly engages with Company management to obtain appropriate information on the Company's supply chain management practices and efforts to promote human rights throughout our operations. The Company works with suppliers, industry associations, brands, civil society, and other stakeholders to facilitate world-class, safe, and healthy workplaces for the people making our products. The Company believes that addressing complex and critical human rights risks, like forced labor, requires multi-stakeholder collaboration. Leveraging information from external sources and supplier specific risks through the Company's own programs, the Company regularly evaluates and updates our systems to identify and address risks in the supply chain, including those related to forced labor. The Company continues to collaborate with industry experts, partners, industry associations, stakeholders and other organizations to understand, evaluate, and address matters related to forced labor. The Company is a founding signatory to the American Apparel and Footwear Association and the Fair Labor Association's Apparel & Footwear Commitment on Responsible Recruitment and reaffirmed our support for the Commitment in 2023. The principles of the Commitment, centered on addressing risks for forced labor, are aligned with the Company's standards and the work we have been doing with our supply chain manufacturers for more than a decade. The Company is also a member of the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, an initiative of the Institute for Human Rights and Business and is a member of the Responsible Labor Initiative, an initiative of the Responsible Business Alliance to further the Company's work and goals on eliminating forced labor risks in our supply chain. 61 NIKE, INC. The Company is committed to sharing with our stakeholders how we manage social and environmental issues and impacts. We set published goals and implement transparent policies to promote human and labor rights and the ethical production of our products, while sharing our progress and learnings along the way. The Company develops five-year targets to enhance the Company's sustainable sourcing practices, which are disclosed to shareholders, along with our annual progress towards those targets, in our annual Impact Report. Historically we have set an ambitious target of sourcing 100% from facilities that meet our foundational labor, health, safety, and environmental standards, focusing on finished goods manufacturing partners that we contract with directly.  For our 2025 targets, we expanded the scope of this target to include key materials suppliers (supplying approximately 90% of our footwear uppers and apparel materials) and focus distribution centers (representing at least 80% of volume). We have also published our Statement on Forced Labor, Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery for Fiscal Year 2023 on our website, which describes the Company's commitment to ethical and responsible manufacturing, our ongoing supplier diligence and monitoring practices to identify and assess potential forced labor risks, our processes for engaging with suppliers to prioritize the well-being of their workers, and our partnerships with various organizations to drive collaborative efforts to address critical human rights risks, such as forced labor. The Company also discloses the independent factories and materials suppliers used to manufacture the Company's products in an interactive and publicly available Nike Manufacturing Map and requires our finished goods suppliers to source materials from vendors that are compliant with the Company's Restricted Substances List, Supplier Code, and Traceability Standards. In summary, the Company remains committed to integrating respect for people and the planet throughout the Company's entire business, including our contract supply chain. We believe that our decades of commitment to these issues have led to more effective and impactful solutions, and the Company is proud to share our initiatives and policies with our shareholders. The Board of Directors believes that the Company's policies and current disclosure effectively articulate our long-standing support for, and continued commitment to, human rights and sustainable sourcing, rendering the Proposal ineffective and unnecessary. BOARD RECOMMENDATION X The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 62 PROPOSAL 6 TO CONSIDER A SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING WORKER-DRIVEN SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY The following shareholder proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent. Domini Impact Equity Fund, 180 Maiden Lane, Suite 1302, New York, NY 10038, a beneficial owner of at least $25,000 of Class B Stock, and other co-filers, submitted the Proposal. The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal and asks shareholders to read through NIKE's response which follows the shareholder proposal. RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Nike, Inc. ("Nike") publish a report evaluating how implementing worker-driven social responsibility principles and supporting binding agreements would impact the Company's ability to identify and remediate human rights issues in sourcing from high-risk countries. WHEREAS: Nike has developed extensive corporate social responsibility (CSR) systems and initiatives in response to heightened scrutiny over exploitative and unsafe conditions in its global supply chains. CSR approaches like Nike's can foster efficient supply chain-wide human rights risk assessment and oversight. However, evidence demonstrates that dominant CSR approaches, which rely heavily on social audits, often fail to identify, and remedy persistent rights abuses such as wage theft, inadequate health and safety or gender-based violence. 1 Sourcing from high-risk countries exposes Nike to increased risks of operational disruptions, legal liability, and reputational harm. CSR models face challenges in high-risk countries, where national regulation and enforcement of labor laws are inadequate or compromised, or where it is dangerous for workers or their representatives to report abuse and seek remediation. 2 For example, in spite of its existing programs, workers at Nike suppliers in Cambodia and Thailand are allegedly still owed $2.2 million in unpaid wages and benefits from 2020. 3 Worker-driven social responsibility (WSR) principles were developed to protect the rights of workers, in response to the body of evidence illustrating that CSR approaches are insufficient. 4 WSR initiatives are led by workers, include binding agreements between workers and brands, and ensure independent monitoring. WSR initiatives also support timely and effective reporting of harms through grievance mechanisms and worker participation in the design and provision of remedy. 5 WSR initiatives are aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and are effective even in contexts where workers are vulnerable to abuses and exploitation. 6 For example, Nike supplier Hansae Vietnam, which had 26 separate social audits showing no rights violations in the same year that an investigation utilizing WSR principles unveiled extensive wage theft, forced and excessive overtime, unsafe conditions and abuse. 7 Vitally, using a WSR approach to remedy enabled full remediation of these issues. Many of Nike's peers have taken steps to improve conditions for workers and remediate rights violations by employing WSR approaches or binding agreements with labor organizations, such as the International Accord and the Lesotho Agreement. 8 In contrast, Nike has not demonstrated the same level of due diligence in countries where binding agreements and WSR approaches to remedy are available and have proven to be essential in protecting vulnerable workers. Evaluation of the impact of steps that could be taken to reinforce its due diligence, such as adopting and abiding by proven WSR solutions and binding agreements, would better position Nike to understand gaps in its efforts to mitigate legal, reputational, and human rights risks in high-risk countries. 1 See e.g., Sarosh Kuruvilla, Private Regulation of Labor Standards in Global Supply Chains, Cornell University Press (2021); https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/14/supply-chain-audits-failing-detect-abuses-report 2 https://www.hrw.org/report/2022/11/21/only-instant-noodle-unions-survive/union-busting-cambodias-garment-and-tourism 3 https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/cambodia-thailand-investors-labour-rights-advocates-call-on-nike-to-pay-more-than-4000-garment-workers-unpaid-wages-of-22-million-incl-co-response/; https://www.iccr.org/joint-investor-letter-to-nike-on-outstanding-wage-payments/ 4 https://wsr-network.org/what-is-wsr/statement-of-principles 5 https://fairfoodprogram.org/; https://electronicswatch.org/new-worker-driven-remedy-principles_2635094.pdf 6 https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf; https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-01/arp-note-meeting-effectiveness-criteria.pdf 7 https://www.workersrights.org/factory-investigation/hansae-vietnam/ 8 https://internationalaccord.org/signatories/ 63 NIKE, INC. OPPOSITION STATEMENT The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal because: • The Company has a fundamental respect for human rights throughout our operations, and we expect our suppliers to share in our commitment to respecting the rights of workers and advancing their welfare; • The Company has established robust controls to identify, assess, and remediate human rights and labor issues throughout its operations and supply chain; and • The Proposal is unnecessary because the Company already shares how it identifies, assesses, and manages human rights and labor risks and impacts throughout its supply chain. The Company has established robust processes and practices to help identify, assess, and remediate human rights and labor issues throughout its operations and supply chain. The Company aims to elevate human potential through our products, partnerships, and operations, which cannot be accomplished without a fundamental respect for human rights throughout our operations and supply chain. The Company expects each of its suppliers to share in its commitment to respecting the rights of workers and advancing their welfare, with particular care for people with unique vulnerabilities such as women, migrants, and temporary workers. To that end, the Company requires each of its suppliers to comply with the minimum standards set forth in the Company's Supplier Code of Conduct ("Supplier Code") and Code Leadership Standards ("CLS") when producing Company products. These policies are aligned with international human rights standards and include strict requirements regarding forced and child labor, excessive overtime, compensation, and freedom of association, among other requirements. We regularly monitor our supply chain for compliance with these standards. For example, the Company engages in regular human rights-related due diligence, risk assessment, and monitoring efforts, which includes the use of regular internal and external third-party audits (both announced and unannounced) in order to assess supplier compliance with the Company's standards and local law, as well as the use of due diligence tools to help identify recruitment of foreign migrant workers by NIKE suppliers as part of the Company's Foreign Migrant Worker Enhanced Due Diligence Program (which is described in more detail in the Company's response to Proposal 5 on page 61 of this Proxy Statement). Suppliers are also required to inform their employees and applicable subcontractors of the Company's Speak Up Portal, which allows for the anonymous reporting of Supplier Code and CLS concerns. In the event the Company becomes aware of allegations of noncompliance with the Supplier Code or CLS, the Company investigates and takes appropriate action as needed, which may include reinforcing the Company's standards and expectations with the supplier, working with the supplier to correct the issue and identify and address root causes, and/or terminating the supplier relationship. As an industry leader, the Company also regularly seeks to improve its approach to understanding and evaluating working conditions in its supply chain and works with its suppliers to enhance their capabilities. For example, in 2017, the Company introduced the Engagement and Wellbeing ("EWB") Survey, a comprehensive, manufacturing-focused and actionable tool that enables suppliers (and the Company) to hear directly from their workers about their experiences. The EWB Survey results establish a baseline for the Company's EWB Program, which is committed to embedding capabilities within the Company's suppliers that help improve worker experience. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, the EWB Survey has been deployed at least once by all of the Company's strategic suppliers. The Company advocates for better practices and greater transparency throughout our global supply chain, which is why we share how we manage social issues and impacts with our stakeholders. The Company's website features a Responsible Sourcing page that includes its Supplier Code and CLS, as well as its Statement on Forced Labor, Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery for Fiscal Year 2023, which describes the Company's commitment to ethical and responsible manufacturing, the Company's ongoing supplier diligence and monitoring practices detailed above, how the Company engages with its suppliers to prioritize the well-being of their workers, and the Company's collaborations with various organizations to drive collaborative efforts to identify and address critical human rights risks, such as forced labor. The Responsible Sourcing page features additional resources related to the Company's responsible sourcing commitment, including details on the Company's supply chain industry collaborations, strategic compensation practices in the Company's supply chain, and the Company's Fair Labor association reaccreditation. The Company's annual Impact Report also describes the Company's approach to supply chain governance, human rights, and compliance. In sum, the Board of Directors believes that the Proposal is unnecessary because the Company's policies and disclosures effectively articulate the Company's long-standing support for, and continued commitment to, human rights and responsible sourcing, including its robust processes for identifying, assessing, and addressing human rights and labor risks and impacts throughout its supply chain. BOARD RECOMMENDATION X The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 64 PROPOSAL 7 TO CONSIDER A SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL TARGETS The following shareholder proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent. Trium Sustainable Innovators funds, 60 Gresham Street, London EC2V 7BB, UK, a beneficial owner of at least $25,000 of Class B Stock, submitted the Proposal. The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal and asks shareholders to read through NIKE's response which follows the shareholder proposal. WHEREAS: NIKE, Inc. pledged a robust sustainability agenda but fell short on most of its targets, casting doubt on its commitment and communication reliability. Trium Sustainable Innovators' investment in NIKE, Inc. is based on the expectation that it can achieve profitable growth in the long term. We recognize differing investor views on achieving this. While we acknowledge the fashion industry's negative environmental impact and associated financial risks, we respect differing perspectives. However, inconsistent strategy communication and execution serve neither investor group well. The FY20 NIKE, Inc. Impact Report indicates that only 7 of 19 targets set for FY15-20 were achieved. Several targets were missed significantly or showed no progress. Moreover, objectives were altered or discontinued when the company set out its targets for the FY20-25 period, as shown in the FY21 Impact Report. Amongst the most noteworthy failures: The target to reduce average product carbon footprint by 10% in FY15-20 saw no progress, Nike’s FY20 footprint per unit matched that of FY15. The FY21 Impact Report omits mention of the product carbon footprint, setting a less ambitious 10% waste reduction goal per unit for FY25 across manufacturing, DCs and HQs for FY25. Five energy related targets were set, including achieving 100% renewable energy in owned sites by FY20 and four energy intensity goals. Progress toward the renewable energy target reached 48% in FY20, but energy intensity targets saw minimal progress and were discontinued in the FY21 Impact Report, with the renewable energy target postponed to FY25. Three chemistry related targets (restricted substances and supplier wastewater management practices) were unmet in FY20 and discontinued in FY21 Impact Report. The current FY20-25 target focuses on "adopting clean chemistry alternatives for our 10 priority chemistries across our supply chain". NIKE, Inc.'s explanations for these failures appear to absolve itself of responsibility, attributing them to "consumer preference" and "marketplace demand". This overlooks the company’s influence on demand through pricing, supply volumes, and product visibility on its direct sales channels. We are disappointed by the firm's track record and lack of perseverance in reaching its self-imposed sustainability objectives. BE IT RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board of Directors prepare a report, at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, and published publicly within one year from the annual meeting date, and containing the following: • An analysis of NIKE, Inc's failure to meet its self-imposed quantitative sustainability targets for FY15-20, now discontinued, and whether reinstating them is advisable. • An analysis of NIKE, Inc's corporate governance around sustainability, examining the mechanisms in place to define, communicate and execute its sustainability strategy within the broader business strategy. • A discussion of the potential additional measures NIKE, Inc could implement to ensure it achieves its sustainability objectives irrespective of consumer preference and marketplace demand. 65 NIKE, INC. OPPOSITION STATEMENT The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal because: • The Company already publicly reports its year-over-year progress towards achieving its Purpose-related targets as well as its processes for developing, monitoring, and executing on those targets in the Company’s annual Impact Report; and • The Proposal would divert Company time and resources to the preparation of a report that would ultimately not provide additional value to the Company’s shareholders. The Company sets ambitious goals to advance the three pillars of the Company’s Purpose: People, Planet, and Play. The Company believes in the power of sport to move the world forward, and we recognize that as a global athletic market leader, the Company must set bold, ambitious goals to show what is possible for the greater industry. Since 2005, the Company has published five-year targets that represent multi-year commitments to drive meaningful impact, meet stakeholder expectations, and align with the Company's strategic and business priorities. Currently, the Company has adopted a set of 29 ambitious corporate targets for fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2025 across its three Purpose pillars: People, Planet, and Play, each of which is described in detail in the Company's annual Impact Report. These targets are designed to be bold but also attainable and measurable, with the goal of pushing the Company to the edges of what it can achieve in order to drive meaningful progress. While the Company is committed to working towards its 2025 targets, it’s also striving to do more. Every five years, the Company unveils new targets that reflect a continuation of its key priorities but are updated to reflect the Company's most current, evolved approach to these priorities, based on what the Company has learned, how it has grown, and how the world has evolved in understanding and addressing these issues. For each adopted target, the Company's Impact Report provides context on the defined goals and approach, details on the initiatives underway to reach the target, and updates on the results of our efforts. The Company's Impact Report provides additional context surrounding each adopted target, including the Company's goal, approach, and challenges, as well as initiatives that the Company has implemented to reach the target. The Company's publicly-available annual Impact Report already provides the information requested by the Proposal. The Company recognizes that success in this space is not linear, but that accountability means sharing both the Company's achievements and its learnings from its setbacks. As a result, the Company proudly reports its progress towards achieving each of its adopted targets in its annual Impact Report (which is available on the Company's website), including areas where the Company has succeeded, areas where the Company has faced challenges, and the steps the Company has taken/is taking to drive further progress.  The Impact Report also details the Company's approach to governance, oversight, and reporting, including the roles of management and the Board in setting goals, prioritizing issues, monitoring, and reporting progress and managing the risks and opportunities associated with the Company's Purpose. In short, the Company's Impact Report is currently designed to provide stakeholders with the key information that the Proposal seeks and the Board of Directors does not believe that diverting Company time and resources to the preparation of a separate report that would merely provide shareholders with duplicative information is in the best interests of shareholders. BOARD RECOMMENDATION X The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 66 PROPOSAL 8 TO CONSIDER A SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING A DIVISIVE PARTNERSHIPS CONGRUENCY REPORT The following shareholder proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent. National Center for Public Policy Research, 2005 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20036, a beneficial owner of at least $2,000 of Class B Stock, submitted the Proposal. The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal and asks shareholders to read through NIKE's response which follows the shareholder proposal. Supporting Statement: Nike is a leading athletic footwear and apparel company. That is its core business, and it owes a duty to shareholders to maximize the value of their investments by focusing on that core purpose and staying away from unrelated concerns, especially if they're partisan, extreme or otherwise fraught with easily avoidable risk. Nike has partnerships with and contributes to many organizations that promote highly divisive agendas such as providing minors with secret-from-parents access to puberty blockers and gender transition surgeries, evangelizing radical gender ideology to minors, and lobbying to allow males to destroy girls' and women's chances to excel in their own sports and to violate their privacy and safety 1 in restrooms and locker rooms. Proponents of radical gender ideology claim that children are sexually mature enough to make Iife-choices of permanent consequence, such as taking puberty blockers and undergoing gender transition surgeries. However, most people (and therefore most ultimate Nike investors – not the investment houses and proxy advisory services stealing their voices) don't. 2 This contentious and vast disagreement between radical gender ideologues and the public has nothing to do with Nike making and selling footwear and apparel. Yet, Nike has paid partnerships with the Human Rights Campaign 3 and the GenderCool Project 4 – organizations that promote these divisive practices. 5 Nike also has partnerships with Athlete Ally 6 and The Out Foundation 7 – organizations that, along with HRC and GenderCool, lobby for males competing in girls' and women's sports 8 despite the fact that 70% of Americans oppose it. 9 The burden of proof is on the Board to explain why these particularly divisive and unordinary uses of shareholder resources are deemed to be congruent with its fiduciary duty. Recent events have made clear that shareholder value drops when companies engage in overtly divisive activism of this sort. Following Bud Light's embrace of such partisanship, its revenue fell $395 million in North America compared to a year prior. 10 Target's market cap fell over $15 billion amid backlash for similar actions. 11 Disney stock fell 44 percent in 2022 – its worst performance in nearly 50 years – for putting divisive agendas ahead of parental rights. 12 And more recently, Planet Fitness' valuation dropped by $400 million in just five days after the company banned a female member for expressing her discomfort with a male shaving next to her in the women's locker room. 13 Considering that Nike gives shareholder assets to many organizations that advance the very agenda that caused Disney, Target, Bud Light and Planet Fitness valuations to plummet, such contributions pose a clear risk to Nike shareholders as well. Resolved: Shareholders request that the Company prepare a report, at reasonable expense and excluding proprietary information, listing and analyzing voluntary partnerships and the congruency of those partners' agendas with the Company's fiduciary duty to shareholders. 1 https://pjmedia.com/graysonbakich/2024/03/26/canadian-man-allegedly-attacks-10-year-old-girl-when-confronted-about-being-in-changing-room-n4927671; https://www.dailywire.com/news/loudoun-county-schools-tried-to-conceal-sexual-assault-against-daughter-in-bathroom-father-says 2 https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/3991685-majority-of-americans-oppose-gender-affirming-care-for-minors-trans-women-participating- in-sports-poll/ 3 https://www.hrc.org/about/corporate-partners 4 https://gendercool.org/partners-and-supporters/ 5 https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf; https://gendercool.org/todayshow 6 https://www.athleteally.org/our-supporters/ 7 https://theoutfoundation.org/partners 8 https://www.athleteally.org/about/; https://theoutfoundation.org/about; https://gendercool.org/playitout/; https://www.hrc.org/resources/get-the- facts-about-transgender-non-binary-athletes 9 https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/americans-oppose-inclusion-trans-athletes-sports-poll-finds-rcna88940 10 https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/business/anheuser-busch-revenue-bud-light-intl-hnk/index.html; 11 https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/target-market-cap-losses-hit-15-7-billion-share-near-52-week-low-amid-woke-backlash 12 https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/disney-has-lost-50-billion-in-value-since-war-with-florida-began; https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-stock-2022-1235289239/; https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/disney-stock-price-decline-bob-iger-pandemic-inflation-recession-streaming-2022-12 13 https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13220723/Planet-Fitness-Value-Falls-Trans-row.html 67 NIKE, INC. OPPOSITION STATEMENT The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal because: • The Company’s current approach to partnering with third-party organizations, along with our existing disclosures, appropriately serves the best interests of our shareholders; and • The Proposal would divert Company time and resources to the preparation of a report that would ultimately not provide additional value to the Company’s shareholders. The Company's partnerships play a key role in advancing the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Company believes that sport has the power to move the world forward, and that the Company has a role to play in creating greater access to sport for all. To that end, one of the Company's strategies is to grow its consumer base by inviting more people—including the next generation of athletes—into sport. This strategy serves as a foundation for driving long-term growth and value for the Company and our shareholders. However, the Company cannot do it alone. Our partnerships with our employees, athletes, experts, and community organizations are critical in helping the Company achieve its vision for the future of sport—where everybody is invited to play. For example, through its partnerships, the Company is removing barriers to participation for kids—especially girls—and training coaches from diverse experiences and backgrounds to become game-changing mentors who encourage all kids to play. The Company devotes considerable time and resources to making sure that its partnerships advance the Company's business goals, and has processes in place that are focused on evaluating and approving the Company's partnerships and policies. At the Board level, the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability and Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's community and social impact efforts and other corporate purpose activities, including reviewing and providing guidance to management regarding the Company's significant purpose-related activities, policies, investments, and programs and its work with industry organizations and non-governmental organizations concerning corporate responsibility. This process helps ensure that the Company's partnerships continue to support its strategy of increasing accessibility, participation, and equality in sport, which in turn fuels long-term growth for our shareholders. The Company already provides significant disclosure about the Company's partnerships and how they align with the Company's purpose and long-term value creation for shareholders. We believe it is important not only to engage with organizations and issues that are important to our business and our shareholders, but to be transparent regarding that engagement. As a result, consistent with our Policy on Public Policy and Political Contributions, the Company annually reports its political contributions to political candidates, organizations, and ballot initiatives on its website. We also provide a list of significant governmental entities, NGOs and industry groups the Company is involved with in the resources section of the Company's Impact website. The Company also reports its progress against its adopted purpose-related targets, including the impact of its partnerships, in its annual Impact Report. Therefore, in addition to being costly and time-consuming for the Company to prepare, the report that the Proposal requests would not provide meaningful additional information to the Company's shareholders. BOARD RECOMMENDATION X The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 68 STOCK OWNERSHIP INFORMATION STOCK HOLDINGS OF CERTAIN OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT The following table sets forth the number of shares of the classes of NIKE securities beneficially owned, as of June 28, 2024, after giving effect to any transactions that occurred on such date, by (1) each person known to the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of the Company's securities, (2) each of the directors and nominees for director, (3) each executive officer listed in the Summary Compensation Table ("Named Executive Officers"), and (4) all directors, Named Executive Officers, and other executive officers as a group. Because Class A Stock is convertible into Class B Stock on a share-for-share basis, each beneficial owner of Class A Stock is deemed by the SEC to be a beneficial owner of the same number of shares of Class B Stock. Therefore, in indicating a person's beneficial ownership of shares of Class B Stock in the table, it has been assumed that such person has converted into Class B Stock all shares of Class A Stock of which such person is a beneficial owner. For these reasons the table contains substantial duplications in the numbers of shares and percentages of Class A and Class B Stock shown for Swoosh, LLC, Philip Knight, and the Travis A. Knight 2009 Irrevocable Trust II.

(13) Information provided as of December 29, 2023 in Schedule 13G filed by the shareholder. (14) Information provided as of December 31, 2023 in Schedule 13G filed by the shareholder. DELINQUENT SECTION 16(a) REPORTS Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and holders of more than 10 percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file with the SEC reports regarding their ownership and changes in ownership of Common Stock and other equity securities of the Company. Directors, officers, and greater than 10 percent shareholders are required by the regulations of the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on a review of such reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other reports were required, during fiscal 2024, we believe that all such reports that were required to be filed under Section 16(a) were timely filed, except that one report relating to a September 1, 2023 grant of stock options to Johanna Nielsen was filed late due to an administrative error. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 70 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INSIDER TRADING ARRANGEMENTS AND POLICIES We have adopted insider trading policies and procedures that govern the purchase, sale, and other disposition of our securities by our employees, directors, officers, and consultants. We believe our insider trading policies and procedures are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules, and regulations as well as the exchange listing standards applicable to us. Our insider trading policies and procedures prohibit our employees, directors, officers, and consultants from trading in our securities while in possession of material non-public information, among other things. The foregoing summary of our insider trading policies and procedures does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to our Insider Trading Policy and our Blackout and Pre-clearance Policy, copies of which can be found as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS Philip Knight, the father of NIKE director Travis Knight, serves as Chairman Emeritus, which provides a standing invitation for Philip Knight to attend meetings of the Board and its committees as a non-voting observer. In fiscal 2024, as Chairman Emeritus, Mr. Knight received salary of $519,235 (reflecting 27 bi-weekly pay periods for fiscal 2024), and medical and dental insurance coverage generally available to employees. John Donahoe II and the Company have entered into time sharing agreements under which Mr. Donahoe reimburses the Company for limited personal use of Company aircraft, which is intended to increase his security, availability, and productivity. In fiscal 2024, Mr. Donahoe reimbursed the Company approximately $316,000 under the time sharing agreements. Mark Parker's son, Matthew Parker, was employed by the Company in fiscal 2024 in a non-executive role for which the Company paid Matthew Parker aggregate compensation of approximately $136,000. The compensation and benefits received by Matthew Parker were consistent with compensation and benefits paid to other employees holding similar positions. The Company's written policy requires the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee to review any transaction or proposed transaction with a related person that would be required to be reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, and to determine whether to ratify or approve the transaction, with ratification or approval to occur only if the committee determines that the transaction is fair to the Company or that approval or ratification of the transaction is in the interest of the Company. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION The members of the Compensation Committee of the Board during fiscal 2024 were Timothy Cook, Cathleen Benko, and Mónica Gil. The committee is composed solely of independent, non-employee directors. No member of the Compensation Committee has been an executive officer of the Company, and no member of the Compensation Committee had any relationships requiring disclosure by the Company under the SEC's rules requiring disclosure of certain relationships and related-party transactions. None of the Company's executive officers served as a director or member of a compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, the executive officers of which served as a director or member of the Compensation Committee of the Company during fiscal 2024. OTHER MATTERS AT THE MEETING As of the time this proxy statement was printed, management was unaware of any proposals to be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting other than those set forth herein, but if other matters do properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares represented by such proxy according to their best judgment. 71 NIKE, INC.

How are the proxy materials being distributed? This proxy statement is first being made available to shareholders on or about July 31, 2024. We are furnishing proxy materials to our shareholders primarily via the Internet, by mailing a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials, or "Notice", instead of mailing printed copies of those materials to each shareholder.

If you would prefer to receive a paper copy of our proxy materials, please follow the instructions included in the Notice. If you have previously elected to receive our proxy materials electronically, you will continue to receive access to these materials electronically unless you elect otherwise.

While we initially pivoted to a virtual meeting format due to public health concerns, we are continuing to use this format because, based on the success of our last three annual meetings, we believe that it provides greater accessibility, encourages broader shareholder participation, and helps reduce costs, while still allowing us to provide shareholders the same rights and opportunities to participate as an in-person meeting.

You may vote by proxy or at the Annual Meeting. If you received a printed copy of the proxy materials by mail, you may vote your shares by proxy before the Annual Meeting using one of the following methods: (1) vote via the internet at the website address listed on the Notice; (2) vote by telephone; or (3) complete, sign, date, and return your proxy card or voting instruction form in the postage-paid envelope we have provided. If you received only the Notice, you may vote your shares at the website address listed on the Notice or by telephone. If you plan to vote during the Annual Meeting rather than in advance, you may do so by entering the 16-digit control number included in your Notice, voting instructions form, or proxy card. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, you are encouraged to vote by proxy prior to the meeting. You can always change your vote, as described in more detail under "Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy?" What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner or street name holder? If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered the "shareholder of record" with respect to those shares and we have sent the Notice (or if you received printed proxy materials, the Notice, proxy statement, and proxy card) directly to you. You may submit a proxy and vote those shares in the manner described in this proxy statement and the Notice. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, broker or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in street name. The Notice, voting instructions form, and/or proxy card have been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, or other holder of record who is considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, or other holder of record on how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction card included in the mailing or by following their instructions for voting. What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card or Notice? If you receive more than one proxy card or Notice, it means that you hold shares registered in more than one account. To ensure that all of your shares are voted, please follow the instructions included on each Notice you receive or, if you received printed proxy materials by mail, complete, sign, and return each proxy card you receive. 73 NIKE, INC. How many shares may be voted at the Annual Meeting? On the close of business on July 10, 2024, 297,897,252 shares of Class A Stock and 1,201,461,692 shares of Class B Stock were issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting. What constitutes a quorum? For Proposal 1, the election of directors, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by each of the Class A Stock and Class B Stock separately constitutes a quorum of Class A Stock and Class B Stock, respectively. For Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by both of the Class A Stock and Class B Stock together constitutes a quorum Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Broker non-votes occur when a person holding shares in street name, such as through a brokerage firm, does not provide instructions as to how to vote those shares and the broker does not then vote those shares on the shareholder's behalf. How are votes calculated? Each share of Class A Stock and each share of Class B Stock is entitled to one vote. The holders of our Common Stock will vote together on all matters at the Annual Meeting except for the election of directors, for which the holders of Class A Stock and holders of Class B Stock will vote separately.
