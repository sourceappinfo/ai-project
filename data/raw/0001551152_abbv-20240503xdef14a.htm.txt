Each year, AbbVie completes a robust investor engagement program with governance investment teams. Our engagements in 2023 included discussions on (1) AbbVie’s board composition and board succession planning, (2) the board’s management succession process, (3) AbbVie’s processes and disclosures related to its political expenditures and lobbying activities, (4) AbbVie’s executive compensation programs, (5) AbbVie’s responsiveness to shareholder proposals, and (6) AbbVie’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy and initiatives.  AbbVie also engages each year with each of its stockholders who submit proposals for the annual meeting. Each year, the board reviews feedback from our investor engagements and discusses opportunities to improve AbbVie’s governance practices. The following chart summarizes some of the governance practices that the board has adopted over the past several years as a result of dialogue with our stockholders: ​ ​ ​ ​ Topic: Actions taken by our board: ​ Stockholder Voting Rights approved a management proposal to eliminate supermajority voting (Item 5) to seek stockholder approval to amend the company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to provide for a simple majority of shares outstanding for all provisions previously subject to a supermajority provision and previously submitted the same proposal from 2018 to 2023 as well as a declassification management proposal from 2016 to 2018 ​ Lead Independent Director Role significantly expanded disclosure on the lead independent director responsibilities in the 2018 and 2019 proxy statements, to better inform our stockholders on the robust leadership that the role provides appointed the lead independent director to all committees in 2019, further strengthening his active leadership role ​ Board Skills & Composition added two female directors in 2023 , further strengthening the diversity of our board updated our director biographies in 2023 to include additional skills of interest to our stockholders, such as cybersecurity experience shared our board skills matrix beginning in 2016 and updated the matrix with additional skills in this proxy statement ​ Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Disclosures amended our governance guidelines in 2023 to add specific limits on the number of other directorships a director may hold increased our disclosures on board risk oversight in 2023 enhanced our website disclosures on political contributions and lobbying in 2022, 2023, and 2024 expanded the discussion of board oversight of executive succession planning and company culture in the 2022 proxy statement issued a TCFD aligned report , starting in 2022 and a SASB aligned report , starting in 2021 disclosed detailed data on the diversity of AbbVie’s U.S. workforce by publishing AbbVie’s EEO-1 report on our website starting in 2020 added board diversity data , starting in the 2019 proxy statement 2024 Proxy Statement | 5 Table of Contents ​ ​ PROXY SUMMARY ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Additional highlights of our governance practices include: Director independence ✓ Twelve of AbbVie’s thirteen directors are independent and regularly meet in executive session ✓ Since our inception, we have had a lead independent director with robust responsibilities ✓ All members of our audit, compensation, nominations and governance, and public policy and sustainability committees are independent ​ Stockholder rights ✓ Adopted a proxy access By-Law provision for 3%/3 years ✓ We do not have a stockholder rights plan or “poison pill” ✓ Our directors are elected by a majority vote of our stockholders for uncontested elections, and we have a resignation policy if the director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast ​ Board and executive accountability ✓ Ongoing executive succession planning, including an assessment of the diversity of executive candidates ✓ Minimum stock ownership guidelines are in place for the CEO and other NEOs ✓ We have a related person transaction policy to ensure appropriate oversight ✓ We hold an annual say-on-pay advisory vote on executive compensation ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Board composition and effectiveness ✓ Our governance guidelines restrict the number of boards our directors may serve on to prevent overboarding ✓ Annual board and committee self-assessments and annual board succession planning ✓ For inclusion on the board, the nominations and governance committee considers diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, age, and geography, together with other voluntarily identified diversity criteria ​ Clawback and anti-hedging and anti-pledging policies ✓ Mandatory clawback of excess compensation in the event of a restatement, plus broad discretion to clawback compensation in the event of a material breach of the Code of Conduct ✓ Directors and executive officers are prohibited from buying or selling any financial instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of AbbVie equity securities they hold ✓ Directors and executive officers are prohibited from pledging AbbVie stock as collateral for a loan ​ Other ESG practices ✓ ESG and equity, equality, diversity, and inclusion (EEDI) goals are incorporated into our executive compensation programs for all executives ✓ We are guided by strong ethics programs and supplier guidelines ✓ We disclose our corporate political contributions, our trade association memberships, and oversight process on our website and expanded these disclosures in 2022, 2023, and 2024 ​ ​ Board Response to 2023 Simple Majority Stockholder Proposal At AbbVie’s 2023 stockholder meeting, the simple majority stockholder proposal received approximately 53% support. This proposal sought to replace any supermajority vote standards in AbbVie’s Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws with a simple majority of votes cast standard. As a result of this vote outcome, we prioritized discussing this proposal with our stockholders during our fall 2023 engagements.  We reached out to stockholders representing over 40% of our outstanding shares, requesting to engage on the simple majority proposal and other topics, and conducted engagements via phone or video conference with stockholders representing over 30% of our outstanding shares.  Our primary goal was to educate our stockholders on the board’s history of submitting management proposals to eliminate supermajority voting.  Namely, from 2018 through 2024, the board has approved a management proposal to replace any supermajority vote standards in AbbVie’s Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws with a simple majority of outstanding shares standard.  This management proposal itself requires 80% of outstanding shares to vote in favor to pass.  In 2023, only approximately 70% of outstanding shares voted in favor of the proposal. It is important to note that the board does not have authority to eliminate 6 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ PROXY SUMMARY ​ supermajority voting itself; the only way these provisions can be eliminated is via the support of 80% of outstanding shares for the management proposal. We also aimed to gather feedback from stockholders on the difference between the stockholder proponent’s preferred standard (i.e., simple majority of votes cast) and the standard in the management proposal (i.e., simple majority of outstanding shares).  Stockholders did not express a strong view on this difference and generally expressed support for any effort to move away from supermajority voting.  The board favors simple majority of outstanding shares, as it creates greater predictability regarding vote outcomes at meetings. Stockholders expressed support for AbbVie’s history of commitment on this topic, and many noted that they support stockholder proposals on simple majority voting as a matter of default policy (as opposed to a specific concern at AbbVie). Investors consistently expressed support for a continued management proposal on this topic, noting that putting forward the same management proposal in 2024 would be deemed as responsive to the passing 2023 stockholder proposal. ​ 2024 Proxy Statement | 7 Table of Contents ​ ​ PROXY SUMMARY ​ ​ Our ESG Highlights As a research-driven global biopharmaceutical company, we apply the same high standards and rigor to the medicines and solutions we pursue, to how we operate our business.

To further strategic and enterprise-aligned delivery on AbbVie’s ESG Framework, we maintain an ESG Council, chaired by our Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs, and composed of senior-level leaders from across the company. The ESG Council’s purpose is to champion business sustainability and mitigate business risks by monitoring, reviewing, and recommending actions to the ESG Council Chair, members of the executive leadership team, and AbbVie’s CEO. The ESG Council Chair may also present certain recommendations of the ESG Council from time to time to the board of directors as appropriate. ​ The ESG Council meets regularly and maintains sub-committees that are aligned to AbbVie’s material drivers. With this governance in place, AbbVie is well-positioned to recognize ESG opportunities and advance its ESG objectives. ​ ​ ESG Action Report ​ In 2023, we further strengthened our ESG Action Report by enhancing transparency of our ESG strategies and efforts. Published in May 2023, the 2022 ESG Action Report includes detailed commentary about our approach, actions, and commitments across material drivers; over 100 KPIs showing our progress (a more than 30% increase in KPIs from our previous report); and ESG-related recognitions of our efforts.

The committee then takes into account the company’s overall performance against the financial, operating and strategic objectives that were established at the start of the performance period. Finally, specific pay determinations are made for each NEO based on individual performance against goals and contributions to the short- and long-term performance of the company.

AbbVie encourages its board members to attend the annual stockholder meeting. All of AbbVie’s directors at the time attended the 2023 annual stockholder meeting.

To determine independence, the board applied the AbbVie Inc. director independence guidelines. The board also considered whether a director has any other material relationships with AbbVie or its subsidiaries and concluded that none of these directors had a relationship that impaired the director’s independence. This included consideration of the fact that some of the directors are officers or serve on boards of companies or entities to which AbbVie sold products or made contributions or from which AbbVie purchased products and services during the year. This also included consideration of the fact that one director serves on the board of Abbott Laboratories (Abbott), AbbVie’s former parent. In making its determination, the board relied on both information provided by the directors and information developed internally by AbbVie. AbbVie directors have backgrounds that when combined provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that serve AbbVie’s governance and strategic needs. Director nominees are considered based on a range of criteria including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence and excellent reputations in their primary fields of endeavor, as well as a global business perspective and commitment to good corporate citizenship, diversity, and ability to commit sufficient time and attention to the activities of the board. They must have demonstrated experience and ability that is relevant to the board’s oversight role with respect to AbbVie’s business and affairs. They must also be able and willing to represent the stockholders’ economic interests and satisfy their fiduciary duties to stockholders without conflicts of interest.

Each year, the board and its committees conduct detailed self-evaluations covering topics such as board and committee leadership structure, composition and effectiveness, quality of board and committee materials and discussions, priority agenda items, schedule sufficiency, and board processes. To ensure candid feedback, the evaluations are anonymous. The full board, led by the lead independent director, discusses the evaluation reports to determine what, if any, actions or improvements should be undertaken in the near-term and long-term. The board, committee, and CEO evaluations are discussed in executive session to allow for additional candid discussion. Committee chairs are elected annually. Each director’s biography includes the particular experience and qualifications that led the board to conclude that the director should serve on the board and how their qualifications add to the mix of skills on the board.

Numerous other factors support the board’s decision to ask Mr. Gonzalez to serve as Executive Chairman, such as: ● The performance of the company under Mr. Gonzalez’s leadership .  As discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, under the leadership of Mr. Gonzalez, AbbVie has established an outstanding track record of performance. ● The performance and evaluation of Mr. Gonzalez in his roles as CEO and Chair, including stockholder votes in favor of Mr. Gonzalez’s re-election .  When he was most recently up for re-election, Mr. Gonzalez received nearly 94% of votes in favor. AbbVie will continue to utilize a lead independent director following the CEO succession event. facilitates communication with the board and presides over regularly conducted executive sessions of the independent directors or sessions where the chair of the board is not present reviews and approves matters, such as schedule sufficiency, and, where appropriate, information provided to other board members serves as the liaison between the chair of the board and the independent directors has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors leads the board’s evaluation of the CEO leads the annual board and committee evaluation process, including discussing evaluations with each director individually ​ encourages effective director participation by fostering an environment of open dialogue and constructive feedback among independent directors involved in selection and interviewing of new board members if requested by major stockholders, ensures that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication as needed if required, represents independent board members externally, including in communications with stockholders and other stakeholders performs such other duties as the board may determine from time to time ​ Our Lead Independent Director has robust and well-defined responsibilities that provide our board with significant leadership and oversight: ✓ leads the CEO succession planning process ✓ facilitates communication with the board and presides over regularly conducted executive sessions of the independent directors or sessions where the chair of the board is not present ✓ reviews and approves matters, such as schedule sufficiency, and, where appropriate, information provided to other board members ✓ serves as the liaison between the chair of the board and the independent directors ✓ has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors ✓ leads the board’s evaluation of the CEO ✓ leads the annual board and committee evaluation process, including discussing evaluations with each director individually ✓ reviews and guides agenda items for board meetings ✓ encourages effective director participation by fostering an environment of open dialogue and constructive feedback among independent directors ✓ involved in selection and interviewing of new board members ✓ if requested by major stockholders, ensures that they are available for consultation and direct communication as needed ✓ if required, represents independent board members externally, including in communications with stockholders and other stakeholders ✓ performs such other duties as the board may determine from time to time All directors are encouraged to, and in fact do, consult with the chair on each of the above topics, as well. The lead director, and each of the other directors, communicates regularly with the chair of the board and CEO regarding appropriate agenda topics and other board related matters.  All directors, including the lead independent director, are tasked with ensuring the board appropriately exercises its risk management 2024 Proxy Statement | 23 Table of Contents ​ ​ THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES ​ ​ responsibilities and facilitate further discussion of risk matters in executive session as they deem necessary. The lead independent director is chosen annually by and from the independent members of the board of directors. The board also regularly reviews its own succession planning, including for committee chairs and the lead independent director. As part of this process, the board has elected Roxanne Austin to serve as AbbVie’s next lead independent director, effective July 1, 2024.  Ms. Austin has held leadership positions on AbbVie’s board since 2013 and her substantial executive and publicly traded board experience enhances her ability to exercise effective independent leadership of the board. Glenn Tilton has served as AbbVie’s lead independent director since 2013. Mr. Tilton’s extensive leadership skills as a non-executive chair, as well as former CEO and chair at large, publicly traded companies, and the depth of his current and past experience as a director at other publicly traded companies ensure that he is able to exercise effective independent leadership over AbbVie’s board, including in relationship to risk oversight. In October 2023, the board approved an extension of Mr. Tilton’s service as a director, until December 2025, as permitted under AbbVie’s Governance Guidelines, which state that “a nonmanagement director shall retire as a director on the day of the annual shareholders’ meeting following his or her 75th birthday; provided, however, that the full board may make exceptions from time to time due to special circumstances.”  Mr. Tilton’s continued service on the board will provide valuable leadership and continuity during AbbVie’s CEO transition. Board Oversight Responsibilities The board has risk oversight responsibility for AbbVie and administers this responsibility both directly and with assistance from its committees. The board reviews enterprise risks and discusses them with our senior management on a regular basis.  These risks include those the company faces over various time horizons.  Among the risks are those that are specific to AbbVie’s business and circumstances (e.g., pipeline advancement and significant product loss of exclusivity), those that are specific to AbbVie’s industry (e.g., manufacturing and regulatory compliance and health care industry dynamics such as pricing and patient access), and those faced by large, complex, multinational companies generally (e.g., tax policy). Specific relevant risk topics are reviewed and escalated to the board or relevant committee at nearly all board meetings throughout the year. The charters of the committees provide a framework for the types of risks to be reviewed at each committee and reported on to the full board.  The focus of the board’s oversight varies based on the type and timing of the risk being discussed.  For example, for a long-term risk, the board focuses on advance planning to mitigate the risk over time. AbbVie has a comprehensive enterprise risk management (ERM) program with risk management embedded within the operations of the company, clear accountability at the senior leadership level, and oversight by the board.  The audit committee oversees ERM.  Through risk owners and the internal disclosure committee, there is a routine assessment of material risks to the company.  Updates, if any, are provided to the board or its committees together with updated public disclosures, when relevant.  In light of the regular assessment of risk, the board or risk owner may consult with outside advisors to evaluate the risk landscape and anticipate trends.  As the company grows, relevant risk management topics may be added, such as following a large acquisition. Acting with integrity is one of the foundational AbbVie Principles, and overseeing the company’s compliance program is a key activity for the board.  AbbVie’s Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, who reports to the Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, regularly presents to the board and committees on compliance matters. The board oversees AbbVie’s culture, employee engagement, and overall management of human capital. This oversight ensures that AbbVie is attracting, developing, and retaining best in class employees dedicated to making a remarkable impact on patients’ lives around the world.  Examples of this oversight include (1) reviewing results of the biennial all employee survey, which assesses topics like employee engagement, inclusion, agility in processes, ethical decision making, and other issues critical to the company’s culture, (2) oversight of the company’s equity, equality, diversity, and inclusion strategy, (3) oversight of employee health and safety data and priorities, (4) reviewing the company’s commitment to pay equity and results from the equity analysis to ensure this commitment is met, and (5) oversight of the company’s ESG strategy, including the human capital management components.  The board also interacts with employees at various levels of seniority, not solely on the executive leadership team, which facilitates a better understanding of the company’s culture. 24 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES ​ The board is actively involved in reviewing AbbVie’s privacy, cybersecurity, and other information technology risks and opportunities and discusses these topics on a regular basis.  The board and its committees also regularly review other environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics, including across all of AbbVie’s material ESG drivers.  For more details about committee responsibilities and oversight, please see the committee discussion on pages 25-27. ​ Board Diversity ​ ​ AbbVie is committed to diversity in its workforce and on its board of directors. AbbVie serves patients in over 175 countries and across many different diseases. A diverse workforce and a diverse board are critical to bringing innovative new medicines to patients and to meeting their unique needs. In particular, diverse perspectives strengthen the oversight of AbbVie’s business. 38% female board members 15% ethnically or racially diverse board members Diversity, including diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, age, and geography is an integral factor in identifying prospective directors. In the process of identifying nominees to serve as a member of the board of directors, the nominations and governance committee considers the existing board’s diversity and assesses the effectiveness of the recruitment process in achieving a diverse board. Periodically, the board engages a third-party search firm to aid in its recruitment and refreshment activities. More details about our workforce diversity efforts are available in the ‘‘Our ESG Highlights’’ section of this proxy statement. ​ Committees of the Board of Directors ​ Audit Committee ​ ​ ​ ​ Members ​ Key Characteristics and Responsibilities Meetings in 2023: 6 T.

The charter sets forth the purposes of the compensation committee, identifies qualifications required for the compensation committee members, and describes the committee’s authority and responsibilities. ✓ This committee assists the board of directors in carrying out the board’s responsibilities relating to the compensation of AbbVie’s executive officers and directors. The compensation committee annually reviews the compensation paid to the directors and gives its recommendations to the full board regarding both the amount of director compensation that should be paid and the allocation of that compensation between equity-based awards and cash. ✓ In recommending director compensation, the compensation committee takes into account director fees paid by companies in AbbVie’s Health Care Peer Group and reviews any arrangement that could be viewed as indirect director compensation. The processes and procedures used for the consideration and determination of executive compensation are described in the ‘‘Compensation Discussion and Analysis’’ section of this proxy statement. ✓ The committee also reviews, approves, and administers the incentive compensation plans in which the AbbVie executive officers participate and all of AbbVie’s equity-based plans. It may delegate the responsibility to administer and make grants under these plans to management, except to the extent that such delegation would be inconsistent with applicable law or regulations or with the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange. ✓ The compensation committee has the sole authority, under its charter, to select, retain and/or terminate independent advisors who may assist the committee in carrying out its responsibilities. ✓ The compensation committee reviews and discusses with management and its independent compensation consultant potential risks associated with AbbVie’s compensation policies and practices as discussed in the ‘‘Compensation Risk Assessment’’ section of this proxy statement. Each member of the committee qualifies as a ‘‘non-employee director’’ for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. The compensation committee has engaged Semler Brossy as its independent compensation consultant. The independent compensation consultant provides counsel and advice to the committee on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. Semler Brossy, and its principal, report directly to the chair of the committee. The principal meets regularly, and as needed, with the committee in executive sessions, and has direct access to the committee chair during and between meetings. In partnership with the consultant, the committee determines what variables it will consider, including: peer groups against which performance and pay should be examined, metrics to be used in incentive plans to assess AbbVie’s performance, competitive short- and long-term incentive practices in the marketplace, and compensation levels relative to market benchmarks. The committee negotiates and approves all fees paid to Semler Brossy for these services. AbbVie did not engage Semler Brossy to perform any other services during 2023. Based on an assessment of internally developed information and information provided by Semler Brossy, the committee has determined that its independent compensation consultant does not have a conflict of interest. A copy of the compensation committee report is included in the ‘‘Compensation Committee Report’’ section of this proxy statement. ​ 26 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES ​ Nominations and Governance Committee ​ Members ​ Key Characteristics and Responsibilities Meetings in 2023: 4 E.

The chair of the audit committee received $30,000 per year for service as chair of that committee and the other members of the audit committee received $10,000 per year as a committee member. The lead director received $50,000 in 2023 for service in that role. The non-employee director and committee fees are earned monthly for each calendar month or portion thereof that the director holds the position, excluding the month in which the director is first elected to the position. Fees earned under the AbbVie Non-Employee Directors’ Fee Plan are, at the director’s election, paid in cash, delivered in the form of vested non-qualified stock options (based on an independent appraisal of their fair value), deferred until retirement (as an unfunded AbbVie obligation), or paid currently into an individual grantor trust established by an eligible director. The distribution of deferred fees and amounts held in a director’s grantor trust generally commences at the later of when the director reaches age 65 or upon retirement from the board of directors. Fees deposited in a trust may be credited to a stock equivalent account that earns the same return as if the fees were invested in AbbVie stock or to a guaranteed interest account. If necessary, AbbVie contributes funds to a director’s trust so that as of year-end the stock equivalent account balance (net of taxes) is not less than seventy-five percent of the market value of the related AbbVie common stock at year end. (2) The amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted during 2023, determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718. AbbVie determines the grant date fair value of the awards by multiplying the number of units granted by the average of the high and low market prices of one share of AbbVie common stock on the award grant date. In addition to the fees described in footnote (1), each non-employee director elected to or serving on the board of directors on the day of the 2023 annual stockholder meeting received under the AbbVie Amended 2024 Proxy Statement | 29 Table of Contents ​ ​ DIRECTOR COMPENSATION ​ ​ and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program vested restricted stock units with a target grant date value of $215,000. In 2023, this equated to 1,450 restricted stock units (after rounding the award down to the nearest whole unit), with a reportable value of $214,977. The non-employee directors receive cash payments equal to the dividends paid on the shares covered by the units at the same rate as other stockholders, but do not otherwise have access to the restricted stock units during their board service. Upon termination or retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of the company, a non-employee director will receive one common share for each restricted stock unit outstanding under the Incentive Stock Program. The following AbbVie restricted stock units were outstanding as of December 31, 2023: R. Alpern, 32,992; R. Austin, 24,433; W. Burnside, 24,433; J. Davis, 0; T. Freyman, 6,885; B. Hart, 16,947; M. Meyer, 13,973; S. Quaggin, 0; E. Rapp, 24,433; R. Roberts, 11,203; G. Tilton, 24,433; and F. Waddell, 24,433. These numbers include, where applicable, AbbVie restricted stock units issued with respect to Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) restricted stock units outstanding when AbbVie separated from Abbott on January 1, 2013. (3) No AbbVie stock options were outstanding as of December 31, 2023 . (4) The totals in this column include reportable interest credited under the AbbVie Non-Employee Directors’ Fee Plan during 2023 . (5) Charitable contributions made by AbbVie’s non-employee directors are eligible for a matching contribution (up to $25,000 annually). For 2023 contributions, the AbbVie Foundation made charitable matching contributions on behalf of the following AbbVie directors: R. Alpern, $25,000; R. Austin, $25,000; W. Burnside, $32,500; J. Davis, $25,000; T. Freyman, $25,000; B. Hart, $25,000; M. Meyer, $25,000; S.

AbbVie dispersed $32,500 in charitable matching for Mr. Burnside during 2023, however, $7,500 of this amount represents a match for a charitable contribution made by Mr. Burnside at the end of 2022.  The total match for his 2023 charitable contributions was therefore $25,000.

For context, Humira had net revenue of $18.6 billion in the U.S. in 2022, which represented approximately 32% of AbbVie’s revenue. Nine biosimilars entered the market in 2023 in direct competition with Humira, more than any other biologic on the market today. Leading up to this period of LOE, management’s strategic focus was to develop and launch next-generation immunology therapies, as well as to build out our therapeutic pillars in oncology, neuroscience, eyecare, and aesthetics, in order to offset the impact of declining Humira revenue on the overall strength of AbbVie’s business. For 2023, the compensation committee made changes to our compensation programs, in particular, our short- 34 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ and long-term incentive programs, to reduce payouts due to the impact of U.S. Humira LOE. This included, for example, formulaic changes to reduce the cap on short-term incentives and exercising downward discretion to further reduce payouts. More detail on these changes is provided in the following sections, including on pages 42-48. In assessing these program changes, and making final compensation decisions, the committee was cognizant that the U.S. Humira LOE resulted in reduced revenue in 2023 compared to 2022 (and further impacted related measures, such as net income and earnings per share). However, the committee also considered the company’s strong achievements against its 2023 targets along with its outstanding financial performance and long-term value creation. For example, platform revenue exceeded the company’s 2023 target by $1.2 billion and income before taxes exceeded target by $1.3 billion. More detail regarding 2023’s performance is on the following pages. The committee also weighed that without the thoughtful strategy and execution by Mr. Gonzalez and his senior executive team, it is highly likely the impact of U.S. Humira LOE on the financial results would have been more significant. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2024 Proxy Statement | 35 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ BUSINESS PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS Advanced our strategy through outstanding operational execution and investments in innovation during 2023 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Net Revenues Growth Platform Net Revenues Operating Cash Flow $54.3BN ​ ​ $39.9BN ​ ​ $22.8BN -6.4% compared to 2022* ​ ​ +8.4% compared to 2022** ​ ​ in 2023 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Blockbuster Products ​ ​ Adjusted R&D Investment ​ ​ Development Pipeline 12 ​ ​ $7.8BN ​ ​ ~90 assets with 2023 net revenues > $1.0BN ​ ​ increased $0.7BN compared to 2022*** ​ ​ active clinical and device programs**** ​ The measures set forth in this table were calculated as of 12/31/2023. * Decline primarily due to the U.S. Humira loss of exclusivity in 2023. ** Growth Platform reflects total net revenues less Humira net revenues. *** Reflects a non-GAAP measure and is adjusted for certain items, which are reconciled in Appendix B. **** Compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements. ​ ​ ​ ​ Strong operational execution ● Total net revenues of $54.3 billion, driven by strong performance from our Growth Platform and successful management of the U.S. Humira loss of exclusivity (LOE). o Key asset performance drove Growth Platform net revenues of $39.9 billion, an increase of 8.4% compared to 2022. o AbbVie had eight assets in its Growth Platform with double-digit sales growth in 2023, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, and Vraylar. o AbbVie retained strong parity access for U.S. Humira. ● Reported diluted EPS of $2.72 on a GAAP basis and adjusted diluted EPS of $11.11.

Key components of our annual compensation program are listed below. Base Salary Designed to be competitive with market and industry norms, and to reflect individual performance Individual salaries are established relative to market median based on each NEO’s individual performance, skills, and experience, and internal equity, as well as the company’s annual operating budget ​ Short-Term Incentives Performance Incentive Plan (PIP) Based on non-GAAP performance measures such as: — Platform revenue — Income before taxes — Operating margin — Return on assets — Strategic and leadership goals ​ Long-Term Incentives 80% Performance shares and performance-vested restricted stock units 20% Non-qualified stock options ​ Our Compensation Philosophy ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Align executive interests with the drivers of stockholder returns and profitable growth ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Support achievement of the company’s primary business goals to have a remarkable impact on patients’ lives Attract and retain world-class executives whose talents and contributions sustain the growth in long-term stockholder value ​ The compensation committee is dedicated to ensuring that a substantial portion of executive compensation is “at-risk” and variable. Generally, more than three-fourths of our NEOs’ total direct compensation is variable and directly affected by both the company’s and the NEO’s performance, as indicated below. ​ ​ The committee believes the use of non-GAAP metrics to measure company performance for incentive plan purposes is appropriate. The use of certain non-GAAP metrics aligns NEOs to performance objectives that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of the company, provide accountability, and avoid inappropriate windfalls or penalties due to factors outside of their control. Importantly, both the goals and the financial performance are presented on a consistent non-GAAP basis. 40 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ Executive Compensation Process COMMITMENT TO PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS As discussed above, the majority of AbbVie’s NEO pay is performance-based. Specific goals and targets are the foundation of our pay-for-performance process. Though quantitative metrics such as financial and operational results are a central part of our performance assessment, some goals such as leadership and progress against strategic and long-term objectives are difficult to measure using numeric or formulaic criteria. As such, the compensation committee also conducts a qualitative assessment of individual performance to ensure the overall assessment of performance and pay decisions are aligned with the company’s true performance over a period of time. A discussion of the decision-making criteria for each pay component follows. COMMITTEE PROCESS FOR SETTING TOTAL COMPENSATION Each February, the committee, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant and AbbVie’s management team, determines pay levels for NEOs. The process starts with a consideration of compensation levels and the mix of compensation for comparable executives at companies in AbbVie’s Health Care Peer Group, which are listed below in the section captioned “Compensation Benchmarking.” After this benchmark review, the committee establishes NEO compensation—base salary adjustments, annual incentive awards, and long-term incentive awards—relative to the peer median in each instance. Awards can be differentiated from the peer compensation levels based on company performance, each NEO’s individual performance, leadership, and contributions to AbbVie’s business and strategic performance. COMPENSATION BENCHMARKING To provide the appropriate context for executive pay decisions, the committee, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, assesses the compensation practices and pay levels of AbbVie’s Health Care Peer Group. The committee chooses to focus on the Health Care Peer Group because its constituents share important characteristics with AbbVie, particularly the global emphasis on research-based pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceutical therapies and the regulatory environment within which they operate. Members of the Health Care Peer Group are AbbVie’s primary competitors for executive talent and are companies the committee believes chiefly represent our competitive market: ​ Health Care Peer Group Amgen, Inc. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Eli Lilly and Company ​ Gilead Sciences, Inc. ​ GlaxoSmithKline plc ​ Johnson & Johnson ​ Merck & Company, Inc. ​ Novartis AG ​ Pfizer Inc. ​ ROLE OF THE COMPENSATION CONSULTANT The compensation committee has engaged Semler Brossy as its independent compensation consultant. The committee’s independent consultant reports directly to the chair of the committee. The consultant meets regularly, and as needed, with the committee in executive sessions, has direct access to the chair during and between meetings, and performs no other services for AbbVie or its senior executives. In partnership with the consultant, the committee determines what variables it will consider, which include: peer groups against which performance and pay should be examined, metrics to be used to assess AbbVie’s performance, competitive incentive practices in the marketplace, and compensation levels relative to market benchmarks. 2024 Proxy Statement | 41 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ COMPENSATION RISK OVERSIGHT The company has established, and the compensation committee endorses, several controls to address and mitigate compensation-related risk, such as employing a diverse set of performance metrics, maintaining robust stock ownership guidelines for its executives and non- employee directors, and retaining broad discretion to recover incentive awards in the event of misconduct that would constitute a material breach of the AbbVie Code of Business Conduct.  The company’s clawback policy also requires recoupment of excess compensation in the event earnings are subsequently restated.  The committee, in collaboration with its independent compensation consultant, identified no material risks in AbbVie’s compensation programs in 2023. When considering compensation-related risk, the committee is aware of certain risks associated with drug pricing decisions. The committee weighs these, as well as other risks material to the company, when designing AbbVie’s compensation programs. In addition, the committee, comprised entirely of independent directors, has discretion to adjust incentive payments, if needed, including to reflect decisions executives make that may impact AbbVie’s reputation and long-term sustainability. Compensation Plan Elements As referenced on page 40, three primary components make up AbbVie’s executive pay program: (1) base salary, (2) short-term incentives and (3) long-term incentives. The structure of each component is tailored to serve a specific function and purpose. BASE SALARY The compensation committee sets appropriate levels of base salary to ensure that AbbVie can attract and retain a leadership team that will continue to meet our commitments to customers and patients and sustain long-term profitable growth for our stockholders. Generally, the committee considers the median of the Health Care Peer Group as an initial benchmark, but also references additional information as needed. Specific pay rates are then established for each NEO relative to their market benchmark based on the NEO’s performance, experience, unique skills, internal equity with others at AbbVie, and the company’s operating budget. SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES AND 2023 RESULTS This section describes the structure of our short-term incentive program for NEOs and provides further details about the ways the committee’s pay decisions in 2023 reflected the impact of U.S. Humira LOE, both in terms of the headwinds it created for our growth objectives as well as our significant efforts to minimize its effect, as evidenced by our strong execution against targets. Annual cash incentives are paid to NEOs through AbbVie’s Performance Incentive Plan (PIP), which rewards executives for achieving key financial and non-financial goals measured at the company and individual levels. AbbVie’s PIP structure is designed to align NEOs’ interests directly with AbbVie’s annual operating strategies to advance our mission, financial goals, and leadership behaviors. In doing so, it provides a direct link between the NEOs’ short-term incentives and the company’s and the NEOs’ annual performance results through measurable financial and operational performance followed by qualitative assessments of clearly defined strategic progress and leadership behaviors. NEO target incentive amounts are set as a percentage of base salary. Mr. Gonzalez’s target is 165% of base salary. The targets for the other NEOs range from 110% to 135% of base salary. The performance targets established under our annual incentive plan are rigorous and calibrated to a range of potential outcomes, with above target payouts for strong performance and below target payouts (including no payout) for below target performance. Targets are based on expected business, market and regulatory conditions, including expectations for our pipeline. The financial goals were carried by all of the NEOs as part of their 2023 performance goals. 42 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ The short-term incentive goals and their respective weightings are summarized in the chart below.

The Platform Revenue target and result are adjusted for foreign exchange because it is unpredictable at the time the target is set. (3) Evaluated on a constant currency basis. Short-Term Incentive Strategic and Leadership Goals Each NEO achieved or exceeded their 2023 strategic and leadership goals, which are listed below: ● Richard A. Gonzalez: Drive top-tier business performance; execute key strategic initiatives to drive sustainable long-term business performance; deliver value to our stockholders, building investor confidence and credibility; successfully advance mid- and late-stage pipeline assets; continue to drive employee engagement and motivation around AbbVie’s mission and future prospects; and advance our transformation to a biopharmaceutical culture. ● Robert A. Michael: Achieve proprietary pharmaceutical pipeline enhancement objectives and key product milestones; and provide support on corporate strategic initiatives and build shareholder value through investor activities. ● Scott T. Reents: Drive enterprise finance strategic initiatives and transformation; and achieve transaction integration objectives. ● Jeffrey R. Stewart: Achieve key product milestones; drive patient access for all therapies across the different franchises; and successfully adapt and execute market strategies relative to external considerations. ● Azita Saleki-Gerhardt: Successfully drive operations optimization and milestones; execute on objectives including product launches and financial goals; and support research and development initiatives per company strategy. Assessments of performance against financial results consider the effect of foreign exchange and other specified adjustments and/or unusual or unpredictable events, and the appropriateness of these adjustments is reviewed annually by the committee. In 2023, specified adjustments included intangible asset amortization, acquisition and 2024 Proxy Statement | 43 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ integration-related costs, IPR&D and milestones expense, change in fair value of contingent consideration, impacts related to tax law changes, and other items, as described in Appendix B. In 2023, our NEOs continued to take a formal goal aligned to driving AbbVie’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework.  The ESG goal was weighted 10% within the short-term incentive program for each NEO.  As part of this ESG goal category, all senior leaders, including the NEOs, continued to take a goal aligned to executing the equity, equality, diversity, and inclusion (EEDI) strategy. AbbVie’s senior executives have different areas of focus when it comes to driving the company’s ESG framework, and together, the executives’ ESG accomplishments under this goal cover all of AbbVie’s material ESG drivers (which are discussed in more detail on page 8 of this proxy statement). Example achievements under the ESG goal category in 2023 by AbbVie’s senior executives included, for example: ● Over 218,000 U.S. patients were provided medicine at no cost through our patient assistance program in 2023. ● AbbVie’s science-based targets were validated by SBTi in 2023 and include a Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction target, a 100% renewable electricity target and a supplier engagement target for AbbVie’s largest scope 3 categories. ● In the United States, we held our first Ethics and Compliance Week in 2023, including multiple informational sessions and interviews with senior leaders about the importance of acting with integrity. ​ Our EEDI strategy includes specific priority areas to ensure AbbVie fosters a community that is inclusive and working for our people, patients and business. 2023 progress on this strategy includes: ● Fostering a diverse workforce . Developing and delivering innovative life-changing medicines for our diverse patient population with unique health challenges, requiring thoughtfulness and creativity that comes from a wide range of inputs. With this viewpoint in mind, we continued to design and implement talent attraction, sourcing, and hiring solutions, as well as talent development and management approaches, that meet our employees’ talent and career needs. The diversity we seek is broad and includes many unique life experiences and factors. We are proud of our ability to hire and promote based on merit and qualification while still fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce. ● Building inclusive leadership and belonging . We continued our focus on enhancing the inclusive-leader competency in our people leaders, with emphasis on understanding, skill building, ownership and accountability. We continued to build more equitable and inclusive leadership behaviors related to how leaders operate themselves and how they develop their teams. ● Strengthening community, well-being and belonging . We continued to enhance the impact of our inclusive culture by addressing opportunities for belonging and well-being. This includes continuing our series of employee voice sessions, focused on enhancing workplace culture and advancing inclusion, and introducing new resources, such as our Inclusive Benefits Guide. ​ Annual Incentive Payout Matrix Determining actual incentive amounts is a multi-step process.  A formal payout matrix based on platform revenue and income before taxes guides the committee by capping the range of final awards at or below the plan maximum of 200% of target. The matrix is used to ensure alignment between PIP payout outcomes and company financial performance. In light of the U.S. Humira LOE, in early 2023, the compensation committee reduced the payout matrix 10% across all payout ranges. For example, a payout range of 90%-140% instead of 100%-150%. The committee considers this design change to be temporary and expects to transition back to typical ranges as AbbVie absorbs the impact of U.S. Humira LOE and returns to robust growth. In determining individual awards, an initial performance score is calculated for each NEO based on performance against weighted financial and strategic/leadership goals. This performance score results in a preliminary award 44 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ amount of up to 100% of target only. Final awards are determined by the compensation committee based on a qualitative assessment of holistic performance and within the cap established from the matrix.

In light of the expected financial implications in 2023 directly related to U.S. Humira LOE, the committee set rigorous financial targets for the year but also reduced corresponding payouts by 10% recognizing that the U.S. Humira LOE was a hinderance toward year-over-year growth. For 2023, actual platform revenue performance was 103% compared to target, while actual income before taxes was 106% compared to target. ​ Annual Incentive ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2023 Target vs. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2023 Actual vs. ​ Payout Matrix (1) 2022 Actual 2023 Target 2022 Actual 2023 Actual 2023 Target ​ Platform Revenue (2) ​ $ 37.6 BN (2) $ 38.8 BN ​ 103 % $ 40.0 BN (2) 103 % Non - GAAP Income Before Taxes ​ $ 29.2 BN (3) ​ $ 23.1 BN ​ 79 % $ 24.4 BN (3) ​ 106 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2023 Payout ​ ​ Capped at 190% of target ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Matrix Result ​ ​ (below 200% plan maximum) ​ (1) Results achieved reflect certain specified items, which are reconciled in Appendix B.

Comments on the PIP Bonus Paid to Richard A. Gonzalez, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The committee awarded Mr. Gonzalez a bonus of $3,500,000, positioned at approximately the 50 th percentile when compared to peer bonuses paid in 2023 and 125% of his target bonus opportunity, noting that it aligned with the strong execution in 2023 against plan and against the significantly challenging backdrop of U.S. Humira LOE. The committee also noted that Mr. Gonzalez’s bonus was 11% lower than the bonus he earned for 2022, and 29% lower than the bonus he earned for 2021 (see illustration below). The committee believes this outcome appropriately balances the company’s strong achievement against plan with the reduction in actual financial results compared to prior years. It also noted that without the thoughtful strategy to navigate the challenging conditions in 2023 that was conceived, developed, and executed by the senior executive team, led by Mr. Gonzalez, it is highly likely the impact of U.S. Humira LOE on the financial results would have been more significant. ​ 2024 Proxy Statement | 45 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ ​ Final Committee Decisions Final awards are determined by the compensation committee and include a qualitative assessment of holistic performance. While the committee relies heavily on objective, quantitative metrics to determine PIP awards, this qualitative element ensures the review is comprehensive and includes all individual, strategic, and leadership goals for which assessment is not dictated solely by numeric or formulaic applications. Moreover, while each participant has predetermined goals, the committee also considers relative achievements and/or developments in the company, the marketplace, and the global economy that could not have been foreseen when individual goals were established. ​ In determining final bonuses for 2023, the committee first applied downward discretion to reduce the maximum cap on PIP bonus outcomes from 190% suggested by the payout matrix to 170%. This was done primarily in response to lower actual results compared to 2022 and to calibrate overall pay outcomes with performance and governance considerations. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 46 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ The results for each of our NEOs are shown below. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Target Award ​ Executive ​ $ Value % of Salary ​ $ Actual Award Paid Richard A.

In 2023, NEOs received annual grant LTI awards with the following characteristics: Long-Term Incentive Program ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Award Type Metric Performance Period 40% Performance Shares ​ EPS 3 ‑ Year Relative TSR Modifier ​ 3 Years 40% Performance ‑ Vested Restricted Stock Units ​ Relative Return on Invested Capital ​ 3 Years 20% Non ‑ Qualified Stock Options ​ Stock Price Appreciation ​ 10 ‑ year term ● Performance Shares (40% of total LTI award) —These awards have the potential to vest at 0% to 250% of target after a three-year performance period and are earned based on company performance in earnings per share (EPS) and relative total stockholder return (TSR). TSR performance is measured relative to a group made up of companies that are constituents in either the S&P Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Life Science Index or the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Dividends on performance shares accrue during the performance period and are paid at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. ● As a result of the committee’s assessment of program changes in light of U.S. Humira LOE, the payout curve associated with EPS, which was anticipated to be impacted by U.S. Humira LOE, was reset so that achievement of target performance results in a reward adjustment of 90% of target (instead of 100%) and the achievement of maximum performance results in a reward adjustment of 150% of target (instead of 200%). This change also had the effect of reducing the overall reward leverage associated with performance shares subject to the 2023-2025 performance cycle from 250% of target to 187.5% of target. ● Performance-Vested Restricted Stock Units (40% of total LTI award) —These awards have the potential to vest at 0% to 200% of target in one-third increments during a three-year performance period based on AbbVie’s return on invested capital (ROIC) articulated as pre-set goals and measured relative to a group made up of companies that are constituents in either the S&P Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Life Science Index or the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. ● Non-Qualified Stock Options (20% of total LTI award) —These awards have the potential to vest in one-third increments on each of the first three annual anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued employment with the company. The option exercise price is set at or above fair market value on the grant date. To the extent that the options vest, the award expires ten years after the grant date. 2024 Proxy Statement | 47 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ Performance Share and Performance-Vested Restricted Stock Unit Performance Targets and Results Performance targets and results associated with the 2023 annual grant awards of performance shares and performance-vested restricted stock units are shown below.

(2) Due to the uncertainty associated with the timing of upfront and milestone payments, the financial goals established to evaluate management performance for purposes of incentive compensation exclude the impact of these payments. However, the performance goals shown in this table have been adjusted to account for upfront and milestone expenses in 2023 and the results include the impact of those payments. AbbVie granted performance shares in 2021 that were subject to a 3-year performance cycle that ended December 31, 2023.

These meeting dates generally are the third Thursday of February and are scheduled two years in advance. The grant price is the average of the highest and lowest trading prices of a common share on the date of the grant (rounded up to the next even penny). The grant price for the 2023 annual grant was $149.62. The high, low and closing prices of an AbbVie common share on the grant date (February 16, 2023) were $150.50, $148.73, and $149.53 respectively. All LTI awards are subject to a minimum vesting period of 12 months. BENEFITS Benefits are an important part of retention and capital preservation for all employees, helping to protect against the impact of unexpected catastrophic loss of health and/or earnings potential, as well as providing a means to save and accumulate for retirement or other post-employment needs. Each of the benefits described below supports the company’s objective of providing a market competitive total rewards program. Individual benefits do not directly affect decisions regarding other benefits or pay components, 48 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ except to the extent that all benefits and pay components must, in aggregate, be competitive, as previously discussed. Retirement Benefits The NEOs and other eligible U.S. employees participate in the AbbVie Pension Plan, the company’s principal qualified defined benefit plan. NEOs and certain other employees also participate in the AbbVie Supplemental Pension Plan. These plans are described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Pension Benefits.” The Supplemental Pension Plan is a non-qualified defined benefit plan that cannot be secured in a manner similar to a qualified plan, for which assets are held in trust, so eligible NEOs receive an annual cash payment equal to the increase in the present value of their Supplemental Pension Plan benefit. Eligible NEOs have the option of depositing the annual payment into an individually established grantor trust, net of tax withholdings. Deposited amounts may be credited with the difference between the NEO’s actual annual trust earnings and the rate used to calculate trust funding (currently 8 percent). Amounts deposited in the individual trusts are not tax-deferred and the NEOs personally pay the taxes on those amounts without gross-ups. The manner in which the grantor trust assets are to be distributed to an NEO upon retirement from the company generally follows the distribution method elected by the NEO under the AbbVie Pension Plan. If an NEO (or the NEO’s surviving spouse, depending on the pension distribution method elected by the NEO under the AbbVie Pension Plan) lives beyond the actuarial life expectancy age used to determine the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit, and therefore exhausts the trust balance, the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit will be paid to the NEO (or their surviving spouse) by AbbVie. Savings Plans The NEOs and other eligible U.S. employees are permitted to defer a portion of their annual base salary under the AbbVie Savings Plan, the company’s principal qualified defined contribution plan, up to the IRS contribution limits. Eligible NEOs also may defer up to 18 percent of their base salary, less contributions to the AbbVie Savings Plan, to the AbbVie Supplemental Savings Plan, which is a non-qualified defined contribution plan. Eligible NEOs may defer these amounts to unfunded book accounts or choose to have the amounts paid in cash on a current basis and deposited into individually established grantor trusts, net of tax withholdings. These amounts are credited annually with earnings. Amounts deposited in the individual trusts are not tax-deferred and the NEOs personally pay the taxes on those amounts without gross-ups. NEOs elect the manner in which the assets held in their grantor trusts will be distributed to them upon retirement or other separation from the company. These arrangements are described in greater detail in this proxy statement beginning with the section captioned “Summary Compensation Table.” Financial Planning NEOs are paid an annual stipend of $10,000 for estate planning advice, tax preparation and general financial planning fees. The stipend is income to the NEO, who is responsible for payment of all resulting taxes without gross-ups. Company-Provided Transportation NEOs are eligible for transportation perquisites that are designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their work, including the use of a company-leased vehicle and access to company-provided air travel, as appropriate. In some circumstances, these benefits may be used for personal travel, which would then be considered part of the NEO’s total compensation and treated as taxable income to them under applicable tax laws. The NEOs pay the taxes on such income without gross-ups. 2024 Proxy Statement | 49 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ Disability Benefits In addition to AbbVie’s standard disability benefits, NEOs are eligible for a monthly long-term disability benefit, which is described on page 70 of this proxy statement. EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AbbVie does not have employment agreements with any of its NEOs. CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENTS AbbVie has entered into change in control agreements with its NEOs to aid in retention and recruitment, encourage continued attention and dedication to assigned duties during periods involving a possible change in control of the company, and to protect the earned benefits of the NEOs against potential adverse changes resulting from a change in control. The change in control agreements contain a double-trigger feature, meaning that if the NEO’s employment is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability, or if the NEO elects to terminate employment for good reason, within two years following a change in control, they are entitled to receive certain pay and benefits as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control.” EXCISE TAX GROSS-UPS AbbVie does not provide excise tax gross-ups on NEO severance or other payments in connection with a change in control. Other Matters STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES AbbVie’s stock ownership guidelines are designed to further promote sustained stockholder return and to ensure the company’s senior executives remain focused on both short- and long-term objectives. Each senior executive has five years from the date of election or appointment to their position to achieve the ownership level associated with their position. NEOs are not allowed to sell stock, except for tax withholding at vesting or exercise, if they do not satisfy the minimum stock ownership requirement. The minimum stock ownership guidelines for the CEO and other NEOs are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Executive Stock Ownership Requirement Requirement Met? Richard A. Gonzalez ​ 6x Base Salary ​ Yes Robert A. Michael ​ 3x Base Salary ​ Yes Scott T. Reents ​ 3x Base Salary ​ Yes Jeffrey R. Stewart ​ 3x Base Salary ​ Yes Azita Saleki-Gerhardt ​ 3x Base Salary ​ Yes In addition, AbbVie’s non-employee directors are required to own AbbVie stock valued at five times (5x) the annual fee for service as a director under the AbbVie Non-Employee Directors’ Fee Plan within five years of joining the board or as soon as practicable thereafter. CLAWBACK POLICY The committee does not anticipate there would ever be circumstances where a restatement of earnings upon which any incentive plan award decisions were based would occur or circumstances where an executive officer engages in misconduct that would constitute a material breach of the AbbVie Code of Business Conduct. Nevertheless, the committee, in evaluating such circumstances, has broad discretion to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of stockholders, up to and including actions to recover incentive awards.  This includes a mandatory clawback of excess compensation in the event of a restatement, consistent with SEC rules, as well as broad authority to clawback compensation in the event of a material breach of the Code of Conduct.  For more 50 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ details, AbbVie’s Code of Business Conduct is available in the corporate governance section of AbbVie’s investor relations website at www.abbvieinvestor.com. ANTI-HEDGING AND ANTI-PLEDGING POLICIES AbbVie has a formal policy that prohibits directors and officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including all of the NEOs, from entering into or engaging in the purchase or sale of financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of AbbVie equity securities they hold. AbbVie also has a formal policy that prohibits directors and officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including all of the NEOs, from pledging AbbVie common stock as collateral for a loan. In addition, the AbbVie Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program provides that no long-term incentive award may be assigned, alienated, sold or transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or as permitted by the compensation committee for estate planning purposes, and no award and no right under any award may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered. All members of senior management, including the company’s NEOs and certain other employees, are required to clear any transaction involving company stock with the Legal department prior to entering into such transaction. Compensation Committee Report The compensation committee of the board of directors is primarily responsible for reviewing, approving and overseeing AbbVie’s compensation plans and practices, and works with management and the committee’s independent compensation consultant to establish AbbVie’s executive compensation philosophy and programs. The committee reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement. Compensation Committee R. Austin, Chair, T. Freyman, G. Tilton, and F. Waddell Compensation Risk Assessment During 2023, in collaboration with the compensation committee’s independent compensation consultant, AbbVie conducted an in-depth risk assessment of its compensation policies and practices, including those related to executive compensation programs for NEOs. The risk assessment included a quantitative and qualitative analysis of AbbVie’s executive compensation programs and broader employee incentive compensation plans. AbbVie also considered how these programs compare, from a design perspective, to programs maintained by other companies. Based on this assessment, it was determined that AbbVie’s executive compensation programs are balanced and appropriately incent employees, and any risks arising from the compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on AbbVie. The following factors were among those considered in making this determination: ● AbbVie is committed to pay equity and conducts pay equity analyses annually to ensure pay is equitable across genders and ethnicities among U.S. employees. ● AbbVie’s compensation structure contributes to a corporate culture that encourages our NEOs to regard AbbVie as a long-term employer. For example, equity awards vest over multi-year periods, which encourages NEOs to consider the long-term impact of their decisions and align their interests with those of AbbVie’s stockholders. ● AbbVie’s annual incentive program is based on multiple performance measures, balancing earnings achievement with other factors. Since earnings are a key component of stock price performance, this aspect of AbbVie’s compensation plan also promotes alignment with stockholder interests. ● AbbVie does not include certain pay design features that may have the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking, such as: over-weighting toward annual incentives, highly leveraged payout curves, unreasonable 2024 Proxy Statement | 51 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ thresholds or dramatic changes in payout opportunity at certain performance levels that may encourage inappropriate short-term business decisions to meet payout thresholds. In addition for 2023, a limit of 190% of target applies to any awards made under the NEO short-term incentive program. ● AbbVie’s annual long-term incentive program focuses NEOs on longer-term operating performance and aligns NEOs with stockholder interests through the use of multi-year performance periods and multiple performance measures, including relative total stockholder return. AbbVie’s NEOs received roughly two-thirds of their total direct compensation in the form of long-term incentives (20% of which are stock options that may vest over a three-year period and 80% of which are performance-based awards that may vest over a three-year performance period). ● AbbVie makes equity awards and sets grant prices at the same time each year, at the compensation committee’s regularly scheduled meeting in February. In addition, AbbVie does not award discounted stock options or immediately vested equity awards to NEOs. ● AbbVie has robust stock ownership guidelines for its senior executives, which promotes alignment with stockholder interests, and other good governance equity practices such as anti-hedging and anti-pledging policies. ● AbbVie’s compensation committee has the ability to exercise downward discretion in determining annual incentive plan payouts. ● AbbVie’s compensation committee is required to clawback excess compensation in the event of a restatement, plus retains broad discretion to clawback compensation in the event of a material breach of the Code of Conduct. ● AbbVie requires mandatory training on its code of conduct and policies and procedures to educate its employees on appropriate behaviors and the consequences of taking inappropriate actions. The risk assessment results were presented to the compensation committee by its independent compensation consultant. ​ 52 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ Summary Compensation Table This section contains compensation information for AbbVie’s NEOs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

AbbVie generally determines the grant date fair value of stock awards by multiplying the number of shares granted by the average of the high and low market prices of one share of AbbVie common stock on the award grant date. The grant date fair value of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. (2) In accordance with SEC rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. These amounts were determined as of the option grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. These amounts are being reported solely for the purpose of comparative disclosure in accordance with the SEC rules. There is no certainty that the amount determined using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model would be the value, if any, eventually realized by the NEO.

The amounts shown below beside each NEO’s name are for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, as applicable. AbbVie Pension Plan R. Gonzalez: $927 / $(48,867) / $(9,939); R. Michael: $119,233 / $(269,837) / $30,894; S. Reents: $90,112 / $(11,195); J. Stewart: $277,907 / $(263,944) / $37,175; and A. Saleki-Gerhardt: $190,794 / $(202,627). ​ AbbVie Supplemental Pension Plan R. Gonzalez: $(154,979) / $(3,814,003) / $(1,096,337); R. Michael: $2,776,666 / $(1,162,821) / $2,494,946; S. Reents: $1,627,895 / $893,948; J. Stewart: $4,918,891 / $(1,248,100) / $1,899,249; and A. Saleki-Gerhardt: $1,462,884 / $(1,289,139). The changes in pension value result primarily from the following factors: (i) the effect of changes in the actuarial assumptions AbbVie uses to calculate plan liability for financial reporting purposes; (ii) additional pension benefit accrual under the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan; and (iii) the impact of the time value of money on the pension value. Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan Earnings The totals in this column include reportable interest credited under the AbbVie Performance Incentive Plan and the AbbVie Supplemental Savings Plan. R. Gonzalez: $1,331,617 / $439,214 / $780,933; R. Michael: $123,213 / $1,607; S. Reents: $294,882 / $79,768; J. Stewart: $594,880 / $179,792 / $276,474; and A. Saleki-Gerhardt: $707,787 / $223,236. (5) The amounts shown in this column include the change in pension value during the applicable year, which is attributable to changes in actuarial assumptions (primarily discount rate and mortality tables) and other factors based on plan design (primarily pay, service and age). The present value of a pension benefit is determined, in part, by the discount rate used for accounting purposes. The discount rate is determined by reference to the prevailing market rate of interest. In 2023, interest rates decreased and the discount rates used for the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan were decreased to reflect that change. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of participants’ pension benefits while actual monthly payments to be made to participants are not changed. The discount rate used for 2023 was 5.14% for the Pension Plan and 5.12% for the Supplemental Pension Plan. The discount rate used for 2022 was 5.32% for the Pension Plan and 5.30% for the Supplemental Pension Plan. The discount rate used for 2021 was 3.25% for the Pension Plan and 3.21% for the Supplemental Pension Plan. The mortality assumptions that apply for actuarial purposes also affect pension values. In addition to the effect of the changes in actuarial assumptions, the change in pension value reflects the application of the benefit formulas under the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan, which are described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Pension Benefits.” As participants’ pay changes, the formulas yield revised pension values. Furthermore, as a participant ages and service credit accumulates year over year (before the participant is eligible for unreduced pension benefits), the present value of their pension benefits increases, even without changes in pay or actuarial assumptions. (6) The amounts shown below are reported in this column for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as applicable. Earnings for Non-Qualified Defined Benefit and Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plans R. Gonzalez: $1,227,973 / $358,975 / $130,314; R. Michael: $4,438; S. Reents: $229,677 / $65,517; J.

The annual cash incentive award earned by the NEO in 2023 under the plan is shown in the Summary Compensation Table in the column captioned “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.” No future pay-outs will be made with respect to the 2023 awards under the plan. The plan is described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Plan Elements—Short-Term Incentives.” (2) This is a performance share award that has the potential to vest at 0% to 187.5% of target during a three-year performance period based on company performance in earnings per share (EPS) and relative total stockholder return (TSR). TSR performance is measured relative to a group made up of companies that are constituents in either the S&P Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Life Science Index or the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid in cash at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. In 2023, AbbVie’s EPS performance resulted in the banking of the award on February 28, 2024 at 150% of target, with vesting to be determined based on the company’s relative TSR performance following the three-year performance period that ends December 31, 2025. The performance metrics are described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Plan Elements—Long-Term Incentives.” (3) This is a performance-vested restricted stock unit award that has the potential to vest at 0% to 200% of target, in one-third increments, during a three-year performance period based on AbbVie’s return on invested capital (ROIC) articulated as pre-set goals and measured relative to a group made up of companies that are constituents in either the S&P Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Life Science Index or the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid in cash at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. In 2023, AbbVie’s relative ROIC performance resulted in the vesting on February 28, 2024 of one-third of the award at 200% of target. The performance metrics are described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Plan Elements—Long-Term Incentives.” 56 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ (4) The grant date fair value of stock awards is generally determined by multiplying the number of shares or units granted by the average of the high and low market prices of one share of AbbVie common stock on the award grant date. The grant date fair value of performance shares with a TSR market condition is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. In the event of a grantee’s death or termination due to disability, these awards will be deemed earned either based on actual performance through the date of death or disability or at target, depending on the timing of the death or disability, as set forth in the award agreement. Upon a change in control, the treatment of these awards is determined as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control—Equity Awards.” (5) One-third of the shares of common stock covered by these options are exercisable after one year, two-thirds after two years, and all after three years, subject to satisfaction of the service requirements set forth in the award agreements. The options vest in the event of the grantee’s death or termination due to disability. Upon a change in control, the treatment of these awards is determined as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control—Equity Awards.” Under the AbbVie Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program, these options have an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low market prices (rounded up to the next even penny) of one share of AbbVie common stock on the date of grant. (6) The grant date fair value of option awards is determined as of the option grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. The assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value are described in footnote (2) to the Summary Compensation Table. 2024 Proxy Statement | 57 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ 2023 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End The following table summarizes the outstanding AbbVie equity awards held by the NEOs at year end. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Option Awards(1) ​ ​ Stock Awards ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity ​ ​ Incentive ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Incentive ​ ​ Plan Awards: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Plan Awards: ​ ​ Market or ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Number of ​ ​ Payout Value ​ ​ Number of ​ Number of ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Market ​ Unearned ​ ​ of Unearned ​ ​ Securities ​ Securities ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Number of ​ Value of ​ Shares ​ ​ Shares ​ ​ Underlying ​ Underlying ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Shares of ​ Shares of ​ or Other ​ ​ or Other ​ ​ Unexercised ​ Unexercised ​ Option ​ Option ​ ​ Stock That ​ Stock That ​ Rights That ​ ​ Rights That ​ ​ Options -(#) ​ Options -(#) ​ Exercise ​ Expiration ​ ​ Have Not ​ Have Not ​ Have Not ​ ​ Have Not Name Exercisable Unexercisable Price -($) Date Vested -(#) Vested -($) Vested -(#) ​ Vested -($) R.

Except as provided in AbbVie’s change in control agreements, AbbVie does not have a policy granting extra years of credited service under the plans. The change in control agreements are described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control.” The compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the NEOs is the compensation shown in the “Salary” and “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” columns of the Summary Compensation Table. PENSION PLAN The Pension Plan is a broad-based plan that covers many AbbVie employees in the United States, age 21 or older, and provides participants with a life annuity benefit at normal retirement equal to A plus the greater of B or C below. A. 1.10% of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service after 2003. B. 1.65% of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004 (up to 20); plus 1.50% of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004 in excess of 20 (but no more than 15 additional years); less 0.50% of the lesser of 3-year final average earnings (but not more than the social security wage base in any year) or the social security covered compensation level multiplied by years of benefit service. C. 1.10% of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004. The benefit for service prior to 2004 (B or C above) is reduced for the cost of preretirement surviving spouse benefit protection. The reduction is calculated using formulas based on age and employment status during the period in which coverage was in effect. Final average earnings are the average of the employee’s 60 highest-paid consecutive calendar months of compensation (salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation). The Pension Plan covers earnings up to the limit imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) and provides for a maximum of 35 years of benefit service. Participants become fully vested in their pension benefit upon the completion of five years of service. The benefit is payable on an unreduced basis at age 65. Employees hired after 2003 who terminate employment prior to age 55 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis 2024 Proxy Statement | 61 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ as early as age 55. Employees hired before 2004 who terminate employment prior to age 50 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 50. Employees hired before 2004 who terminate employment prior to age 50 with fewer than 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. The Pension Plan offers several optional forms of payment, including certain and life annuities, joint and survivor annuities, and level income annuities. The benefit paid under any of these options is actuarially equivalent to the life annuity benefit produced by the formula described above. Employees who retire from AbbVie prior to their normal retirement age may receive subsidized early retirement benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are eligible for early retirement at age 55 with 10 years of service. Employees hired before 2004 are eligible for early retirement at age 50 with 10 years of service or age 55 if the employee’s age plus years of benefit service total 70 or more. Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Michael, Mr. Reents, Dr. Saleki-Gerhardt, and Mr. Stewart are eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. The subsidized early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service after 2003 (A above) depend upon the participant’s age at retirement. If the participant retires after reaching age 55, the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. If the participant retires after reaching age 50 but prior to reaching age 55, the benefit is actuarially reduced from age 65. The early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service prior to 2004 (B and C above) depend upon age and service at retirement: ● In general, the 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit are reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62 and the 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. ● Employees who participated in the plan before age 36 may elect “Special Retirement” on the last day of any month after reaching age 55 with age plus Seniority Service points of at least 94 or “Early Special Retirement” on the last day of any month after reaching age 55, provided their age plus Seniority Service points would reach at least 94 before age 65. Seniority Service includes periods of employment prior to attaining the minimum age required to participate in the plan. If Special Retirement or Early Special Retirement applies, Seniority Service is used in place of benefit service in the formulas. The 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit in B above are reduced 1 2 / 3 percent for each year between ages 59 and 62 plus 2 1 / 2 percent for each year between ages 55 and 59. The 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. Benefit C is payable on an unreduced basis at Special Retirement and is reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62, if Early Special Retirement applies. SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN The provisions of the Supplemental Pension Plan (which covers AbbVie employees in the United States whose compensation exceeds certain limits under the Internal Revenue Code) are substantially the same as those of the Pension Plan, with the following exceptions: ● Participants’ 5-year final average earnings are calculated using the average of the 5 highest years of base earnings and the 5 highest years of payments under AbbVie’s non-equity incentive plans. ● The Pension Plan does not include amounts deferred or payments received under the AbbVie Deferred Compensation Plan in its calculation of a participant’s final average earnings. To preserve the pension benefits of Deferred Compensation Plan participants, the Supplemental Pension Plan includes amounts deferred by a participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan in its calculation of final average earnings. ● In addition to the benefits outlined above for the Pension Plan, the NEOs are eligible for an additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefit equal to 0.6% of 5-year final average earnings for each year of service for each of the first 20 years of service occurring after the participant attains age 35. The benefit is further limited by the maximum percentage allowed under the Pension Plan under that plan’s benefit formulas (A, B and C above). The portion of this additional benefit attributable to service before 2004 is reduced 3 percent per year 62 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ for each year that payments are made before age 60. The portion attributable to service after 2003 is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 60 if the participant is at least age 55 at early retirement. If the participant is under age 55 at retirement, the portion attributable to service after 2003 is actuarially reduced from age 65. ● The Supplemental Pension Plan provides early retirement benefits similar to those provided under the Pension Plan. The benefits provided to NEOs under the Supplemental Pension Plan are not, however, reduced for the period between age 60 and age 62, unless the benefit is being actuarially reduced from age 65. Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Michael, Mr. Reents, Dr. Saleki-Gerhardt, and Mr. Stewart are eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. ● Vested benefits accrued under the Supplemental Pension Plan may be funded through a grantor trust established by an eligible NEO. Consistent with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, an eligible NEO who became an officer prior to 2009 may have the entire amount of their vested plan benefits funded through a grantor trust. An eligible NEO who became an officer after 2008 may have only the vested benefits that accrue following the calendar year in which they are first elected as an officer funded through a grantor trust. Benefits payable under the Supplemental Pension Plan are offset by the benefits payable from the Pension Plan, calculated as if benefits under the plans commenced at the same time. The amounts paid to an eligible NEO’s Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust to fund plan benefits are actuarially determined. The plan is designed to result in AbbVie paying the eligible NEO’s Supplemental Pension Plan benefits to the extent assets held in their trust are insufficient.

(2) The plan permits participants to defer up to 75% of their base salary and up to 75% of their annual cash incentives and credits a participant’s account with an amount equal to the employer matching contributions that otherwise would have been made for the participant under AbbVie’s tax-qualified defined contribution plan. Participants may direct the investment of their deferral accounts into one or more of several funds chosen by the administrator, and the deferral account is credited with investment returns based on the performance of the fund(s) selected. During 2023, the weighted average rate of return credited to the account was 8.6% for Mr. Stewart and 20.7% for Dr. Saleki-Gerhardt. The plan provides for cash distributions in either a lump sum or installments after separation from service and permits in-service withdrawals in accordance with specific procedures. Participants make distribution elections each year that apply to the deferrals to be made in the following calendar year, in accordance with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.

The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. The ratio of Mr. Gonzalez’s annual total compensation for 2023, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement, to the median employee annual total compensation determined on the same basis was 169:1. For 2023, the annual total compensation of our median employee (other than Mr. Gonzalez) was $151,991 . To identify the median employee, we prepared a list of active AbbVie employees, throughout the world as of December 31, 202 3. The consistently applied compensation measure used to identify the median employee was annual base pay and target bonus, using hours worked during 2023 for hourly employees and base salary for the remaining employees. This process resulted in a median group consisting of several employees and a representative employee was selected, taking into account demographic characteristics that we believe best represent a typical AbbVie employee, including tenure, location, employment status and applicable compensation and benefit programs. ​ REQUIRED PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE As required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, the table below includes information to demonstrate the relationship between NEO compensation and certain financial performance measures for fiscal years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The dollar amounts do not reflect the actual amount of compensation earned by or paid to Mr. Gonzalez during such fiscal years and are based on valuation assumptions required by the SEC, which are unlikely to reflect actual amounts realized at vesting or exercise (as applicable). In accordance with the requirements of Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, the reported “Total” in the Summary Compensation Table for the applicable year is adjusted to determine the “compensation actually paid” amount as follows: ​ (1) The amount reflected in the “Stock Award” and “Option Award” columns of the Summary Compensation Table with respect to Mr. Gonzalez has been deducted from the Summary Compensation Table Total and substituted with an equity award value for each year calculated by adding or subtracting, as applicable, the following: (i) the year-end fair value of any equity awards granted in the applicable fiscal year that are outstanding and unvested as of the end of such year, accounting for any banking of the award resulting from EPS performance (as reflected in footnote (2) to the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End Table); (ii) the change in fair value from the end of the prior fiscal year of any awards granted in prior fiscal years that are outstanding and unvested as of the end of the applicable fiscal year, accounting for any adjustment based on relative TSR performance on awards for which the performance 2024 Proxy Statement | 65 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ period ends as of this date (as reflected in footnote (2) to the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End Table); (iii) for awards granted in prior fiscal years that vested in the applicable fiscal year, the amount equal to the change in value as of the vesting date (from the end of the prior fiscal year); and (iv) the dollar value of dividends accrued on equity awards in the applicable year prior to the vesting date (excluding option awards, which do not carry dividend equivalent rights) that are not otherwise reflected in the fair value of such award or included in any other component of total compensation for the applicable fiscal year. The valuation assumptions used to calculate fair values on equity awards other than options are the same as those disclosed at the time of grant.  Stock option awards are valued using a Black-Scholes model at the time of grant (as disclosed in footnote (2) to the Summary Compensation Table on page 53) with subsequent fair value calculations performed using a Lattice model. ​ The amounts in the following table represent each of the amounts deducted and added to the equity award values for Mr. Gonzalez for the 2023 fiscal year for purposes of computing the “compensation actually paid” amount appearing in column (b) of the pay versus performance table: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Grant Date ​ Year-end ​ Change in ​ Change in ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Equity ​ Fair Value of ​ Fair Value of ​ Fair Value as of ​ Fair Value as of ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Value ​ Equity Awards ​ Equity Awards ​ Year-End of Any ​ the Vesting Date ​ Total ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Reflected in ​ Granted ​ Granted ​ Prior Year ​ of Any Prior Year ​ Equity Value ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Summary ​ During ​ During ​ Awards that ​ Awards that ​ Reflected in ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Compensation ​ Applicable ​ Applicable ​ Remain Unvested ​ Vested During ​ Compensation Year ​ ​ PEO Name ​ Table ​ Year ​ Year ​ as of Year-End ​ Applicable Year ​ Actually Paid 2023 ​ ​ Richard A.

Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure that represents diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude certain specified items, as described in Appendix B. ​ Comparative Analysis of the Pay versus Performance Table AbbVie’s compensation program is designed to attract and retain executives whose talents and contributions sustain long-term growth by aligning their interests with the drivers of stockholder returns and supporting their achievement of AbbVie’s primary business goals.  AbbVie considers several performance measures to ensure executives are incentivized to accomplish these objectives, many of which are not presented in the pay versus performance table.  The charts and descriptions below explain the relationship between the columns presented in the pay versus performance table. ​ 2024 Proxy Statement | 67 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ AbbVie TSR versus Peer Group TSR The graph below shows AbbVie’s cumulative TSR over the four-year period ending with December 31, 2023 as compared to the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. AbbVie’s cumulative TSR outperformed our peer group during the four years presented in the table. Additionally, AbbVie is committed to a robust return of capital to stockholders with an increase of 285% in its quarterly dividend since 2013 as part of a balanced and disciplined capital allocation program, contributing to our strong cumulative TSR. ​ Comparison of “Compensation Actually Paid” to TSR The chart below demonstrates that the “compensation actually paid” amounts shown for Mr. Gonzalez and average “compensation actually paid” to the other NEOs is aligned with AbbVie’s cumulative TSR over the four years presented in the pay versus performance table. The alignment of compensation actually paid with AbbVie’s cumulative TSR over the period presented reflects that a significant portion of the compensation actually paid to Mr. Gonzalez and to the other NEOs is comprised of equity awards. Moreover, AbbVie’s executive compensation philosophy and design is fundamentally based on a commitment to align pay and performance. 68 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ Comparison of “Compensation Actually Paid” to Net Income AbbVie’s net income was approximately $4.6 billion in 2020, $11.5 billion in 2021, $11.8 billion in 2022 and $4.9 billion in 2023.  Mr. Gonzalez’s “compensation actually paid” was approximately $47 million, $66 million, $67 million and $35 million in the corresponding years and the average “compensation actually paid” to AbbVie’s other NEOs was approximately $22.5 million, $24 million, $20 million and $12 million in each of those years, respectively. The changes in AbbVie’s net income over the four years presented in the pay versus performance table reflect general alignment with the “compensation actually paid” to Mr. Gonzalez and the other NEOs (on average) and AbbVie's net income during this period. ​ Comparison of “Compensation Actually Paid” to Company-Selected Measure (Adjusted Diluted EPS) AbbVie’s annualized adjusted diluted EPS was $9.76 in 2020, $11.83 in 2021, $13.77 in 2022 and $11.11 in 2023.  Mr. Gonzalez’s “compensation actually paid” was approximately $47 million, $66 million, $67 million and $35 million in the corresponding years and the average “compensation actually paid” to AbbVie’s other NEOs was approximately $22.5 million, $24 million, $20 million and $12 million in each of those years, respectively. While AbbVie uses numerous financial and non-financial performance measures for the purpose of evaluating performance for our compensation programs, we have determined that adjusted diluted EPS is the financial performance measure that, in AbbVie’s assessment, represents the most important performance measure (that is not otherwise required to be disclosed in the table) used to link compensation actually paid to NEOs, for the most recently completed fiscal year, to AbbVie’s performance.  AbbVie places significant emphasis on achieving positive EPS outcomes because it reflects strong operating dynamics in the underlying business, which is imperative for sustained long-term growth. ​ Most Important Performance Measures The performance measures that AbbVie uses in our executive compensation program are selected based on the objective of incentivizing NEOs to achieve long-term, sustainable growth in stockholder value.  As required by 2024 Proxy Statement | 69 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we have identified the following financial performance measures as being the most important in linking actual compensation paid to executives to AbbVie’s performance. ​ ​ Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Adjusted Relative Return on Invested Capital Adjusted Return on Assets Non-GAAP Income Before Taxes Non-GAAP Operating Margin Platform Revenue Total Shareholder Return ​ Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION – GENERALLY In accordance with AbbVie’s longstanding practice, the company has not entered into employment agreements with its NEOs.  NEOs do not have any rights or entitlements to any cash termination or severance payments or equity vesting acceleration outside of the change in control context and subsequent termination of an NEO (double trigger), as discussed in more detail below. The following summarizes the payments that the NEOs would have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2023. Earnings would have continued to be paid for the NEO’s Performance Incentive Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan grantor trusts, as applicable, until the trust assets were fully distributed. The amount of these payments would depend on the trust earnings and fees and the period over which the trust assets were distributed. Based on current earnings rates, if the trust assets were distributed over a 10-year period, the NEOs would receive the following average annual earnings payments over such 10-year period: Mr. Gonzalez, $2,332,769; Mr. Michael, $413,772; Mr. Reents, $623,496; Mr. Stewart, $1,173,818; and Dr. Saleki-Gerhardt, $1,317,555. In addition, the following one-time deposits would have been made under the AbbVie Supplemental Pension Plan for each of the following NEOs, respectively: Mr. Gonzalez, $0; Mr. Michael, $8,866,500; Mr. Reents, $4,944,837; Mr. Stewart, $5,397,426; and Dr. Saleki-Gerhardt, $1,609,949. As of December 31, 2023, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Michael, Mr. Reents, Mr. Stewart, and Dr. Saleki-Gerhardt were eligible to retire, and therefore were eligible to receive the pension benefits previously described. If the termination of employment had been due to disability, then the respective NEO also would have received, in addition to AbbVie’s standard disability benefits, a monthly long-term disability benefit in the following amount: Mr. Gonzalez, $175,000; Mr. Michael, $150,000; Mr. Reents, $92,500; Mr. Stewart, $126,250; and Dr. Saleki-Gerhardt, $92,500. This long-term disability benefit would continue for up to 24 months following termination of employment. It ends if the NEO retires, recovers, dies or ceases to meet eligibility criteria. If the NEO’s employment had terminated due to death or disability, their unvested stock options, restricted stock unit awards and performance shares would have vested on December 31, 2023 with values as set forth below in the subsection of this proxy statement captioned “Equity Awards.” POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL AbbVie has entered into change in control agreements with its NEOs. Each change in control agreement continues in effect until December 31, 2027, and can be renewed for successive five-year terms upon notice prior to the expiration date. If notice of non-renewal is given, the agreement will expire on the later of the scheduled expiration date and the one-year anniversary of the date of such notice. If no notice is given, the agreement will expire on the one- year anniversary of the scheduled expiration date. Each agreement also automatically extends for two years following any change in control (see below) that occurs while the agreement is in effect.  As discussed in more detail below, AbbVie’s internal policies and individual change in control agreements with its NEOs prohibit a cash lump sum payment in excess of 2.99 times an NEO’s annual salary and bonus, unless shareholders ratify an exception. 70 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ The agreements provide that if the employee is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the employee elects to terminate employment for good reason (see below) within two years following a change in control, they are entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to 2.99 their annual salary and annual incentive (“bonus”) award (assuming for this purpose that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and the pro rata bonus for any current bonus period (based on the highest of the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, the average bonus for the past three years or, in the case of the unpaid bonus for any completed performance period, the actual bonus earned). If the employee is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability during a potential change in control (see below), they are entitled to receive a lump sum payment of the annual salary and bonus payments described above, except that the amount of the bonus to which the employee is entitled will be based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance goals. If the potential change in control becomes a “change in control event” (within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A), the employee will be entitled to receive the difference between the bonus amounts the employee received upon termination during the potential change in control and the bonus amounts that would have been received had such amounts instead been based on the higher of the employee’s target bonus or the average bonus paid to the employee in the preceding three years. Bonus payments include payments made under the Performance Incentive Plan. The employee also will receive up to two years of additional employee benefits (including welfare benefits, outplacement services and tax and financial counseling) and the value of three more years of pension accruals. If change in control-related payments and benefits become subject to the excise tax imposed under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999, payments under the agreement will be reduced to prevent application of the excise tax if such a reduction would leave the employee in a better after-tax position than if the payments were not reduced and the tax applied. The agreements also limit the conduct for which awards under AbbVie’s incentive stock programs can be terminated and generally permit options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term. For purposes of the agreements, the term “change in control” includes the following events: any person becoming the beneficial owner of AbbVie securities representing 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting power (not including an acquisition directly from AbbVie and its affiliates); a change in the majority of the members of the board of directors whose appointment was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the incumbent directors; and the consummation of certain mergers or similar corporate transactions involving AbbVie. A “potential change in control” under the agreements includes, among other things, AbbVie’s entry into an agreement that would result in a change in control. Finally, the term “good reason” includes: a significant adverse change in the employee’s position, duties, or authority; the company’s failure to pay the employee’s compensation or a reduction in the employee’s base pay or benefits; or the relocation of the company’s principal executive offices to a location that is more than 35 miles from the location of the offices at the time of the change in control. If a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2023, immediately followed by one of the covered circumstances described above, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Michael, Mr. Reents, Mr. Stewart, and Dr. Saleki-Gerhardt would have been entitled to receive the following payments and benefits under the change in control agreements: ● Mr. Gonzalez: cash termination payments—$19,863,185; additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits—$0; welfare and fringe benefits—$86,488. ● Mr. Michael: cash termination payments—$11,711,456; additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits—$8,866,500; welfare and fringe benefits—$90,470. ● Mr. Reents: cash termination payments—$6,279,000; additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits—$4,944,837; welfare and fringe benefits—$72,383. ● Mr. Stewart: cash termination payments—$9,073,861; additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits—$5,397,426; welfare and fringe benefits—$89,522. ● Dr. Saleki-Gerhardt: cash termination payments—$7,623,982; additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits—$1,609,949; welfare and fringe benefits—$68,685. ​ Because the termination date is assumed to occur at the end of the 2023 performance period, the cash termination payments include an amount reflecting the excess, if any, of (a) the bonus entitlement under the change in control agreements, which would be based on the higher of target performance and the average bonus 2024 Proxy Statement | 71 Table of Contents ​ ​ EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ for the past three years, over (b) the actual bonus earned by the NEO for the 2023 performance period, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table in the column captioned “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.” EQUITY AWARDS The AbbVie Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program was approved by AbbVie’s stockholders and covers approximately 16,000 participants, including a broad group of management and professional staff. The NEO award agreements under the AbbVie Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program provide that the award may be assumed, converted or replaced on an equivalent basis by the surviving company upon a change in control. If the surviving company does not do so, the vesting of the awards is accelerated. If the surviving company does assume, convert or replace the awards on an equivalent basis, then accelerated vesting of the awards is limited to circumstances in which, during the period from six months before through two years after a change in control, the grantee’s employment is terminated without cause or the grantee resigns for good reason. The terms “cause” and “good reason” have the same definitions as in the change in control agreements. If a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2023 and the surviving company did not assume, convert or replace any of the awards, or the surviving company did so and the NEO’s employment had terminated without cause or they had resigned for good reason, as described above, then the unvested equity awards of the NEOs would have vested as follows: ● Mr. Gonzalez would have vested in (i) 284,047 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $4,858,201, (ii) 149,432 AbbVie restricted stock units with a value of $24,535,404, and (iii) 279,263 AbbVie performance shares with a value of $46,499,683. ● Mr. Michael would have vested in (i) 99,423 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $1,645,011, (ii) 52,495 AbbVie restricted stock units with a value of $8,600,769, and (iii) 96,418 AbbVie performance shares with a value of $16,029,178. ● Mr. Reents would have vested in (i) 46,523 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $513,593, (ii) 31,484 AbbVie restricted stock units with a value of $5,043,356, and (iii) 36,526 AbbVie performance shares with a value of $5,979,346. ● Mr. Stewart would have vested in (i) 74,413 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $1,157,445, (ii) 52,942 AbbVie restricted stock units with a value of $8,542,284, and (iii) 69,182 AbbVie performance shares with a value of $11,479,726. ● Dr. Saleki-Gerhardt would have vested in (i) 60,385 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $1,056,886, (ii) 45,583 AbbVie restricted stock units with a value of $7,362,463, and (iii) 60,119 AbbVie performance shares with a value of $10,019,440. ​ The value of stock options shown is based on the excess of the closing price of one share of common stock on December 29, 2023 over the exercise price of such options, multiplied by the number of unvested stock options held by the NEO. The value of restricted stock units and performance shares shown is determined by multiplying the number of units or shares (at target level for performance-based awards) that would vest as of December 31, 2023 in accordance with the applicable equity award agreement terms and the closing price of one share of common stock on December 29, 2023.  The value of restricted stock units and performance shares also includes the value of accrued dividends as of December 31, 2023, which would be paid at vesting. ​ 72 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents RATIFICATION OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS ABBVIE’S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ​ ​ What am I voting on and how should I vote? You are being asked to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP to perform independent audit services for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. Ernst & Young LLP has served as our independent auditor since 2013. The board and the audit committee believe it is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders to retain Ernst & Young LLP as the company’s independent auditor. The board of directors therefore recommends you vote “FOR” ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as AbbVie’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2024 . The audit committee of the board of directors is directly responsible for the appointment, fees, retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the company’s financial statements. On October 11, 2023, the audit committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP (the independent auditor) to perform independent audit services for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. Ernst & Young LLP has served as our independent auditor since 2013. In conjunction with the periodic mandated rotation of the audit firm’s lead engagement partner, the chair of the audit committee would be involved in the selection of a new lead engagement partner. Further, the audit committee will periodically consider whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent auditor. Although the audit committee has sole authority to appoint the independent auditor, it would like to know the opinion of the stockholders regarding its appointment of Ernst & Young LLP for 2024. For this reason, stockholders are being asked to ratify this appointment. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP for 2024, the audit committee will take that fact into consideration, but may, nevertheless, continue to retain Ernst & Young LLP. The audit committee and the board believe that the continued retention of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the company’s independent auditor is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. ​ ​ 2024 Proxy Statement | 73 Table of Contents AUDIT INFORMATION Audit Fees and Non-Audit Fees The following table presents fees for professional audit services rendered to AbbVie by Ernst & Young LLP for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and fees for other services rendered to AbbVie by Ernst & Young LLP for those periods. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2023 ​ 2022 ​ (millions) (millions) Audit fees: (1) ​ $ 19.7 ​ $ 20.3 Audit related fees: (2) ​ 0.5 ​ 0.5 Tax fees: (3) ​ 3.4 ​ 5.2 Other fees: (4) ​ 0.4 ​ 0.6 Total ​ $ 24.0 ​ $ 26.6 (1) Ernst & Young LLP billed or will bill AbbVie for professional services rendered for the audit of AbbVie’s annual financial statements, the review of AbbVie’s financial statements included in AbbVie’s quarterly reports, the audits of AbbVie’s internal control over financial reporting, statutory and subsidiary audits required internationally, the review of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, comfort letters, consents and certain accounting consultations in connection with the audits. (2) Audit related fees include audits of certain employee benefit plan financial statements, accounting consultations in connection with proposed or pending transactions, and other audit or agreed upon procedures required by statute or regulation not classified as audit fees. (3) Tax fees consist principally of professional services for corporate tax compliance and tax advisory services. (4) Other fees principally relate to financial advisory services for immaterial international affiliates and information technology assessment services. Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The audit committee has established policies and procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm (the independent auditor) and its related affiliates. Prior to engagement of the independent auditor for the next year’s audit, management will submit a schedule of all proposed permissible services expected to be rendered during that year for each of four categories of services to the audit committee for approval. Prior to engagement, the audit committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the audit committee requires the independent auditor and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent auditor for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the audit committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent auditor. The audit committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the audit committee at its next scheduled meeting. 74 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ bn ​ AUDIT INFORMATION ​ Audit Committee Report The audit committee is comprised of six non-employee members of the board of directors.  Each audit committee member meets the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. The committee operates under a written charter adopted by the board of directors. Consistent with the responsibilities set forth in its charter, the audit committee assists the board of directors in its oversight of AbbVie’s accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices. The audit committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K with AbbVie’s management and its independent registered public accounting firm (the independent auditor). Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of AbbVie’s consolidated financial statements. The independent auditor is responsible for performing an audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The audit committee reviews these processes on behalf of the board of directors.  Periodically, during the year, the audit committee reviewed and discussed with AbbVie’s management, internal auditors, and independent auditor the effectiveness of AbbVie’s internal control over financial reporting and the overall quality of AbbVie’s financial reporting. The audit committee has discussed with the independent auditor the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the audit committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor regarding its independence required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB, and has discussed with the independent auditor the firm’s independence. The audit committee has also considered whether the provision of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent auditor and concluded the independent auditor’s independence has not been impaired. Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in AbbVie’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Waddell ​ ​ 2024 Proxy Statement | 75 Table of Contents SAY ON PAY—ADVISORY VOTE ON THE APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ What am I voting on and how should I vote? You are being asked to approve the compensation of AbbVie’s named executive officers described in the Executive Compensation section of this proxy statement. This vote is non-binding. The board will take the results into account when making future compensation decisions. The compensation committee has thoroughly reviewed the company’s compensation program and has determined that the pay decisions for the named executive officers are appropriate given the company’s performance, the executives’ contributions, and our stockholders’ interests. The board of directors therefore recommends you vote “FOR” the approval of the named executive officers’ compensation . As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, stockholders are being asked to approve the compensation of AbbVie’s named executive officers, as disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related material included in this proxy statement. The independent compensation committee of the board of directors, with the counsel of its independent compensation consultant, has thoroughly examined AbbVie’s programs, the company’s performance related to our industry and peer group, and market factors. The committee has determined that the specific pay decisions for the named executive officers are appropriate given the company’s performance, the executives’ contributions, and our stockholders’ interests.  We currently ask our stockholders to vote on executive compensation on an annual basis. While this vote is advisory and non-binding, the board of directors and the compensation committee value the opinion of the stockholders and will review the voting results and take them into account when future compensation decisions are made. ​ ​ 76 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents SAY WHEN ON PAY—ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF FUTURE APPROVALS OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ​ ​ What am I voting on and how should I vote? Section 14A of the Exchange Act provides stockholders the opportunity to vote, on an advisory and non-binding basis, their preference as to the frequency of future advisory approvals of named executive officer compensation. This vote is often referred to as ‘‘say when on pay.’’ Stockholders can vote on whether future advisory approvals of named executive officer compensation should occur every year, every two years or every three years, or they can abstain from voting. The board of directors recommends that you vote for a vote to approve the named executive officers’ compensation every 1 YEAR . ​ AbbVie’s first ‘‘say when on pay’’ advisory vote occurred in 2013 and resulted in approximately 80% support for annual advisory approvals of named executive officer compensation. Our next vote occurred in 2018 and resulted in approximately 97% support for annual advisory approvals of named executive officers’ compensation. While this vote is advisory and non-binding, the board of directors and the compensation committee value the opinion of the stockholders and will review the voting results and take them into account. ​ 2024 Proxy Statement | 77 Table of Contents ​ ​ MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING ​ ​ MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING ​ ​ What am I voting on and how should I vote? You are being asked to amend and restate the Certificate of Incorporation to remove the supermajority voting requirement. Currently, certain amendments to the company’s Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws require the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of the outstanding shares.  The proposed amendment will allow for a regular majority to pass such amendments in the future. The board of directors therefore recommends you vote “FOR” the management proposal to amend and restate the Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate supermajority voting. Currently, AbbVie’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) provides that certain amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation or AbbVie’s Amended and Restated By-Laws (the “By-Laws”) require the affirmative vote of shares representing no less than 80 percent of AbbVie’s outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. We refer to these provisions listed below as the “Supermajority Voting Requirement.” Specifically, Article VIII of the Certificate of Incorporation provides that any stockholder-approved alteration, amendment, or repeal of any of the By-Law provisions listed below, or the adoption of any stockholder-approved By-Law provision inconsistent with those By-Law provisions, must be approved pursuant to the Supermajority Voting Requirement. The By-Law provisions covered by the Supermajority Voting Requirement are in regards to: ● special meetings of stockholders and written consents by stockholders (Article II, Sections 2.2 and 2.12, respectively); ● board size and tenure, classes of directors, board vacancies, and director removal (Article III, Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.10 and 3.11, respectively); ● indemnification of directors and officers (Article VII); and ● amendments to the By-Laws (Article X). Article XI of the Certificate of Incorporation provides that any alteration, amendment, or repeal of any of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation listed below, or the adoption of any provision inconsistent with those provisions, must be approved pursuant to the Supermajority Voting Requirement. The provisions covered by the Supermajority Voting Requirement are in regards to: ● board size, classes of directors, board vacancies, and director removal (Article VI, Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively); and ● written consents by stockholders and special meetings of stockholders (Article VII, Sections 1 and 2, respectively). After reviewing the advantages and disadvantages of the Supermajority Voting Requirement at this time, the board approved, and recommends that stockholders approve, the amendment and restatement of Articles VIII and XI of the Certificate of Incorporation to remove the Supermajority Voting Requirement contained therein. If approved, future stockholder-approved amendments to the By-Law and Certificate of Incorporation provisions listed above will not be subject to the Supermajority Voting Requirement and will instead require the affirmative vote of a majority of AbbVie’s outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. 78 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING ​ The proposed Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A , which the company would file promptly following the 2024 Annual Meeting if our stockholders approve the amendment. The affirmative vote of the holders of 80 percent of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors on the Record Date is required to approve this proposal pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation. The board has approved certain conforming changes to the company’s By-Laws, contingent on the effectiveness of the proposed amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation. ​ ​ 2024 Proxy Statement | 79 Table of Contents ​ STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS ​ ​ What am I voting on and how should I vote? Three stockholder proposals will be voted upon at the Annual Meeting if properly presented by or on behalf of the proponent. The address and share ownership information of each of the proponents is available upon request. The proposed resolutions and the statements made in support thereof, as well as the board of directors’ statements in opposition to these proposals, are presented on the following pages. The proposal may contain assertions about AbbVie or other statements that we believe are incorrect. The board of directors recommends you vote “AGAINST” the proposals for the reasons set forth following the proposals. ​ Stockholder Proposal on Simple Majority Vote John Chevedden, on behalf of Kenneth Steiner, has notified AbbVie that he intends to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting and that Mr. Steiner owns the requisite number of AbbVie shares. ​ Proposal 6 – Simple Majority Vote ​ Shareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws (that is explicit or implicit due to default to state law) that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be replaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority in compliance with applicable laws. If necessary this means the closest standard to a majority of the votes cast for and against such proposals consistent with applicable laws. This includes making the necessary changes in plain English. Shareholders are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance. Supermajority voting requirements have been found to be one of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to "'What Matters in Corporate Governance” by Lucien Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School. Supermajority requirements like those at Marathon Petroleum are used to block corporate governance improvements supported by most shareowners but opposed by a status quo management. This proposal topic won from 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs, FirstEnergy, McGraw-Hill and Macy's. These votes would have been higher than 74% to 88% if more shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice. This proposal topic also received overwhelming 98%-support each at the 2023 annual meetings of American Airlines (AAL) and The Carlyle Group (CG). This simple majority vote proposal will facilitate the adoption of other improvements in the corporate governance of ABBV such as annual election of each director which will in turn improve the performance of ABBV directors. This simple majority vote proposal will help improve ABBV shareholder rights. ABBV recently scored a dismal 9 in shareholder rights with 10 being the worse possible score. If improved shareholder rights increase the market capitalization of ABBV by one-forth of 1% it would result in a $600 million increase in the market capitalization of ABBV. Thus if ABBV spends a 6-figure sum to encourage more shareholders to vote in order to obtain the required 80%-approval of all shares outstanding, it would result in an astounding 6,000% return ($600 million) on the investment of the 6-figure sum. Please vote yes: Simple Majority Vote – Proposal 6 80 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS ​ Board of Directors Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal on Simple Majority Vote The board of directors recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal.  Given the management proposal on the same topic to eliminate supermajority voting included this year and in prior years, this stockholder proposal is redundant, unnecessary, and confusing. Changing the By-Laws to simple majority vote as the stockholder proposes (and as management similarly proposes in its own proposal) requires 80% of outstanding shares to vote in favor. Supporting this stockholder proposal adds nothing to the effort to eliminate supermajority voting; rather, it is the management proposal that ultimately must pass in order to eliminate supermajority voting (and ultimately, declassify the board).  In other words, even if a stockholder votes in favor of this stockholder proposal, unless the management proposal passes, it has no effect. The board of directors recommends that stockholders vote in favor of its management proposal instead of this stockholder proposal. The board has long demonstrated its commitment to eliminating the supermajority voting provisions in our charter and By-Laws, as evidenced by this year’s management proposal, which was also submitted to a shareholder vote by management in 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018.  Moreover, the board submitted a management proposal on the related issue of declassifying the board in 2018, 2017, and 2016. These management proposals require 80% of outstanding shares to vote in favor in order to pass.  They have not passed in prior years in large part due to a lower than desired vote turnout, primarily among retail holdings.  The stockholder proposal asks AbbVie to spend a “6-figure sum” to ensure the proposal passes.  Over the past several years, AbbVie has had numerous discussions with proxy solicitors about the costs of a get-out-the-vote campaign and the likelihood of success of such a campaign for AbbVie’s stockholder base.  The most recent cost estimate for such a solicitation we received was over $10 million, due to the large retail holdings of AbbVie shares.  The likelihood of campaign success was uncertain and could not be assured even with the large spend. AbbVie conducts a robust investor engagement program each year to greater than 40% of our outstanding shares, and we have never had a stockholder suggest we should spend these types of resources on a get-out-the-vote campaign, other than the proponent. To the contrary, the consistent feedback from our stockholders is that such a cost would not be a good use of company resources, particularly with an uncertain likelihood of success. In sum, the board has already shown a commitment, taken all of the steps necessary to eliminate supermajority voting, and has done so for many years.  Stockholders may vote for the management proposal to eliminate supermajority voting instead of this stockholder proposal.  The board remains committed to eliminating supermajority voting and ultimately declassifying the board, but a non-binding, advisory stockholder proposal does nothing to advance these goals. The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal. ​ ​ Stockholder Proposal on Lobbying Zevin Asset Management on behalf of Alyson Pyette, and co-filers Dana Investment Advisors and Miller/Howard Investments, Inc. on behalf of Owen Harvey, have notified AbbVie that they intend to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting and that they own the requisite number of AbbVie shares. Resolved, the stockholders of AbbVie request the preparation of a report, updated annually, disclosing: 1. Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications. 2024 Proxy Statement | 81 Table of Contents ​ ​ STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS ​ ​ 2. Payments by AbbVie used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient. 3. AbbVie’s membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation. 4. Description of management’s decision-making process and the Board’s oversight for making payments described in point 2 above. For purposes of this proposal, a “grassroots lobbying communication” is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. “Indirect lobbying” is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which AbbVie is a member. Both “direct and indirect lobbying” and “grassroots lobbying communications” include efforts at the local, state and federal levels. The report shall be presented to the Public Policy and Sustainability Committee and posted on AbbVie’s website. Supporting Statement Full disclosure of AbbVie’s lobbying activities and expenditures is needed to assess whether AbbVie’s lobbying is consistent with its expressed goals and stockholder interests. AbbVie spent $63,850,000 between 2013 – 2022 on federal lobbying. AbbVie lobbies at the state level, spending over $2.5 million on lobbying in California from 2013 – 2022. AbbVie also lobbies abroad, spending between €1,000,000 – 1,249,999 on lobbying in Europe for 2022. Companies can give unlimited amounts to third party groups that spend millions on lobbying and undisclosed grassroots activity. 1 AbbVie reportedly gave nonprofits over $300 million in 2018. 2 Unlike many of its peers, AbbVie fails to disclose its payments to trade associations and social welfare groups (SWGs), or the amounts used for lobbying, to stockholders. AbbVie discloses membership in the Chamber of Commerce, which has spent over $1.8 billion on lobbying since 1998. AbbVie’s disclosure omits several trade associations that lobby including the Healthcare Distribution Alliance and Healthcare Institute of New Jersey and all SWGs, including the Alliance for Patient Access. 3 AbbVie’s lack of disclosure presents reputational risk when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. AbbVie states it supports more affordable medicines yet has drawn scrutiny for lobbying “to kill lower drug prices during pandemic” 4 and funding “ads attacking prescription drug bill — after hiking prices up to 470%.” 5 AbbVie believes in addressing climate change, yet the Chamber reportedly has been a “central actor” in dissuading climate legislation over a two-decade period. 6 And while AbbVie does not belong to the controversial American Legislative Exchange Council, 7 it is represented by the Chamber, which sits on its Private Enterprise Advisory Council. 8 AbbVie should expand its disclosure to benefit investors seeking information about the company. 1 https://theintercept.com/2019/08/06/business-group-spending-on-lobbying-in-washington-is-at-least-double-whats-publicly-reported/ . 2 https://about.bgov.com/news/abbvie-bristol-myers-among-patient-advocacy-groups-big-backers/ . 3 https://prospect.org/power/astroturf-campaign-attacks-discount-drug-program-for-poor/ . 4 https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/07/13/big-pharma-has-spent-147-million-kill-lower-drug-prices-during-pandemic . 5 https://www.salon.com/2021/05/26/pharma-giant-abbvie-funds-ads-attacking-prescription-drug-bill--after-hiking-prices-up-to-470/ . 6 https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/02/climate-group-pushes-big-tech-exit-nations-largest-business-lobby/ . 7 https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2023/03/22/esg-investing-fossil-fuels . 8 https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/09/06/coming-soon-in-ohio-alec-releases-new-raft-of-model-legislation/ . ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 82 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS ​ Board of Directors Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal on Lobbying ​ The board of directors recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal. AbbVie advocates on topics that advance patient access to innovative new medicines and reward meaningful innovation.  This engagement is governed by robust processes and oversight mechanisms. ​ As discussed in more detail on our website, AbbVie advocates on a range of issues core to our business, including advancing patient access to innovative new medicines.  This advocacy is governed by robust processes and oversight mechanisms, including: ● The public policy and sustainability committee exercises oversight of AbbVie’s political expenditures and lobbying activities, which are further governed by the committee’s policy on political contributions. The public policy and sustainability committee and AbbVie’s senior management review these activities and expenditures on a regular basis. ● The Senior Vice President, Government Affairs reviews and approves all corporate political contributions to ensure these contributions are consistent with the company’s guidelines and in accordance with applicable laws as required by the committee’s policy on political contributions. ● An internal Political Action Committee (PAC) Board of Directors comprised of at least twelve senior leaders representing a broad range of functions within AbbVie guides the AbbVie PAC. ● A rigorous internal vetting process is conducted to review each political contribution. ● The Senior Vice President, Government Affairs exercises oversight of all external vendors that lobby on AbbVie’s behalf. ● AbbVie’s Code of Business Conduct sets forth AbbVie’s robust expectations for ethical behavior by all employees in all aspects of our business, including political advocacy. ​ AbbVie has long been recognized as a leader for robust disclosures related to political and lobbying activities, and we made significant additions to these disclosures on our public website in 2022, 2023, and 2024. ​ Since our launch as a new public company in 2013, AbbVie has provided robust transparency related to our political and lobbying activities.  As a result of our extensive disclosures, AbbVie has been consistently recognized as a leader in providing the highest level of political transparency and accountability. In 2023, AbbVie was again recognized as a “trendsetter” in this area by the CPA-Zicklin Index, the highest ranking a company can receive. This index, which is produced by the non-profit Center for Political Accountability in conjunction with the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, benchmarks the political disclosure and accountability policies and practices of leading U.S. public companies. AbbVie was also consistently ranked in the top tier of companies from 2014 through 2023. ​ Following our robust investor dialogue throughout 2021, we further strengthened our disclosures in 2022, which can be found at: https://www.abbvie.com/who-we-are/policies-disclosures.html.  The changes include: ● Additional disclosures on the range of issues that AbbVie advocates on ● Significantly more detail on AbbVie’s PAC, including its leadership structure ● A description of the rigorous process used to vet all AbbVie corporate and AbbVie PAC contributions ● Lowering the threshold for disclosure of our trade association memberships from $50,000 in annual dues to $25,000 in annual dues ● A description of how AbbVie may choose to convey concerns with any opposing positions taken by trade associations to which we belong ● Other details, such as the annual ethics and legal training that all AbbVie federal and state government affairs representatives receive ​ 2024 Proxy Statement | 83 Table of Contents ​ ​ STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS ​ ​ Similarly, after seeking feedback from our investors in 2023, we made additional updates on our website, including: ● Additional disclosure on our political activities in Europe, including a link to our EU lobbying reports ● Adding the percentage of trade association dues spent on federal lobbying, in our existing trade association memberships disclosure ● Discussing the congruency between AbbVie’s stated political activity priorities (e.g., intellectual property protections, access to health care, and tax) and the advocacy of the largest trade association to which AbbVie belongs (i.e., the U.S. Chamber of Commerce). ​ Finally, in early 2024, we further updated our website to clearly disclose our total federal lobbying spend for the most recent prior year and to provide more detailed tiering for our existing trade association disclosures.  These updates from 2022 to 2024 reflect AbbVie’s established history of responsiveness to stockholder feedback.  Given this demonstrated commitment to transparency, the report requested in the proposal is unnecessary and would not add value. ​ The chart below summarizes the disclosures sought by the proposal and provides an explanation of how AbbVie already provides this disclosure or how additional disclosures would not be feasible or valuable. ​ ​ ​ Proposal Ask AbbVie Position Company policy and procedures governing both direct and indirect lobbying, as well as grassroots lobbying communications ● AbbVie’s website includes an extensive discussion of the policy and procedures we employ for both lobbying and political contributions. ● As disclosed on our website, AbbVie does not currently make direct expenditures toward U.S. federal or state grassroots lobbying communications to the general public. If such a contribution were made, it would be enumerated in AbbVie’s reports on other corporate political contributions. Payments by AbbVie used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications ● AbbVie updated its website in 2024 to directly state the total amount of federal lobbying spend for the most recently completed year.  This is in addition to providing links to prior years’ federal lobbying reports.  It is not feasible to provide a similar total disclosure for state lobbying spend, as each state defines lobbying spend differently, so the standard is not uniform across all states. ● As disclosed on our website, AbbVie does not currently make direct expenditures toward U.S. federal or state grassroots lobbying communications to the general public. If such a contribution were made, it would be enumerated in AbbVie’s reports on other corporate political contributions. ● Attempting to quantify total indirect lobbying would be difficult to estimate and potentially misleading to stockholders as AbbVie is not directing the lobbying activities of trade, civic or patient groups. AbbVie’s membership in and payments to tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation ● As disclosed on our website, AbbVie does not currently contribute funds intended for use in elections to tax-exempt organizations under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. If such a contribution were made, it would be enumerated in AbbVie’s reports on other corporate political contributions. ● It is difficult for us to determine which third parties may endorse model legislation and whether such activities fall within the proposal’s request. Description of management’s decision-making process and the board’s oversight for making lobbying payments ● AbbVie’s website includes an extensive discussion of company advocacy priorities, as well as the practical steps for how the company allocates lobbying and political contributions spend.  The website also discusses oversight by AbbVie’s board, and more specifically, the public policy and sustainability committee, of the company’s lobbying priorities. ​ 84 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS ​ In 2022, AbbVie decided not to renew several large trade associations, which reduces the risk of any potential incongruency. ​ AbbVie decided not to renew its memberships in four large trade associations (PhRMA, BIO, IFPMA, and the Business Roundtable) in 2022.  This decision was made as part of our rigorous annual assessment of our trade association memberships.  The proposal cites the purported misalignment between AbbVie and certain trade associations’ positions. Our robust process and ultimate decision not to renew our memberships in four large trade associations reduces the risk of any potential incongruency.  Therefore, producing an additional report would be unnecessary and unhelpful. ​ The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal. ​ Stockholder Proposal on Patent Process Friends Fiduciary Corporation and co-filers Mercy Investment Services, Inc., Bon Secours Mercy Health, Inc., The Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth, The Sisters of the Order of St. Dominic (Grand Rapids), The Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Trinity Health, CommonSpirit Health, NEI Investments, Northwest Women Religious Investment Trust (Sisters of Saint Joseph of Peace), Providence St. Joseph Health, and The Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia, and Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, have notified AbbVie that they intend to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting and that they own the requisite number of AbbVie shares. ​ RESOLVED, that shareholders of AbbVie Inc. ("AbbVie") ask the Board of Directors to establish and report on a process by which the impact of extended patent exclusivities on product access would be considered in deciding whether to apply for secondary and tertiary patents. Secondary and tertiary patents are patents applied for after the main active ingredient/molecule patent(s) and which relate to the product. The report on the process should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting confidential and proprietary information, and published on AbbVie's website. Supporting Statement ​ Intellectual property protections on branded drugs play an important role in maintaining high prices and impeding access. When patent protection on a drug ends, generic manufacturers can enter the market, reducing prices. But branded drug manufacturers may delay generic competition by extending their exclusivity periods. ​ Access to medicines, especially costly specialty drugs, is the subject of consistent and widespread public debate in the U.S. A 2021 Rand Corporation analysis concluded that U.S. prices for branded drugs were nearly 3.5 times higher than prices in 32 OECD member countries. 1 The Kaiser Family Foundation has "consistently found prescription drug costs to be an important health policy area of public interest and public concern.” 2 ​ This high level of concern has driven policy responses. The Inflation Reduction Act empowers the federal government to negotiate some drug prices, and in fact some have argued it enacts significant patent reform, specifically around the issue this proposal seeks to understand. This comes from one important provision stating that the only drugs that can be considered for price negotiations are those with no generic competition, thus discouraging extended patent exclusivities. ​ Additionally, five Senate bipartisan bills aim to speed access to generics: 1. Ensuring Timely Access to Generics Act of 2023 (S. 1067) 2. Expanding Access to Low-Cost Generics Act of 2023 (S. 1114) 3. Increasing Transparency in Generic Drug Applications Act of 2023 (S. 775) 4. Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act of 2023 (S. 142) 5. Stop STALLING Act of 2023 (S. 148) ​ AbbVie also faces potential significant legal risk as one of several companies the Federal Trade Commission has issued letters to claiming the Company "improperly listed patents in the Food and Drug Administration's 'Orange Book' in order to block generic rivals." 3 2024 Proxy Statement | 85 Table of Contents ​ ​ STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS ​ ​ ​ AbbVie has raised the price of Humira, its top-selling drug, 27 times since its launch. One hundred and thirty patents, most of them secondary patents, have been granted on Humira, extending its exclusivity period by 19 years. 4 AbbVie touted to investors in a 2015 presentation that challenging any of Humira's patents in litigation would take four to five years. 5 ​ In our view, a more thoughtful process that considers the impact of extended exclusivity periods on patient access could bolster AbbVie's reputation and help avoid regulatory blowback resulting from high drug prices and perceptions regarding abusive patenting practices. _____________________________ 1 https://www.rand.org/news/press/2021/01/28.html 2 https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding-public-opinion-on-prescription-drugs-and-their-prices/ 3 https://pharmaphorum.com/news/ftc-chaIlenges-dozens-improper-us-drug-patents 4 https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/DRUG%20PRICING%20REPORT%20WIT H%20APPENDIX%20v3.pdf, at ix, 17. 5 https://investors.abbvie.com/static-files/af79eef2-5901-4b62-9354-982d2d95404e, slide 16 ​ ​ Board of Directors Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal on Patent Process The board of directors recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal. AbbVie is committed to patient access and acts responsibly in all aspects of its business, including intellectual property. Acting with Integrity is one of the five AbbVie Principles, which are foundational to who we are as a company. This includes acting in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as engaging in conduct consistent with our commitment to honesty, fairness, and integrity, in every aspect of our business. AbbVie’s ethical decision-making extends to protecting our intellectual property, which covers meaningful innovation and investment in our life-changing medicines. Each year, AbbVie’s medicines treat tens of millions of people across over 75 conditions, and since our inception as an independent company in 2013, we have invested over $60 billion in research and development. AbbVie has numerous mechanisms to ensure access to our innovative medicines, including those that remain exclusive. For example, patients in the United States without insurance or those with limited coverage can receive AbbVie medicines at no cost to them through myAbbVie Assist. The program serves as an important safety net and helps 99% of uninsured patients who seek our assistance. In 2023, the income eligibility requirement for myAbbVie Assist was 600% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), or an income of less than $180,000 for a household of four people. In 2023, myAbbVie Assist supported over 218,000 patients in the United States.  As another example, within the United States, we provide co-pay assistance, regardless of income, to all patients with commercial insurance; with this assistance, most eligible patients pay $5-10 per month for their AbbVie medicines. More than 90% of commercial patients utilize our co-pay assistance program. We also make donations to independent charitable foundations that provide co-pay assistance to patients in need, regardless of what type of therapy they are on. Outside of the United States, AbbVie’s programs to enhance patient access include our participation in licensing agreements with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) to increase access to critical medicines for patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).  For example, our MPP agreements span nearly 100 countries for Mavyret, an AbbVie medicine used to treat HCV.  To promote access to medicines for those in need with no means of accessing them due to limitations and availability, we host global medicine donation programs.  We have seven ongoing medicine donation partnerships with non-governmental organizations providing care in LMICs.  To assist with out-of-pocket costs of medicines, AbbVie offers several programs that help to reduce the cost burden for patients to pay for our medicines.  Each program is tailored to meet the unique needs of patients and the patient 86 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ​ STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS ​ communities within the specific geography, disease area, and payer context.  Other steps that AbbVie takes to further patient access globally can be found in our annual ESG Action Report. AbbVie’s existing disclosures address our approach to intellectual property and patient access. As discussed in more detail on our website (https://www.abbvie.com/who-we-are/policies-disclosures.html) in a document titled “Intellectual Property and Patient Access” that was updated in early 2024, AbbVie has further expanded upon the factors it considers when pursuing patents. Patents are critical to protecting the significant investments that allow AbbVie to solve serious health issues. Patents provide a limited period of exclusivity for our products – allowing AbbVie to recoup its investment not only from the initial discovery of the medicine itself, but also our ongoing investment in that medicine.  AbbVie’s R&D does not stop after the initial discovery of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or after a patent application is filed on that active pharmaceutical ingredient.  AbbVie researchers continue to confront complex problems arising from their work in the laboratory to developments in the clinic – leading to groundbreaking innovations and advancements in patient care.  These discoveries can include new indications and patient populations, pharmaceutical formulations and methods for drug delivery, and enhanced processes for manufacturing quality pharmaceutical products.  AbbVie invests years to refine and validate these scientific discoveries to obtain regulatory approval, before delivering any pharmaceutical product to patients.  Patents filed subsequent to the main active ingredient patent ensure that we are able to invest further resources into studying the medicine in new patient populations and diseases over time, optimizing the process used to manufacture the medicine, and improving the formulation of the medicine over time to provide meaningful patient benefits. Patents also allow us to re-invest in developing new medicines, further improving patients’ standards of care over time. As discussed in our website disclosure, when AbbVie assesses whether to apply for a patent to cover a certain innovation, we consider many factors, such as: ● Science is at the heart of everything we do at AbbVie, including our decisions related to patents. AbbVie pursues patents that reflect meaningful innovation and scientific advancements, including those that have the potential to improve the treatment of patients.  Such innovation may improve safety and efficacy of patient care, while other innovations may enhance the quality and efficiency of AbbVie’s manufacturing processes. ● AbbVie carefully considers the state of the art, how our discovery materially advances the technology, and patent laws of the relevant jurisdiction. ● We also consider the value of a public disclosure in advancing science. ● Finally, we take into account the size of the underlying investment and the potential impact on patient access. AbbVie’s enhanced website disclosure provides a specific product example to showcase the value that intellectual property provides in terms of driving continued innovation and investment in improving patient care.  We also expanded this disclosure to further discuss some of the ways in which AbbVie ensures patient access to its medicines. In the absence of meaningful patent protection, our ability to invest in R&D would be constrained and could limit the creation of promising new medicines for patients.  AbbVie also has an established history of granting patent licenses under appropriate circumstances, in order to facilitate broader global access to our medicines. We believe this approach can protect AbbVie’s investments and further patient access to innovative new medicines. AbbVie obtains these intellectual property rights only by lawful and ethical means.  Patent applications undergo rigorous reviews at patent offices around the world and are granted only after meeting all criteria for patentability.  AbbVie carefully monitors developments in patent law, including proposed legislation and rulemaking at federal agencies.  AbbVie incorporates the analysis of any such new law or regulation when deciding how to protect and enforce our intellectual property.  Our website also discloses the oversight of AbbVie’s intellectual property processes by our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; Senior Vice President, Chief Patent and Innovation Counsel; and board of directors. 2024 Proxy Statement | 87 Table of Contents ​ ​ STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS ​ ​ Any disclosures beyond AbbVie’s existing disclosures are either not feasible or would be unnecessarily burdensome.  It is not feasible to predict, at the time of filing a patent application, what impact that filing will have on a specific outcome on patient access.  AbbVie files patent applications when innovations are developed – often many years before AbbVie knows whether a new active ingredient, pharmaceutical formulation, or indication that is the subject of the patent application will receive FDA approval.  Thus, the relevance of the filing of any patent application is not known until after the medicine is fully developed and the nature of any competing products is known.  Although the proposal states the requested report should exclude confidential information, publishing more detail on AbbVie’s patenting processes (beyond our existing disclosure discussed above) could threaten AbbVie’s competitive interests, given that the patent application filing process is confidential. In sum, AbbVie already has existing robust disclosures and an additional report would not reveal anything of additional value to investors worthy of the burden it would pose. The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal. ​ ​ 88 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Corporate Governance Materials AbbVie’s corporate governance guidelines with the outline of directorship qualifications; director independence guidelines; code of business conduct; and audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy and sustainability committee charters are all available in the governance section of AbbVie’s investor relations website at www.abbvieinvestor.com .

Related person transactions requiring review by the nominations and governance committee pursuant to this policy are identified in: ● questionnaires annually distributed to AbbVie’s directors and executive officers; ● certifications submitted annually by AbbVie executive officers related to their compliance with AbbVie’s Code of Business Conduct; or ● communications made directly by the related person to the chief financial officer or general counsel. In determining whether to approve or disapprove a related person transaction, the nominations and governance committee will consider the following items, among others: ● the related person’s relationship to AbbVie and interest in the transaction; ● the material facts of the transaction, including the aggregate value of such transaction or, in the case of indebtedness, the amount of principal involved; ● the benefits to AbbVie of the transaction; ● if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services; ● an assessment of whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees generally; ● whether a transaction has the potential to impair director independence; and ● whether the transaction constitutes a conflict of interest. This process is included in the nominations and governance committee’s written charter, which is available on the governance section of AbbVie’s investor relations website at www.abbvieinvestor.com . Nicholas Donoghoe, M.D., Executive Vice President, Chief Business and Strategy Officer, was appointed as an executive officer of AbbVie during 2023.  Dr. Donoghoe’s wife, Jessica Heckmann Donoghoe, is a minority equity owner in LaserAway, a chain of aesthetics clinics.  Dr. Donoghoe’s brothers-in-law Brock Heckmann, Scott Heckmann, and Todd Heckmann are also equity owners, as well as executives, at LaserAway.  LaserAway purchased $16.1 million worth of AbbVie products during 2023, including Botox Cosmetic, Juvederm, and Coolsculpting.  LaserAway also receives product samples for educational and other training purposes.  Dr. Donoghoe does not have any visibility to or control over the terms of the LaserAway transactions, and the LaserAway terms are generally consistent with those of similarly situated customers.  LaserAway first became a customer of the Allergan group of companies before AbbVie acquired Allergan in 2020.  Our nominations and governance committee, pursuant to its committee charter, has reviewed and approved the foregoing arrangement with LaserAway. 2024 Proxy Statement | 89 Table of Contents ​ ​ ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ​ ​ Alexander Freyman, who is the son of Thomas Freyman, a director of the company, is an employee at AbbVie.  Alexander earned $122,327.73 in total compensation in 2023.  Thomas Freyman has no role in setting Alexander’s compensation, and Alexander’s compensation is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to similarly situated employees.  Our nominations and governance committee, pursuant to its committee charter, has reviewed and approved Alexander’s compensation. Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires AbbVie’s directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of AbbVie’s equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership of such equity securities of AbbVie. With the exception of one amended report filed on May 9, 2023 on behalf of a director, which corrected an earlier filing on February 21, 2023 that had omitted the sale of 6,222 additional shares due to administrative error, to AbbVie’s knowledge, no executive officer or director of AbbVie failed to file reports required by Section 16(a) on a timely basis. Exclusive Forum AbbVie is incorporated in the state of Delaware and Delaware law governs the relationship among its directors, officers, and stockholders (also known as the internal affairs doctrine). To provide for the orderly, efficient and cost-effective resolution of Delaware- law issues affecting AbbVie, the company’s Certificate of Incorporation provides that unless the board of directors otherwise determines, Delaware courts are the exclusive forum for cases involving the internal affairs doctrine, derivative actions brought on behalf of the company, claims for breach of fiduciary duty, and other matters concerning Delaware statutory and common law. The provision does not apply to any other cases brought against AbbVie. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the exclusive forum provision with respect to claims under the federal securities laws. The preceding paragraph is not an exhaustive description. Other Matters The board of directors knows of no other business to be transacted at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, but if any other matters do come before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote or act with respect to them in accordance with their best judgment.

In addition to satisfying the requirements under the By-Laws described in the immediately preceding paragraph, to comply with the universal proxy rules under the Exchange Act, any stockholder who intends to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the Board’s nominees must provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than March 4, 2025. However, if the date of the 2025 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or after the anniversary of the date of the 2024 Annual Meeting, then such notice must be delivered by the later of (x) the 10th day following the day we first publicly announce the date of the 2025 Annual Meeting and (y) the date which is 60 days prior to the date of the 2025 Annual Meeting. Householding of Proxy Materials The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as brokers or banks) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more security holders sharing the same address by delivering a single Notice or proxy statement addressed to those security holders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for security holders and cost savings for companies. Several brokers and banks with accountholders who are AbbVie stockholders will be “householding” our proxy materials. As indicated in the notice provided by these brokers to AbbVie stockholders, a single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected stockholder. Once you have received notice from your broker that it will be “householding” communications to your address, “householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and you prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your broker, or contact Broadridge Financial Solutions at 1-866-540-7095, or write to us at Investor Relations, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, Illinois 60064. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request “householding” of their communications should contact their broker or bank. Annual Report on Form 10-K AbbVie filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 with the SEC on February 20, 2024. The Annual Report on Form 10-K, including all exhibits, is also available free of charge on AbbVie’s investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ). Paper copies of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and schedules, may be obtained free of charge from AbbVie. Paper copies of exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K are available, but a reasonable fee per page will be charged to the requesting stockholder. Stockholders may make requests in writing to us at Investor Relations, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, Illinois 60064. 2024 Proxy Statement | 91 Table of Contents ​ ​ ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ​ ​ Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Some statements in this proxy statement are, or may be considered, forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "project" and similar expressions and uses of future or conditional verbs, generally identify forward-looking statements. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, challenges to intellectual property, competition from other products, difficulties inherent in the research and development process, adverse litigation or government action, and changes to laws and regulations applicable to our industry. Additional information about the economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect AbbVie's operations is set forth in Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of AbbVie's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as updated by its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in other documents that AbbVie subsequently files with the Securities and Exchange Commission that update, supplement or supersede such information. AbbVie undertakes no obligation, and specifically declines, to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. General It is important that proxies be returned promptly. Stockholders are urged to vote, regardless of the number of shares of AbbVie common stock owned. Stockholders may vote by telephone, by Internet, or by mail if a printed version of the proxy card was received or requested. Stockholders who vote by telephone or the Internet do not need to return a proxy card. The Annual Meeting will be held on Friday, May 3, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. CT. This year’s Annual Meeting will be a virtual meeting of stockholders. It is important to us that our stockholders be able to engage with the company and its executives during the annual meeting. AbbVie held virtual stockholder meetings in recent years and generally received positive feedback from investors.  We found that more stockholders were able to attend and our executive leadership team was able to answer more stockholder questions than in prior years, when the company held in-person meetings. A virtual meeting allows more stockholders to attend the meeting equally and without cost, from anywhere around the globe. At the 2024 virtual meeting, stockholders will be able to attend the Annual Meeting, vote, and submit questions via live webcast by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ ABBV2024. Consistent with prior practice at our in-person meetings, we will address as many stockholder-submitted question topics as time permits.  If we do not have time to address a specific question, a member of our governance team will follow-up with the stockholder(s) after the meeting.  The virtual meeting website can be accessed on a computer, tablet, or phone with internet connection. For stockholders without access to the internet, you may listen to the Annual Meeting by telephone at 1-877-328-2502 (USA) or 1-412-317-5419 (International). AbbVie will make any required list of stockholders available during the meeting. Closed captioning will be available on the meeting platform. On the day of the Annual Meeting, stockholders may begin to log in to the online virtual annual meeting platform beginning at 8:45 a.m. Central Time, and the meeting will begin promptly at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. Please allow ample time for online login. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the virtual meeting or during the meeting time, please call 1-844-986-0822 (USA) or 1-303-562-9302 (International) for technical support. To be admitted to the Annual Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ABBV2024, you must enter the control number found on your proxy card, voting instruction form or notice you received. You may vote during the Annual Meeting by following the instructions available on the meeting website during the meeting. ​ ​ By order of the board of directors. PERRY C. SIATIS SECRETARY ​ ​ ​ ​ 92 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING Who Can Vote Stockholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2024 will be entitled to notice of and to vote during the Annual Meeting. As of March 4, 2024, AbbVie had 1,770,646,983 outstanding shares of common stock, which are AbbVie’s only outstanding voting securities. Each stockholder has one vote per share. Stockholders do not have the right to vote cumulatively in electing directors. Notice and Access In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) e-proxy rules, AbbVie mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “Notice”) to stockholders on or around March 18, 2024. The Notice describes the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting and how stockholders can access the proxy materials online. It also provides instructions on how stockholders can vote their shares. If you received the Notice, you will not receive a printed version of the proxy materials unless you request one. If you would like to receive a printed version of the proxy materials, free of charge, please follow the instructions on the Notice. Voting by Proxy AbbVie’s stockholders may vote their shares by telephone, the Internet, or during the Annual Meeting. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. The instructions for voting can be found on the Notice, on the website listed in the Notice, and, if you received one, on your proxy card. If you requested a printed version of the proxy card, you may also vote by mail. Revoking a Proxy You may revoke your proxy by voting during the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the meeting: ● by delivering a written notice to the secretary of AbbVie, ● by delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or ● by voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy. Discretionary Voting Authority Unless otherwise specified in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares of AbbVie common stock covered by proxies they receive to elect the five nominees named in Item 1 on the proxy card. If a nominee becomes unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the board of directors or for fewer than five nominees if, in the judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. Where a stockholder has specified a choice for or against the proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting or if the stockholder has chosen to abstain, the shares of AbbVie common stock represented by the proxy will be voted (or not voted) as specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors, FOR the approval of executive compensation, for ONE YEAR for the frequency of future approvals of executive compensation, FOR the management proposal to eliminate supermajority voting, and AGAINST each of the stockholder proposals. The board of directors is not aware of any other issue that may properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders. 2024 Proxy Statement | 93 Table of Contents ​ ​ INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING ​ ​ Quorum The presence of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors constitutes a quorum, which is required to hold and conduct business at the Annual Meeting. Shares are counted as present at the Annual Meeting if: ● You are represented in person at the Annual Meeting; or ● Your shares are represented by a properly authorized and submitted proxy (submitted by mail, by telephone, or over the internet) Abstentions and broker non-votes will count towards shares present at the Annual Meeting for the purpose of determining a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned, from time to time, by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. Votes Required for Each Item 1. Election of Directors : In uncontested elections such as this one, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast is required to elect each director. This means that the number of votes cast “FOR” a director’s election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director’s election. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as a vote cast either “FOR” or “AGAINST” with respect to the director or directors indicated and therefore will have no effect on this proposal. Brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on this proposal. 2. Ratification of Independent Auditor : The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter is required for the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as AbbVie’s independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions will be counted as votes “AGAINST” this proposal. A broker or other nominee may generally vote on routine matters such as this one, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection with this proposal. 3. Say on Pay: Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation : The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter is required for the approval of the advisory vote to approve the compensation of AbbVie’s named executive officers. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon AbbVie’s Board of Directors. Abstentions will be counted as votes “AGAINST” this proposal and broker non-votes will have no effect on this proposal. Brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on this proposal. 4. Say When on Pay: Advisory Vote on the Frequency of the Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation : The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter is required for the approval of the advisory vote to approve the frequency of the advisory vote to approve the compensation of AbbVie’s named executive officers. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon AbbVie’s Board of Directors. Abstentions will be counted as votes “AGAINST” this proposal and broker non-votes will have no effect on this proposal. Brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on this proposal. ​ If no frequency receives the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter, then we will consider the option that receives the highest number of votes to be the frequency recommended by stockholders. 5. Management Proposal to Eliminate Supermajority Voting : The affirmative vote of shares representing not less than eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares of capital stock of AbbVie entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is required for the approval of the management proposal to eliminate supermajority voting pursuant to Article XI of AbbVie’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as votes “AGAINST” this proposal. Brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on this proposal. 6–8. Stockholder Proposals : The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter is required for the approval of the stockholder proposals presented at the meeting. 94 | 2024 Proxy Statement Table of Contents INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING Abstentions will be counted as votes “AGAINST” these proposals and broker non-votes will have no effect on these proposals. Brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on these proposals. Inspectors of Election The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify stockholders are independent and are not AbbVie employees. Cost of Soliciting Proxies AbbVie will bear the cost of making solicitations from its stockholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail, telephone, Internet, or in person by directors, officers, or employees of AbbVie and its subsidiaries. AbbVie has retained Alliance Advisors LLC to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $20,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. AbbVie Savings Plan Participants in the AbbVie Savings Plan will receive voting instructions for their shares of AbbVie common stock held in the AbbVie Savings Plan Trust. The Trust is administered by both a trustee and an investment committee. The trustee is Empower Trust Company, LLC. The members of the investment committee are Demetris Crum, Stefan Geldmeyer, and Andrew Shafer, employees of AbbVie. The voting power with respect to the shares is held by and shared between the investment committee and the participants. The investment committee must solicit voting instructions from the participants and follow the voting instructions it receives. The investment committee may use its own discretion with respect to those shares of AbbVie common stock for which no voting instructions are received. ​ ​ 2024 Proxy Statement | 95 Table of Contents Appendix A Proposed Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of AbbVie Inc.
