The health and safety of PPG employees, partners and customers continues to reflect the company’s most important core value. Through much of 2020, and continuing today, the company has enacted protocols to protect our people and manage our business in this new environment: ​ Enhanced workplace safety ​ ● Implemented proven, safe operating processes that have been used around the world to keep PPG people safe, including: o Implemented best practice hygiene techniques o Provided personal protective equipment o Enabled social distancing o Required on-site employees and visitors to wear face coverings o Sanitized work areas o Prohibited large gatherings and limited in-person visits from third parties o Enacted work-from-home protocols where possible ● Made site-by-site and person-by-person decisions with the safety of our people as our most important core value ● Monitored the health of our global workforce and took measures to protect PPG employees and customers in accordance with global and regional government requirements ● Initiated a reporting mechanism to track employees affected by COVID-19 ● Benchmarked how other industry leaders were handling the crisis and incorporated best practices ​ Communicated frequent updates to employees ​ ● Distributed more than 20 video messages from the CEO to employees with updates on the pandemic and its impact on PPG’s business, employees and customers ● Cascaded ongoing communications messages from business leaders across the Company ● Shared success stories and provided tools and resources for managers ● Provided a wide array of communications via the company Intranet, employee resource website, e-mail and video messages, encouraging safe operating practices and hygiene practices both within and outside of the workplace ​ Provided workplace flexibility ​ ● Implemented alternative work arrangements, such as working remotely and staggering shifts and breaks for essential employees who remained on site at essential operations, which included manufacturing facilities and laboratories ● Adjusted operations to comply with government guidelines ​ Increased employee engagement and recognition ​ ● Accelerated the introduction of digital tools to connect employees ● Extended leadership and individual contributor training programs into virtual and interactive formats and deployed them globally ● Measured progress by continuing a regular cadence of employee engagement surveys and deploying a communications effectiveness survey ● Encouraged employee recognition through the One PPG Recognition and Rewards Program ● Paid about $6 million in special bonuses to recognize our front-line and field workers for their outstanding commitment throughout 2020 ​ ​ ​ ​ 6 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ ​ Supported our customers In addition, our products play an essential role in a wide range of important industries during this time. Our paints, coatings and specialty materials help create life-critical products for the health care, defense, food and beverage, hygiene, agriculture, energy, public works, and electronics industries, as well as many others. More directly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on utilizing our existing products and new innovations to support and protect our global customers. For example: 100,000 Gallons of Hand Sanitizer ​ ​ Development of New Antiviral Coatings PPG joined forces with Corning Inc. to seek EPA approval for a paint product that incorporates Corning’s new glass-ceramic technology, which has been proven to kill more than 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. We pivoted a manufacturing line in order to provide 100,000 gallons of hand sanitizer for The Home Depot’s 1,900 stores. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ protect and beautify the world At the center of PPG’s purpose is a commitment to “protect and beautify the world.” As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, the word ‘protect’ has taken on even greater meaning as we remain focused on protecting our people, customers, communities and all of our stakeholders. ​ ​ ​ ​ Reduced base salaries of our executive officers Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee approved a temporary 30% base salary reduction for our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and a temporary 25% base salary reduction for our other executive officers. Our Culture The success of our company is tied to our people. We are committed to ensuring they are safe, healthy, engaged, and valued for the diverse talents they bring to PPG. We offer development and advancement opportunities so they are equipped to make meaningful contributions, be successful, and achieve their full potential. By fostering inclusiveness, welcoming diverse perspectives, and empowering our people, PPG becomes more innovative, productive, and competitive. ​ ​ ● ● ● ● ● ● ​ The PPG Way ​ Developed in partnership with PPG’s Operating Committee in 2018 and launched globally in 2019, The PPG Way aims to enable, empower, and encourage each employee to embrace the core pillars of our company culture. It serves as a cultural roadmap for all employees as we collectively strive to protect and beautify the world. ​ The pillars of The PPG Way: ● We partner with customers to create mutual value ● We are “One PPG” to the world ● We trust our people every day, in every way ● We make it happen ● We run it like we own it ● We do better today than yesterday – everyday Leveraging the momentum of the 2019 roll-out, we continued to drive The PPG Way in 2020 with manager-led sessions aimed at helping teams find meaningful ways to embed The PPG Way into their everyday work. We saw the outcome of our combined efforts in the annual employee engagement survey results, showing not only a continued increase in overall engagement, but marked improvement on all items tied to The PPG Way pillars, giving a clear indication that employees, at all levels, continue to live The PPG Way. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 7 ​ Table of Contents Diversity, Equity and Inclusion One of PPG’s greatest strengths is the diversity of our people. We take a wide-ranging view of diversity, inclusive of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability/ability, religion, nationality, educational background, among other factors. Our employees’ unique perspectives enable us to meet challenges quickly, creatively and effectively, providing a significant competitive advantage in today’s global economy. Inclusive cultures and diverse teams perform better and are more successful. More than being a smart thing to do for our business, diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) is the right thing to do on so many levels. PPG is committed to making it happen – each and every day. To underscore this commitment, PPG chairman and chief executive officer, Michael McGarry, was one of the first 150 signatories of the CEO ACTION FOR DIVERSITY & INCLUSION ® pledge in 2017, which is now the largest CEO-driven business coalition of 1,500+ companies to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. In 2020, PPG strengthened its focus on DE&I across the company. Through these efforts, we’ve looked more closely at ourselves, our workforce and our workplace, and made a series of eight commitments to grow and strengthen DE&I: ● Adding a dedicated DE&I leader, responsible to design, lead and execute our global DE&I vision and strategy ● Leveraging fact-based/data-driven strategies, initiatives and decision- making to better understand demographic and culture opportunities across our workforce ● Continue to listen. PPG leaders and external experts conducted listening sessions with employees across all levels of the organization in 2020, and these will continue ● Accelerate our diverse recruitment, including a pilot program in the U.S. to develop improved processes for building more diverse candidate slates ● Develop, together, an aspirational DE&I vision and strategy. We will work to promote inclusion, representation, equity and justice for all employees ● Review processes, programs and practices to drive alignment with our DE&I vision and strategy ● Extend our “unconscious-bias" training efforts. We will extend the reach of the current unconscious-bias training offering across the global organization ● Communicate our DE&I strategy. We will share PPG's DE&I vision and strategy so that every employee can help drive continued, sustained progress ​ ​ ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ​ ​ PPG also relaunched and expanded our Employee Resource Networks (ERNs) . We gathered employee feedback through listening sessions and sought external guidance about best-in-class ERN programs. The new structure provides employees with more opportunities to participate and best leverage the unique skills, experiences and perspectives of our team as we continue to build a more inclusive work environment. To best support and promote the success of our ERNs, we have designated executive sponsors from the PPG Operating Committee. ​ PPG’s ERNs comprise: ● Black Employee Network ● Asian Employee Network ● Latinx Employee Network ● Women’s Leadership Network ● Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer (LGBTQ) Network ● Young Professional Network ● Abilities First Network ● Veteran’s Employee Network Our ERN groups will provide an opportunity for more in-depth discussion, focus and recommendations on how PPG can deliver increased growth and performance by creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive organization. Our expanded ERNs will provide employees with a greater voice and more pathways, making DE&I a more integral part of how we do business at PPG. ​ ​ ​ 8 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Furthermore, our business and functional leaders set goals related to diversity and monitor progress on a regular basis. This is supported by specific actions around the world to ensure there is diverse representation on candidate slates. In 2020, approximately 33% of our professional hires globally were female. We will continue to strengthen these actions to attract, hire and promote employees from underrepresented groups . ​ 1,800 Across the globe, we have trained more than 1,800 managers over the past few years on unconscious biases. We are also actively driving diversity recruitment with a focus on representative candidate pools. To broaden the diversity of our talent pools, we recruit at events sponsored by organizations representing diverse candidates. In the U.S., for example, for many years we have taken an active role in the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), participating in its Board of Corporate Affiliates and participating in the Annual Career Fair and Convention, as well as their regional conferences. We also provide PPG Foundation grant money to NSBE’s Summer Engineering Experience for Kids (SEEK) camp, and our interns volunteer at the camps for at least one day. PPG’s intern class for 2020 was 41% female and 37% racially and ethnically diverse. ​ ​ ​ ​ In early 2021, we also received a score of 90% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), a national benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality. Our Workplace Gender Identity and Transition Guidelines, for example, address the needs of transgender employees to ensure their safety and fair treatment, maximize their workplace integration and minimize stigmatization. We scored 90% 2021 Corporate Equality Index Moving forward, PPG is committed to leveraging fact-based/data-driven strategies, initiatives and decision making to understand better demographic and culture opportunities across our workforce. We will continue to listen, accelerate our impact and evolve our aspirational DE&I vision and strategy. We will be accelerating our diversity and inclusion agenda by scaling a holistic global vision and strategy that puts leaders, employees, and the marketplace at the center of our efforts. We plan to establish our initial vision and strategy during the second quarter of 2021. We are working to identify additional metrics and data that the company will disclose in the next year. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 9 ​ Table of Contents Our Communities ​ $3MM When confronted by the extraordinary challenges facing our communities due to COVID-19, PPG and the PPG Foundation made contributions valued at more than $3 million globally to relief efforts that address immediate and emerging challenges in our communities caused by the pandemic. ​ We directed our resources towards: ​ ​ Partnering with leading humanitarian and food service organizations ​ ​ We supported the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and Chinese Red Cross Foundation to fund critical relief efforts in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific regions. We also supported several local foodbanks in communities where PPG has a presence around the world, as well as Feeding America’s efforts in the U.S. to help food banks meet increased community needs. ​ ​ Funding local, on-the-ground recovery efforts ​ ​ We dedicated more than $1 million to support organizations in our communities addressing emerging needs and those hardest hit by the pandemic. In addition, we supported several local organizations focused on reducing the educational challenges faced by students as schools transitioned to virtual learning and many faced food insecurities. ​ ​ Supplying critical resources ​ ​ We made in-kind supply donations of paint, masks, hand sanitizer and more to hospitals and other organizations across our global markets to assist the efforts of our courageous medical community, totaling more than $720,000. As an example, PPG provided 80,000 masks to hospitals in Pittsburgh, New York, Cleveland, Detroit and Huntsville, Alabama, and also donated more than 290 gallons (1,100 liters) of MASTER’S MARK™ anti-bacterial interior latex coatings by PPG to Shanghai Tong Ren Hospital. ​ ​ Activating employee support ​ ​ Employees were encouraged to make personal donations to organizations serving vulnerable populations affected by COVID-19, and the PPG Foundation is providing a 2:1 match. Our work during the pandemic was a continuation of our focus on communities every day. PPG and the PPG Foundation collaborate and engage with employees, community partners and other stakeholders to make our vision of bringing color and brightness to communities a reality. We dedicate financial contributions, apply our products and use the power of our employee volunteers to address the needs of our local communities and transform lives. Our global giving totaled more than $6 million in 2020, supporting hundreds of community organizations across 28 countries. To ensure this investment had the greatest impact, we focused our resources on the areas that we are best positioned to support – education, community sustainability and employee engagement. Our COLORFUL COMMUNITIES TM program represents a 10-year, $10 million commitment, bringing together PPG volunteers, local nonprofits, government organizations, PPG products and financial support to provide a fresh coat of paint, rejuvenated energy and sense of pride to community spaces in need of a refresh. Despite the limited opportunities for in-person projects due to the COVID-19 environment, we completed 28 Colorful Communities projects around the world in 2020. Since the inception of the program in 2016, the company has completed more than 325 projects across 41 countries. ​ ​ ​ 10 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Equality and Social Justice Like many in 2020, we were saddened by the senseless death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and share the frustration of people who are saying, enough is enough as it relates to the discriminatory events and other incidents that have impacted Black Americans and other underrepresented groups over the many years. The demonstrations around the world sent a loud and clear message that we need to do more to create an equal and just society. At our core, PPG is a company that believes in the basic values of human dignity, diversity, equity and inclusion. These are some of our most important values. Racism and discrimination have no place at PPG. We know that our differences make us stronger. As such, PPG leaders quickly set up open communication channels and sharing sessions, some of which included industry experts, to discuss race and DE&I. Our goal, as individuals and as an organization, is to ensure our workforce is inclusive of all backgrounds and reflects the communities in which we live and work. At PPG, we know that a diverse workforce - representing wide-ranging nationalities, cultures, languages, religions, ethnicities, professional and educational experiences and other dimensions - allows us to meet challenges quickly, creatively and effectively. As an organization, we also have delivered financial support to various organizations supporting social justice and DE&I. The PPG Foundation donated to multiple organizations, including NAACP, the Center for Policing Equity, and the Equal Justice Initiative. In addition, the PPG Foundation offered to match U.S. employee donations 2:1 to nonprofit organizations which are working to address equality and racial injustice. We continue to seek areas where we can increase our support and make a difference in the fight for equality. ​ ​ $20MM In 2020, PPG and the PPG Foundation outlined a commitment to invest $20 million by 2025 to address systemic racism and advance racial equity in the U.S. by funding educational pathways for Black communities and people of color. The commitment strengthens PPG's focus on education – a priority giving area for PPG and the PPG Foundation – and furthers its support of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education. The investment will support advanced STEM education and career development programs and curriculums that encourage STEM interest among more K-12 Black students, and students of color. In addition, the investment will assist social justice initiatives that focus on civil rights, criminal justice reform and the cultural heritage of Black communities and people of color; PPG COLORFUL COMMUNITIES® projects that beautify diverse neighborhoods and communities; and opportunities identified by PPG employees, leaders and community partners on an ongoing basis. Through this approach, the PPG Foundation will continue to invest more than 50% of its U.S.-based grantmaking to support causes that focus on Black communities and people of color, veterans, women, LGBTQ+ populations, economically disadvantaged individuals and families, and people with disabilities. We are committing to do even more in the cities and neighborhoods that we call home. We will engage with our communities, our customers and our employees, to listen, learn, and take action. As a global company, PPG can make a difference. Our purpose states that “we protect and beautify the world,” and this has never been more important than now. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 11 ​ Table of Contents Our Environment At PPG, we are committed to using resources efficiently and driving sustainability throughout our entire value chain to preserve and protect the environment. Our focused product portfolio of paints, coatings and specialty materials enables a concerted and disciplined approach to developing sustainable products and processes that provide environmental and other sustainability benefits to our customers. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 Achievements ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Sustainably Advantaged Products ​ ​ Zero Process Waste ​ ​ Waste Efficiency ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 35% ​ ​ 34% ​ ​ ⇩ 42% ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ of sales from products and processes with improved sustainability allowing customers to reduce energy and waste ​ ​ 34% of manufacturing and research and development locations with zero process waste to landfill ​ ​ 42% reduction in the quantity of waste disposed from our 2017 baseline ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Waste Disposal Intensity ​ ​ Spill and Release Rate ​ ​ Greenhouse Gas Emissions ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ⇩ 34% ​ ​ ⇩ 33% ​ ​ ⇩ 24% ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 34% reduction in PPG’s waste disposal intensity from our 2017 baseline, after meeting our 2025 goal in 2019 - 6 years ahead of schedule ​ ​ 33% reduction in PPG’s spill and release rate from our 2017 baseline ​ ​ 24% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from our 2017 baseline Minimizing the footprint of our operations is an ongoing focus, and our locations are guided by our 2025 sustainability goals, outlined at sustainability.ppg.com. Sustainability roadmaps require each location to identify, quantify and track projects that will enable them to meet each environmental goal by the 2025 deadline. One example of our commitment to environmental sustainability comes from PPG’s San Juan del Rio, Mexico facility, which now uses 100% clean energy supplied via a photovoltaic park. The park’s solar panels capture sunlight and transform it into thousands of watts of electricity per second without producing harmful emissions. This project has resulted in a 30% energy savings and a clean-energy certificate from the Mexican government as part of an effort to help the country meet its decarbonization objectives. Furthermore, PPG is working alongside an energy company to develop a combined heat and power plant that will support its automotive and industrial coatings manufacturing facility in Caivano, Italy. Through the partnership, the cogeneration plant will burn natural gas to produce electricity, then recapture the heat that is often lost in conventional power generation facilities. That heat will be transmitted to the PPG plant through a system that connects the two facilities. The plant is expected to begin operations in 2021. In addition to fostering sustainable operations, PPG is committed to driving these practices throughout the product lifecycle. Our Product Stewardship Management System is the bedrock of our process. To ensure sustainable business practices, the management system covers the full scope of the product life cycle – from material sourcing to product ​ ​ ​ 12 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents development and application.

This policy reinforces our expectations that our suppliers, as well as their subcontractors, will comply fully with applicable laws and adhere to internationally recognized environmental, social and corporate-governance standards. Each supplier must evaluate and maintain sustainable processes and raw material sources throughout their supply chain and supplier base. We also encourage our suppliers to innovate and develop new products requiring less intensive material and energy consumption, along with leveraging their collective strengths to help us meet our sustainability goals. To support our supplier sustainability program, PPG has engaged EcoVadis TM , a leading global corporate social responsibility and sustainability ratings company, to leverage assessment processes, tools, resources and insights to drive sustainability standards and practices throughout PPG's global supply base. The EcoVadis sustainability intelligence suite will assist PPG in providing broad-scale supply chain risk screening and mapping, more reliable supplier sustainability metric scorecards with actionable ratings, and complete audit and improvement management capabilities. This evaluation will help to ensure PPG suppliers around the world are equally as committed to sustainability. In addition, suppliers are a focus of our human rights due diligence process. We evaluate their commitment and adherence to human rights through our supplier onboarding process, assessments of our top suppliers globally and annual audits of selected suppliers. We are also an active member of the RESPONSIBLE MICA INITIATIVE ® (RMI), which aims to mobilize the supply chain to eradicate child labor in India’s mica mines through traceability efforts and community-building activities. RMI’s holistic approach implements three program pillars simultaneously: ● Mica supply chain mapping and workplace standards for mica collection and processing; ● Community empowerment, including improved educational resources and alternative means of livelihood, in villages that provide the mica workforce; and ● Legal frameworks for the mica sector . Additional information about the steps we have taken to ensure human rights are respected in our own operations and within our supply chain can be found in our California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Statement and Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, available at PPG.com Employees, suppliers and other third parties can anonymously report suspected human rights violations within our operations and those of our suppliers through the PPG Ethics Helpline. The helpline is managed by an independent, third-party firm, and we investigate each allegation thoroughly and fairly. In the event of any non-compliant activity or violation of the code, the supplier may be required to provide a detailed corrective action plan to address the deficiency. We reserve the right to terminate any agreement with any supplier that cannot demonstrate compliance with the code. ​ ​ ​ 14 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Recognition PPG’s leadership and progress in key environmental, social and governance (ESG) areas has been recognized by reputable external organizations.

It is intended that the shares represented by each proxy will be voted, in the discretion of the proxies, FOR the nominees for directors set forth below, each of whom is an incumbent, or for any substitute nominee or nominees designated by our Board of Directors in the event any nominee or nominees become unavailable for election. In the event that an incumbent director receives a greater number of votes against their election than votes for such election, they are required to tender their resignation for consideration by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors in accordance with our Bylaws, as under “Director Resignation Policy.” The principal occupations of, and certain other information regarding, the nominees and our continuing directors are set forth below. In addition, information about each director’s specific experience, attributes and skills that led the Board to the conclusion that each of the directors is highly qualified to serve as a member of the Board is set forth below. The Board believes that each of the Company’s directors is highly qualified to serve as a member of the Board. Each of our directors has contributed to the mix of skills, core competencies and qualifications of the Board. Our directors are highly educated and have diverse backgrounds and talents and extensive track records of success in what we believe are highly relevant positions with some of the most admired organizations in the world. Many of our directors also benefit from an intimate knowledge of our operations and corporate philosophy. The Board believes that each director’s service as the chairman, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, president, chief financial officer, group president or executive vice president of a well-respected company has provided the directors with skills that are important to serving on our Board. The Board has also considered the fact that all of our directors have worked for, or served on the boards of directors of, a variety of companies in a wide range of industries. Specifically, the Board has noted that our directors have skills that, among others, have made them particularly suited to serve as a director of PPG, a global manufacturer and retailer of high technology paints, coatings and specialty materials for industrial and consumer markets, with operations in more than 70 countries and nearly $14 billion in sales. The Board believes that through their varying backgrounds, our directors bring a wealth of experiences, new ideas and solutions to our Board. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors elected Michael T. Nally and Guillermo Novo as directors of PPG, effective that day, and assigned them to the class of directors whose term expires at the 2024 Annual Meeting. PPG’s Board is divided into three classes. Terms of the classes are staggered, with one class standing for election each year. The Board assigned Messrs. Nally and Novo to the class of directors whose term expires at the 2024 Annual Meeting as a matter of good corporate governance to bring these new directors before the Company’s shareholders at the next annual meeting after their election to the Board. PPG’s Articles of Incorporation currently provide that the Board shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible with members of each class serving for three-year terms. Because the addition of Messrs. Nally and Novo to the class of directors standing for election at the 2021 Annual Meeting created an imbalance in the membership of the three classes, the Board of Directors will re-balance the membership of the classes after the 2021 Annual Meeting. Vote Required Each director nominee who receives a majority of the votes cast (the number of shares voted “for” the director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director) at the Annual Meeting will be elected as a director. THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE DIRECTOR NOMINEES. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 18 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Nominees to Serve in a Class Whose Term Expires in 2024 Steven A.

McGarry ​ Board’s Emphasis on Strategy PPG’s Board is actively engaged in developing our strategy and overseeing its execution, including major business and organizational initiatives, capital allocation priorities and potential business development opportunities. The Board devotes at least one full day each year to reviewing and formulating our strategy. Throughout the year, the Board uses its experience in manufacturing, global business, science and technology and marketing to oversee the execution of our strategy and capital allocation and works with senior management to guide our strategy. Independent Lead Director: Hugh Grant ​ ​ Meetings: 8 regular and 3 special ​ 12 of 13 PPG Directors are Independent ​ ​ √ Our independent directors meet separately, without any management present, at each meeting of the Board. ​ √ Each of the Board’s standing committees regularly meets without members of management present. ​ √ Management succession is regularly discussed by the Board with Mr. McGarry and with PPG’s Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. ​ √ The Lead Director presides over the independent director sessions at each meeting and facilitates communications and serves as a liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman and CEO. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 98% ​ The average attendance at meetings of the Board and committees during 2020 was 98%, and no incumbent director attended less than 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and committees on which such director served. PPG does not have a formal policy requiring attendance at the annual meeting of shareholders; however, all directors serving at the time of the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, other than James G. Berges who retired at the 2020 annual meeting, attended the meeting. Board Composition, Refreshment and Diversity PPG’s business, property and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. The Board is currently comprised of 13 members, divided into three classes. Terms of the classes are staggered, with one class standing for election each year. The Board has placed on the ballot for the Annual Meeting a proposal to amend PPG’s Articles of Incorporation to provide for the annual election of all directors. Please see Proposal 3 for more information. The Board is elected by our shareholders to oversee management of the Company in the long-term interests of all shareholders. The Board also considers the interests of other stakeholders, which include customers, employees, retirees, suppliers, the communities we serve and the environment. The Board strives to ensure that PPG conducts business in accordance with the highest standards of ethics and integrity. ​ ​ ​ 26 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents The Board seeks to maintain an appropriate balance of directors with varying tenure, diversity and skills. The Nominating and Governance Committee continually evaluates potential director candidates with the goal of finding directors whose skills complement the skills of PPG’s current directors, who add to the expertise of the Board as a whole and who have experience to contribute insight into our strategy. Using a skills matrix that includes the experience and skills of our current directors and keeping in mind the skills that the Board believes would add to the capabilities and knowledge of our Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee regularly reviews the skills and experience of our directors and potential director candidates. More information about the skills and experience of our directors can be found in the matrix on page 17 and within the biographies of our directors beginning on page 19. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that any director who has attained the age of 72 retire at the next annual meeting following the director's 72nd birthday. Nine new directors have joined the Board since 2015. Since the end of 2012, the average age of our directors has decreased from 64 to 61 and our average director tenure has decreased from approximately 10 years to approximately five years. Although our average tenure has fallen with the addition of new directors, the Board believes that it is important to have longer-serving directors on the Board who have an intimate knowledge of our operations and our corporate philosophy. These longer-serving directors have also guided PPG through the peaks and troughs of the business cycle and can share this experience with our newer directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not a have formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director candidates. However, we endeavor to have a Board representing diverse experience at policy-making levels in business, government, education and technology, and in areas that are relevant to the Company’s global activities. The Nominating and Governance Committee seeks to find director candidates who have demonstrated executive leadership ability and who are representative of the broad scope of shareholder interests by identifying candidates from varied industries having diverse cultural or ethnic backgrounds, viewpoints and ages. The Nominating and Governance Committee believes that the current members of the Board provide this diversity as discussed more specifically on page 16. Director Independence In accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Board affirmatively determines the independence of each director and nominee for election or appointment as a director in accordance with the categorical guidelines it has adopted, which include all objective standards of independence set forth in the exchange listing standards. Based on these standards, at its meeting held on February 18, 2021, the Board determined that each of the following non-employee directors is independent and has no material relationship with PPG, except as a director and shareholder: ​ ​ Stephen F. Angel Michael W. Lamach Steven A. Davis Kathleen A. Ligocki John V. Faraci Michael T. Nally Hugh Grant Guillermo Novo Melanie L. Healey Martin H. Richenhagen Gary R. Heminger Catherine R. Smith In addition, based on such standards, the Board affirmatively determined that Michael H. McGarry is not independent because he is an officer of PPG. The categorical independence standards adopted by the Board are contained in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, which may be accessed from the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor. Board Leadership Structure We believe our Board leadership structure provides the appropriate balance of independent directors and management directors. We have a traditional board leadership structure under which Mr. McGarry serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. A combined position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is only one element of our leadership structure, which also includes an independent Lead Director and active, independent non-employee directors. We currently have 12 non-employee directors, each of whom is independent. Our Board has four standing committees, each of which is comprised solely of independent directors with a committee chair. The Board has determined that the appropriate structure for the Board at this time is for Mr. McGarry, our Chief Executive Officer, to serve as Chairman of the Board, while also providing for the counterbalance of a strong independent Lead Director role, fully independent Board committees, and other good governance practices. The Board believes that Mr. McGarry is the best person to serve as Chairman because he is the director most familiar with our business and industry and the director most capable of identifying strategic priorities and executing our ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 27 ​ Table of Contents business strategy. The Board believes the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer serves as a highly effective bridge between the Board and management and provides the leadership to execute our business strategy and create shareholder value. In addition, having one person serve as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer demonstrates to our employees, suppliers, customers, shareholders and other stakeholders that PPG has strong leadership setting the tone and having the responsibility for managing our operations. Having a single leader eliminates the potential for confusion and provides clear leadership for PPG. For example, as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded having Mr. McGarry serve as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer allowed us to quickly build consensus around the steps necessary to protect our employees and our business. Our Board consists of directors with significant leadership skills, as discussed above. All of our independent directors have served as the chairman, chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, group president or executive vice president of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that our independent directors have demonstrated leadership in large enterprises and are well versed in board processes and that having directors with significant leadership skills benefits our Company and our shareholders. In accordance with our Bylaws and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Chairman is responsible for chairing Board meetings and setting the agenda for these meetings. Each director also may suggest items for inclusion on the agenda and may raise at any Board meeting subjects that are not on the agenda for that meeting. As required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our independent directors meet separately, without management present, at each meeting of the Board. In addition, each of the Board’s standing committees regularly meets without members of management present. The Board has designated the chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee to serve as the Lead Director. In their discretion, the independent directors may select another independent director to serve as the Lead Director. Aside from chairing meetings of the independent directors, the Lead Director: ● presides at all meetings where the Chairman is not present; ● facilitates communications and serves as a liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; ● has the power to call meetings of the independent directors; ● communicates to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer any suggestions, views or concerns expressed by the independent directors and consults with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer about the concerns of the Board; ● advises the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as to the information necessary or appropriate for the independent directors to effectively and responsibly perform their duties and provide feedback on the quality, quantity and timeliness of information submitted by management; ● approves Board meeting agendas and other types of information sent to the Board; ● approves meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; ● is available for consultation and direct communication with major shareholders as appropriate; ● participates in the identification and evaluation of director candidates and facilitates director development; ● acts as a resource and advisor to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; ● unless otherwise directed by the Board, serves as the independent directors’ representative in extraordinary matters such as significant corporate transactions and crisis situations; ● recommends to the Board the formation and membership of ad-hoc committees of the Board to oversee extraordinary matters such as significant corporate transactions and crisis situations; ● authorizes the retention of outside advisors and consultants who report directly to the Board on Board-wide issues; and ● performs such other duties as the Board may from time to time designate. As part of its annual self-evaluation process, the Board, at least annually, evaluates our leadership structure to ensure that it provides the optimal structure for PPG. We believe that having a director with day-to-day oversight of Company operations, coupled with experienced independent directors who have appointed a Lead Director and four wholly-independent board committees, is the appropriate leadership structure for PPG. ​ ​ ​ ​ 28 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Shareholder Engagement ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Through engagement with our shareholders, the Board and our senior management team are provided with feedback on a variety of topics, including: ● strategic and financial performance ● operations ● corporate governance ● executive compensation ● Board composition ● environmental and social topics ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Percentage of our outstanding shares held by active, institutional investors with whom we met in 2020. ​ ​ Percentage of our outstanding shares held by institutional investors with whom we held governance-focused meetings in 2020. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ These constructive engagements enable the Board and management to evaluate and assess our company from different perspectives and viewpoints. Our Lead Director, Hugh Grant, participated in a number of these governance-focused meetings. The key themes of feedback received during our engagement meetings as well as efforts we are taking in consideration of the feedback we received were shared with the Board. These initiatives help to ensure that the Board is apprised of key trends and topics being considered by our shareholders. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our engagement efforts reached holders of slightly fewer shares in 2020. A general outline of our approach to shareholder engagement can be found below. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Before the Annual Meeting of Shareholders At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders After the Annual Meeting of Shareholders ● We reach out to investors to discuss key issues facing our company and industry ● Together, the Board and senior management discuss shareholder feedback and determine if additional actions are required ● Management institutes changes as appropriate ​ Our shareholders: ● elect eligible nominees to join the Board of Directors ● vote on executive compensation ● vote on the ratification of our auditors ● potentially vote on other proposals brought by management or by our shareholders ​ ● We tabulate and review the voting results ● Together, the Board and senior management discuss the results and determine what additional actions are appropriate ● We prepare our agenda for further shareholder engagement ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 29 ​ Table of Contents The Board’s Role in Our Sustainability and Our Culture Our Board is actively engaged in our sustainability and corporate culture programs and initiatives. Our sustainability approach is grounded in our vision of delivering lasting value for stakeholders and customers by operating with integrity, working safely, respecting the contributions of our people, preserving the environment and supporting the communities where we operate. Our Sustainability Committee, a committee of management consisting of senior corporate executives, establishes our sustainability goals as well as policies, programs and procedures to address sustainability in our business practices. The Board’s long-standing Technology and Environment Committee oversees the work of the Sustainability Committee, PPG’s environmental sustainability efforts, performance against our sustainability goals and the development new sustainability-advantaged technologies and products. The Technology and Environment Committee also oversees our product stewardship program that seeks to limit our use of certain chemicals of concern and the progress of our environmental remediation projects. Our Board recognizes the importance of PPG’s corporate culture and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to our success. The Board has been focused on employee engagement and provided its guidance in connection with the formulation and introduction of The PPG Way. Since the introduction of The PPG Way, the Board has received regular updates on our engagement progress. The Board has also endorsed our recent diversity, equity and inclusion actions, including hiring an executive level Global Head of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion and the PPG Foundation’s recent donations to organizations focusing on social justice. Our aim is to bring color and brightness to communities around the world. The PPG Foundation is the primary vehicle for our community engagement efforts. The PPG Foundation distributes over $6 million in donations annually and manages our COLORFUL COMMUNITIES TM program. The Board has oversight responsibility for the PPG Foundation and also receives updates on PPG’s other global giving initiatives. Board Oversight of PPG’s Strategy PPG’s Board is actively engaged in developing our strategy and overseeing the execution of our strategy, including major business and organizational initiatives, capital allocation priorities and potential business development opportunities. The Board devotes at least one full day each year to reviewing and formulating our strategy. Throughout the year, the Board uses its experience in manufacturing, global business, science and technology and marketing to oversee the execution of our strategy and capital allocation and works with senior management to guide our strategy. At each Board meeting and during our annual strategy session, directors engage with PPG’s senior leadership in robust discussions about the Company’s overall strategy, priorities for its businesses, and long-term growth opportunities. The Board’s Role in Risk Management Management Our management team is responsible for the day-to-day management of risk. Board of Directors Our Board has broad oversight responsibility for our risk-management programs. While the Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing our enterprise risk assessment and management process, our entire Board is actively involved in overseeing risk management for the Company by engaging in periodic discussions with Company officers and other employees as the Board may deem appropriate. We believe that the leadership structure of our Board supports the Board’s effective oversight of the Company’s risk management. ​ ​ ​ Audit Committee Focuses on risks inherent in our accounting, financial reporting, legal and regulatory compliance, cybersecurity and internal controls. ​ Technology and Environment Committee Considers risks related to our environment, health, safety, product stewardship and other sustainability policies, programs and practices. ​ Officers—Directors Compensation Committee Considers the risks that may be implicated by our executive compensation program. ​ ​ ​ ​ 30 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Special Role of Audit Committee: ● In accordance with New York Stock Exchange requirements, our Audit Committee charter provides that the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our risk management process. ● The Audit Committee is updated on a regular basis on relevant and significant risk areas. This includes periodic updates from certain officers of the Company and a formal annual update by the Director of Corporate Audit Services. The annual update provides a comprehensive review of PPG’s enterprise risks and includes the feedback of most of the Company’s officers and key managers. The Audit Committee, in turn, reports to the full Board. Executive Succession Planning One of the Board’s primary responsibilities is to oversee the development of appropriate executive-level talent to successfully execute PPG’s strategy. Management succession is regularly discussed by the Board with Mr. McGarry and with PPG’s Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. The Board reviews candidates for all executive officer positions to confirm that qualified successor-candidates are available for all key positions and that development plans are being utilized to strengthen the skills and qualifications of successor-candidates. At least annually, as required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and typically more often, the Board’s discusses CEO succession planning. Mr. McGarry provides the Board with recommendations for and evaluations of potential CEO successors and reviews with the Board development plans for these successors. Directors engage with potential CEO and senior management talent at Board and committee meetings and in less formal settings to enable directors to personally interact with candidates. The Board reviews management succession in the ordinary course of business as well as contingency planning in the event of an emergency or unanticipated event. Corporate Governance Guidelines, Board Self-Evaluation and Board Orientation The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines are revised from time to time to better address particular needs as they change over time. The Board revised the Corporate Governance Guidelines in 2020 to reflect updated and additional responsibilities for the Lead Director. The Corporate Governance Guidelines may be accessed from the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor. The Board annually evaluates its own performance and that of the individual committees. The evaluation process is coordinated by the Nominating and Governance Committee and has three parts: committee self-assessments, full Board evaluations and evaluations of the individual directors in the class whose term is expiring at the next annual meeting. The committee self-assessments consider whether and how well each committee has performed the responsibilities listed in its charter. The full Board evaluations consider the committee self-assessments as well as the quality of the Board’s meeting agendas, materials and discussions. All assessments and evaluations focus on both strengths and opportunities for improvement and are shared with the Board. The Board has a program for orienting new directors which includes presentations from members of senior management regarding our operations, technologies, governance, finances, compensation programs and other topics of interest to our new directors. The Company also provides for continuing education for all directors, including the reimbursement of expenses for continuing education. Director Resignation Policy Our Bylaws provide that if an incumbent director is not elected by majority vote in an “uncontested election” (where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected), the director must offer to tender his or her resignation to our Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee would then make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee’s recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date the election results are certified. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board’s decision with respect to their resignation. The election of directors that will be held at the 2021 Annual Meeting is an uncontested election. Review and Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons The Board and its Nominating and Governance Committee have adopted written policies and procedures relating to approval or ratification of “Related Person Transactions.” Under these policies and procedures, the Nominating and Governance Committee (or its chair, under some circumstances) reviews the relevant facts of all proposed Related ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 31 ​ Table of Contents Person Transactions and either approves or disapproves of the Related Person Transaction, by taking into account, among other factors it deems appropriate: ● The benefits to PPG of the transaction; ● The impact on a director’s independence, in the event the “Related Person” is a director or an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder or executive officer; ● The availability of other sources for comparable products or services; ● The terms of the transaction; and ● The terms available to unrelated third parties or to employees generally. No director may participate in any consideration or approval of a Related Person Transaction with respect to which he or she or any of his or her immediate family members is the Related Person. Related Person Transactions are approved only if they are determined to be in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of PPG and its shareholders. If a Related Person Transaction that has not been previously approved or previously ratified is discovered, the Nominating and Governance Committee, or its chair, will promptly consider all of the relevant facts. In addition, the committee generally reviews all ongoing Related Person Transactions on an annual basis to determine whether to continue, modify or terminate the Related Person Transaction. Under our policies and procedures, a “Related Person Transaction” is generally a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which PPG was, is or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any Related Person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. A “Related Person” is generally any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of PPG’s last fiscal year was, (i) a director or executive officer of PPG or a nominee to become a director of PPG; (ii) any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of PPG’s voting securities; or (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions As discussed above, the Nominating and Governance Committee is charged with reviewing potential conflicts of interest and all Related Person Transactions. PPG and its subsidiaries purchase products and services from and/or sell products and services to companies of which certain of the directors and/or executive officers of PPG are directors and/or executive officers. During 2020, PPG entered into the following transactions with Related Persons that are required to be reported under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission: Stephen F. Angel, a director of PPG, is the Chief Executive Officer and a director of Linde plc.

The committee’s charter, which may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor, describes the composition, purposes and responsibilities of the committee. Among other things, the charter provides that the committee will be comprised of independent, non-employee directors. The functions of the committee are primarily to review with our independent auditors and our internal auditors their respective reports and recommendations concerning audit findings and the scope of and plans for their future audit programs and to review audits, annual and quarterly financial statements and accounting and financial controls. The committee also appoints our independent registered public accounting firm, oversees our internal audit department, assists the Board in oversight of our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to financial reporting matters and oversees the risk management process. The Board has determined that each member of the committee is “financially literate” in accordance with the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the Board has determined that all of the members of the committee, including Ms. Smith, the chair of the committee, are “audit committee financial experts” in accordance with the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Audit Committee Report to Shareholders The primary role of the Audit Committee is to oversee and review on behalf of the Board of Directors PPG’s processes to provide for the reliability and integrity of the Company’s financial reporting, including the Company’s disclosure ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 33 ​ Table of Contents practices, risk management processes and internal controls. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and PPG’s lead internal auditor, the Director of Corporate Audit Services. In addition, the Audit Committee led the appointment and retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as PPG’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2020. In 2018, the Audit Committee participated in the selection process for a new lead audit partner due to the required rotation of PPG’s current lead audit partner after completion of the 2017 audit. For the work performed on the 2020 audit, the Audit Committee discussed and evaluated PricewaterhouseCoopers’ performance, which included an evaluation by the Company’s management of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ performance. The Audit Committee is responsible for the compensation of the independent registered public accounting firm and has reviewed and approved in advance all services performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Audit Committee discussed with, and received regular status reports from, the Director of Corporate Audit Services and PricewaterhouseCoopers on the overall scope and plans for their audits, their plans for evaluating the effectiveness of PPG’s internal control over financial reporting and the coordination of efforts between them. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the key risk factors used in developing PPG’s internal audit and PricewaterhouseCoopers’ audit plans. The Audit Committee also reviewed with the Company’s management PPG’s risk management practices and an assessment of significant risks. The Audit Committee met separately with the Vice President and Controller, the Director of Corporate Audit Services and PricewaterhouseCoopers, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their audits of PPG’s financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and the overall quality of PPG’s financial reporting. The Audit Committee also met separately with the Company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and with the Company’s Senior Vice President and General Counsel. The Audit Committee annually reviews its performance and receives feedback on its performance from the Company’s management and PricewaterhouseCoopers, when appropriate. The Company’s management is responsible for the preparation and accuracy of PPG’s financial statements. The Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. In 2020, PPG’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, was responsible for auditing the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of PPG’s internal control over financial reporting. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with the Company’s management the process to assemble the financial statements, including the Company’s internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and management’s report on internal control over financial reporting with management and with PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Audit Committee also discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers the matters required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee has received the written independence disclosures and letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers its independence. In addition, the Audit Committee considered whether PricewaterhouseCoopers’ provision of non-audit services to PPG is compatible with maintaining its independence. Based upon these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Lamach ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Responsibilities: ​ ​ ● reviews the Company’s corporate governance framework, including all significant governance policies and procedures ● identifies and recommends nominees to stand for election as directors at each annual meeting of shareholders and recommends nominees to fill any vacancies on the Board or executive management team ● recommends actions to be taken regarding the structure, organization and functioning of the Board, including membership of the Board committees ● develops corporate governance guidelines, including the process and criteria to be used in evaluating the performance of the Board ● reviews the performance of Board ● reviews the performance of the committees of the Board and the adequacy of the committees’ charters The Nominating and Governance Committee is comprised entirely of directors who are independent under the standards adopted by the Board and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The committee’s charter, which may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor, describes the composition, purposes and responsibilities of the committee. Among other things, the charter provides that the committee recommends to the Board actions to be taken regarding the structure, organization and functioning of the Board, and the persons to serve as members of the standing committees of, and other committees appointed by, the Board. The charter gives the committee the responsibility to develop and recommend corporate governance guidelines to the Board, to recommend to the Board the process and criteria to be used in evaluating the performance of the Board and to oversee the evaluation of the Board. Director Candidates The Nominating and Governance Committee considers recommendations of potential director candidates from current directors, management and shareholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee also has authority to retain and terminate search firms to assist in identifying director candidates. From time to time, search firms have been paid a fee to identify candidates. In February 2021, the Board of Directors elected Messrs. Nally and Novo as a directors of PPG. Mr. Nally was initially brought to the attention of the Board as a potential director candidate by a search firm that contacted Mr. Grant. Mr. Novo was initially identified as a potential director candidate by a search firm used by the Nominating and Governance Committee to identify potential director candidates. The Nominating and Governance Committee then recommended that Mr. McGarry interview Messrs. Nally and Novo, and Mr. McGarry invited them to meet with other members of the Board. Following meetings with a number of other directors and a review of their ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 35 ​ Table of Contents candidacy by the Nominating and Governance Committee, Messrs. Nally and Novo were recommended by the Nominating and Governance Committee for election to the Board. Director Candidate Attributes In evaluating director candidates, the committee looks for candidates having the skills that the Board believes would add to the capabilities and knowledge of our Board, including the skills and attributes set forth below: ● age shall be considered only in terms of experience of the candidate, seeking candidates who have broad experience in business, finance, the sciences, administration, government affairs or law; ● candidates for director should have knowledge of the global operations of industrial and retail businesses such as those of PPG; ● candidates for director should be cognizant of PPG’s societal responsibilities in conducting its operations; ● each candidate should have sufficient time available to be a meaningful participant in Board affairs. Candidates should not be considered if there is either a legal impediment to service or a foreseeable conflict of interest which might materially hamper full and objective participation in all matters considered by the Board of Directors; ● absent unforeseen health problems, each candidate should be able to serve as director for a sufficient period of time to make a meaningful contribution to the Board’s guidance of PPG’s affairs; and ● the Board will be comprised of a majority of independent directors. In applying these criteria, the committee seeks to establish a Board that, when taken as a whole, should: ● be representative of the broad scope of shareholder interests, without orientation to any particular constituencies; ● challenge management, in a constructive way, to reach PPG’s goals and objectives; ● be sensitive to the cultural and geographical diversity of shareholders, associates, operations and interests; ● be comprised principally of active or retired senior executives of publicly held corporations or financial institutions, with consideration given to those individuals who are scientifically-oriented, educators and government officials having corporate experience, whenever the needs of PPG indicate such membership would be appropriate; ● include directors of varying ages, but whose overriding credentials reflect maturity, experience, insight and prominence in the community; and ● be small enough to promote open and meaningful boardroom discussion, but large enough to staff the necessary Board committees. Shareholder Recommendations or Nominations for Director and Proxy Access The Nominating and Governance Committee considers recommendations of potential candidates from shareholders. Candidates recommended by shareholders are evaluated against the same criteria used to evaluate all candidates. Shareholders wishing to recommend or nominate a nominee for director should send their recommendation or nomination to the corporate secretary at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272. PPG’s Bylaws provide for “proxy access.” Proxy access is a process that allows an eligible shareholder or a group of eligible shareholders to nominate director candidates to appear in PPG’s proxy materials. Proxy access is available to shareholders or groups consisting of no more than 20 shareholders that have held at least 3% of PPG’s outstanding stock for at least three years and who have met the other requirements set forth in Article I of PPG’s Bylaws. A shareholder recommendation or nomination of a director candidate must be submitted by the deadlines and with the information and written representations that are described in Article I of our Bylaws. Director nominations submitted pursuant to PPG’s proxy access Bylaw for consideration at the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders must be received by PPG no earlier than October 5, 2021 and no later than November 4, 2021. A copy of PPG’s Bylaws may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor. ​ ​ ​ ​ 36 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents OFFICERS-DIRECTORS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ​ Primary Role of this Committee: The primary role of the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee is to oversee the compensation of PPG’s executive officers and directors and to set objectives for incentive-based compensation for our executive officers.

The committee’s charter, which may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor, describes the composition, purposes and responsibilities of the committee. Among other things, the charter provides that the committee will be comprised of independent, non-employee directors. The committee approves, adopts, administers, interprets, amends, suspends and terminates our compensation plans applicable to, and establishes the compensation and benefits of, all of our directors and executive officers. Recommendations regarding compensation of other officers are made by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The conclusions reached and recommendations based on these reviews, including with respect to salary adjustments and annual award amounts, are presented to the committee. The committee can exercise its discretion in modifying any recommended adjustments or awards to executives. Committee meetings are regularly attended by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, as well as a representative of the outside compensation consulting firm retained by the committee, FW Cook. At each meeting, the committee meets in executive session. The committee’s chair reports the committee’s recommendations on executive compensation to the Board. The human resources department supports the committee in its duties, along with the Company’s Compensation and Employee Benefits Committee, a committee comprised of members of senior management that may be delegated authority to fulfill certain administrative duties regarding our compensation programs. The committee has authority under its charter to retain, approve fees for and terminate advisors, consultants and agents as it deems necessary to assist in the fulfillment of its responsibilities. Independent Compensation Consultant to the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee The committee engaged FW Cook to advise the committee on all matters related to executive officer and director compensation. Specifically, FW Cook provides relevant market data, current updates regarding trends in executive and director compensation, and advice on program design, specific compensation recommendations for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and on the recommendations being made by management for executives other than the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The committee meets independently with its consultant at each regularly scheduled meeting. All of the services that the compensation consultant performs for PPG are performed at the request of the committee, are related to executive and director compensation and are in support of decision making by the committee. In 2020, the committee considered the independence of FW Cook in light of Securities and Exchange Commission rules and New York Stock Exchange listing standards. The committee requested and received a letter from FW Cook ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 37 ​ Table of Contents addressing FW Cook’s and the senior advisor involved in the engagement’s independence, including the following factors: (1) other services provided to us by FW Cook; (2) fees paid by us as a percentage of FW Cook’s total revenue; (3) policies or procedures maintained by FW Cook that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest; (4) any business or personal relationships between the senior advisor and a member of the committee; (5) any company stock owned by FW Cook or the senior advisor; and (6) any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and FW Cook or the senior advisor. The committee discussed these considerations and concluded that the work performed by FW Cook and FW Cook’s senior advisor involved in the engagement did not raise any conflict of interest. Officers—Directors Compensation Committee Report to Shareholders We have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement with management. Based on our review and discussion with management, we have recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Officers—Directors Compensation Committee: Stephen F. Angel (Chair) John V. Faraci Hugh Grant Michael W. Lamach Martin H.

Compensation Program Design Mitigates Risk In 2020, the Company’s management undertook a review of all of PPG’s compensation programs to identify any inherent material risks to PPG created by these programs. Based on the results of this review, we concluded that the design of our compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long-term value of PPG. For more information about this review and the features of our compensation program that mitigate risk, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Program Design Mitigates Risk.” Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation No member of the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee was at any time during 2020 an officer or employee of PPG or any of our subsidiaries nor is any such person a former officer of PPG or any of our subsidiaries. In addition, no “Officers-Directors Compensation Committee interlocks” existed during 2020.

Codes of Ethics Our Global Code of Ethics, which was updated in 2017, is applicable to all directors and employees worldwide. The Global Code of Ethics embodies our principles and practices relating to the ethical conduct of our business and our long-standing commitment to honesty, fair dealing and compliance with all laws affecting our business. We also have a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that is applicable to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller or persons performing similar functions. The Global Code of Ethics and Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers are available on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor. In addition, we intend to post on our website all disclosures that are required by law, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Form 8-K rules or the New York Stock Exchange listing standards concerning any amendments to, or waivers from, any provision of our codes. The Board has established a means for employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders or other interested parties to submit confidential and anonymous reports of suspected or actual violations of our Global Code of Ethics. Any employee, shareholder or other interested party can call the PPG Ethics HELPLINE toll-free to submit a report. In North America, this number is (800) 461-9330. This number is operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week. PPG Ethics HELPLINE numbers for other regions may be found on the Ethics page of our website at www.ppg.com/ethics. Communications with the Board Shareholders and other interested parties may send communications to the Board, the independent directors (individually or as a group) or the Lead Director in writing by sending them in care of our corporate secretary at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272. All communications received will be opened by the corporate secretary for the sole purpose of determining whether the contents represent a message to directors. Communications deemed by the corporate secretary to be frivolous or otherwise inappropriate for the Board’s consideration will not be forwarded. The corporate secretary will maintain a log of all such communications. Communications of an urgent nature are promptly reported to the Board. Communications to directors may also be forwarded within PPG for review by a subject matter expert. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 39 ​ Table of Contents COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS Overview The compensation program for our directors who are not also officers of PPG, to whom we refer as non-employee directors, is reviewed annually by the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee to ensure that the program remains competitive. As a part of the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee’s review, the types and levels of compensation offered to our non-employee directors are compared with those provided by a select group of comparable companies. Target total annual compensation for our directors is set at or near the market median using a comparator group of companies. The companies comprising this comparator group are used for review of the executive officer compensation program as well. The comparator group used in 2019 to set 2020 compensation was: ​ ​ ​ ​ 3M Company Eaton Corporation plc Illinois Tool Works Inc. The Sherwin-Williams Company Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Ecolab Inc. International Paper Company Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Arconic Inc. Emerson Electric Co. Johnson Controls International plc Textron Inc. Celanese Corporation Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Linde plc ​ Eastman Chemical Company Honeywell International Inc. Parker-Hannifin Corporation ​ Taking into consideration the size of PPG relative to this comparator group and advice from FW Cook, the Officers- Directors Compensation Committee reports its recommendations to the Board for approval. The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee does not determine director compensation, but only makes recommendations to the Board. Changes to the non-employee directors’ compensation program generally become effective as of the year following adoption.

For 2020, the annual retainer for service as a committee chair or as the Lead Director was as follows: $25,000 for the chair of the Audit Committee; $25,000 for the Lead Director; $20,000 for the chair of each of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee; and $15,000 for the chair of the Technology and Environment Committee. (2) In April 2020, each director received 1,636 time-based restricted stock units, or RSUs. The RSUs will vest on April 14, 2021 and the grant date fair value of each RSU grant was $88.63. Dollar values represent the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The assumptions made in calculating the grant date fair values are ​ ​ ​ 40 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents set forth in Note 19 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is located on pages 70 through 72 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2020, each director had 1,636 unvested RSUs. (3) Amounts in this column reflect donations made by the PPG Industries Foundation under our charitable awards program. The PPG Industries Foundation matches donations, up to $10,000 per year in most cases, made by a director in any one year. However, matching payments by the PPG Industries Foundation may be paid in a year subsequent to the donation depending on the timing of the director’s donation during the year and the timing of the PPG Industries Foundation's verification process.  This may result in matching payments that exceed $10,000 in one year. For additional information regarding charitable awards, see "Charitable Awards Program." (4) Mr. Berges and Mss. Haynes and Hooper retired from the PPG Board of Directors effective April 16, 2020. As such, these directors received no annual retainer or committee chair retainer for the year ended December 31, 2020. Annual Retainer For 2020, each of our non-employee directors received an annual retainer with a value equal to $280,000, of which $135,000 was paid in cash and $145,000 in equity in the form of time-based restricted stock units, or TBRSUs. The cash portion of the retainer was payable in quarterly installments, with the first quarterly installment paid after the annual meeting of shareholders. The number of TBRSUs a director received was determined by dividing $145,000 by the weighted average closing price of our stock on the grant date, which was the date of the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. A TBRSU represents the right to receive a share of PPG common stock upon vesting and earns dividend equivalents during the vesting period when dividends are declared on PPG common stock, but does not carry voting rights or other rights afforded to a holder of PPG common stock. TBRSUs granted in 2020 vest on the day prior to the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Additional Retainers for Committee Chairs and the Lead Director In addition to the annual retainer for each non-employee director, each non-employee director who chairs a Board standing committee is entitled to an additional annual cash retainer, which is payable at the same time as the regular annual retainer. The Lead Director also receives an additional cash retainer in recognition of the additional time and effort required by the role, including, among other responsibilities, planning Board meetings, meeting with management and engaging with our shareholders. For 2020, the additional annual retainers for service as a committee chair or as the Lead Director were: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ RETAINER COMMITTEE ​ AMOUNT Audit ​ $ 25,000 Lead Director ​ $ 25,000 Nominating and Governance ​ $ 20,000 Officers—Directors Compensation ​ $ 20,000 Technology and Environment ​ $ 15,000 Insurance Coverage We pay the premiums to provide each of our non-employee directors with the following insurance coverage: ● Accidental death and dismemberment insurance coverage, which provides $250,000 for accidental loss of life, and up to 100% of the death benefit for loss of limb. The aggregate cost to PPG of providing this coverage to non-employee directors for 2020 was $1,170; and ● PPG aircraft travel insurance coverage, which provides up to a $1,000,000 per seat voluntary settlement allowance, for travel on a PPG-owned aircraft, and a reduced amount for travel on a PPG leased or chartered aircraft. The aggregate cost to PPG of providing this coverage to non-employee directors for 2020 was $17,105. Deferred Compensation A non-employee director may elect to have all or a portion of his or her retainer fees (including fees payable in TBRSUs) credited to the PPG Industries, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, thus deferring receipt of such fees until after the director leaves the Board. All amounts held in a director’s account under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited as hypothetical shares of our stock, or what we refer to as common stock equivalents, the number of which is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the deferral by the closing stock price of PPG common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of the deferral. Common stock equivalents earn dividend equivalents (that are ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 41 ​ Table of Contents converted into additional common stock equivalents) when dividends are declared on PPG common stock, but do not carry voting rights or other rights afforded to a holder of PPG common stock. Each non-employee director will generally be paid his or her deferred compensation account balance no earlier than six months and ten days after leaving the Board of Directors, except in circumstances of death or disability, in which case payment shall be made as soon as administratively possible. Each non-employee director’s account balance related to compensation deferred on or after January 1, 2005 will be paid in a lump sum; however, a non-employee director may elect to receive payment of his or her account balance related to compensation deferred prior to January 1, 2005 in one to 15 annual installments. All distributions are made in the form of one share of PPG common stock for each common stock equivalent credited to the director’s deferred account (and cash as to any fractional common stock equivalents). PPG Industries Foundation Matching Gifts Program All of our current directors are eligible to participate in the PPG Industries Foundation Matching Gifts Program, which encourages charitable donations by our directors by matching their contributions to eligible institutions. Contributions of up to a total of $10,000 per year, in most cases, may be matched under the program. Most charitable organizations are eligible for the Matching Gifts Program, with a few exceptions. Stock Ownership We established stock ownership guidelines for all non-employee directors effective January 1, 2005. Under the guidelines, each non-employee director is required to own shares of our stock with a value equal to five times the portion of the annual retainer that is paid in cash. For non-employee directors, unvested TBRSUs and common stock equivalent shares credited to the director under the Deferred Compensation Plan are counted toward meeting this requirement. Mss. Ligocki and Smith and Messrs. Davis, Heminger, Nally and Novo are within their five-year compliance period and should meet the ownership requirement by the end of such period. All other non-employee directors have met or exceeded the ownership requirement. ​ ​ ​ ​ 42 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ROADMAP ​ ​ ​ HOW DID WE PERFORM?

This vision is enabled by a strategy of accelerated profitable growth and enhanced operational excellence. Our executive compensation program is a key factor in promoting this strategy and a crucial tool in aligning the interests of our senior leadership with those of our shareholders. ​ ​ ​ HOW DID WE PERFORM? In the following section, we discuss our performance in 2020 and how it affected the compensation of our named executive officers. The Company’s strong performance and focus on shareholder value is evident in our continuing legacy of outstanding cash generation and rewarding shareholders. PPG has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899 and has increased its annual dividend payout for 49 consecutive years. Continuing with that legacy, in 2020 PPG returned about $500 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. ● In 2020, the Company delivered solid financial performance despite the global COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted the Company’s 2020 performance and businesses. While some of our business units were positively impacted, our overall business suffered from significantly reduced market demand. Total net sales from continuing operations for 2020 were approximately $13.8 billion, down about 9% compared to 2019, including net unfavorable foreign currency translation of about 1%. The Company’s 2020 full-year reported net income from continuing operations was $1.1 billion, or $4.44 per diluted share versus $1.2 billion, or $5.22 per diluted share, in 2019. Full-year 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations decreased about 8% year-over-year to $5.70 compared with $6.22 in 2019. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for 2020 was $1.35 billion, versus $1.48 billion in 2019. ● In 2020, the Company generated approximately $2.3 billion in adjusted cash flow from operations, which is about $200 million higher than 2019. ● Our business portfolio demonstrated its resiliency during the pandemic with swift recovery of operating margins and record adjusted earnings per share in the second half of the year, up nearly 20 percent compared to the prior year. ● Operating working capital as a percent of sales improved 180 basis points compared to prior year. ● In September, the Company raised the per-share dividend by 6%—paying approximately $500 million in dividends in 2020. ● In 2020, the Company completed three acquisitions, increasing both geographic and product scope. Cash spending for these acquisitions totaled approximately $1.2 billion. ● Net capital expenditures totaled about $300 million, down versus the prior year reflecting the Company’s decisive actions to curtail non-essential spending during the peak of the pandemic. ● The Company’s stock price increased 8% during 2020 providing value to our shareholders. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 45 ​ Table of Contents The following charts contain adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, net sales from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations as used for determining the compensation of our executive officers for each of the last five fiscal years: ​ ​ ​ Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share from Continuing Operations Net Sales (In Millions USD) Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations (In Millions USD) ​ *2016 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share include $46 million ($0.17) for results of the flat glass business through September 30, 2016, which has been recast as discontinued operations for all periods presented but which is included in the compensation metric. **2017 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share include $15 million ($0.06) for the results of the North American fiber glass business through August 31, 2017, which has been recast as discontinued operations for all periods presented, but which is included in the compensation metric. These figures also include $20 million ($0.08) for the impact of raw materials and Puerto Rican business resulting from the 2017 natural disasters. ***2019 Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share includes $0.16 for the year-over-year impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for earnings per diluted share or net income or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. A Regulation G reconciliation of adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations to reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and net income from continuing operations is included in Annex A to this Proxy Statement. ● Although we had solid performance in 2020, we did not achieve our adjusted earnings per diluted share target or our sales volume/mix growth target. As discussed below, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee applied discretion to the calculation of our annual incentive award in recognition of the decisive actions taken to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the Company’s efforts to drive growth and improve price during the year. As a result, annual incentive awards were paid to executive officers at 100% of target. Our total shareholder return over the past three years when measured against the S&P 500 was in the 53rd percentile resulting in the payment of long-term TSR share awards at 85.5% of target. ● Between 70% and 89% of the named executive officers’ target total direct compensation opportunity for 2020 was in the form of performance-based variable compensation and long-term incentives motivating them to deliver strong business performance and create shareholder value. ● Base salary and annual incentive targets for our executive officers are established annually to maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions. Target total annual compensation for each position is set at or near the market median. ● PPG’s compensation programs are reviewed annually to identify any inherent material risks to PPG created by these programs. Based on the results of the 2020 review, we concluded that the design of our compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long-term value of PPG. ● ​ ​ ​ 46 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents ​ ​ HOW DO WE DETERMINE COMPENSATION? In the following section, we discuss our philosophy for compensating executives based on their performance as well as how we execute that philosophy through our compensation programs. ​ ​ ​ Executive compensation is based on our pay-for-performance philosophy, which emphasizes executive performance measures that correlate closely with the achievement of both shorter-term performance objectives and longer-term shareholder value creation. ​ ​ In keeping with our pay-for-performance philosophy, a substantial portion of our executives’ annual and long-term compensation is performance-based, with the payment being contingent on the achievement of performance goals. We believe the program strikes the appropriate balance between effectively incentivizing our executives based on performance and utilizing responsible, market competitive pay practices in order that our executives dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our shareholders. This balance is evidenced by the performance metrics described in the section above. Compensation Philosophy and Objectives PPG’s philosophy in establishing compensation policies for our executive officers is to align compensation with our strategic objectives, while concurrently providing competitive compensation that enables us to attract and retain top-quality executive talent. The primary objectives of our compensation policies for executive officers are to: ● Attract and retain executive officers by offering total compensation that is competitive with that offered by similarly situated companies and rewarding outstanding personal performance; ● Promote and reward the achievement of short-term objectives that our Board of Directors and management believe will lead to long-term growth in shareholder value; and ● Closely align the interests of executive officers with those of our shareholders by making long-term incentive compensation dependent upon the Company’s financial performance and total shareholder return. Annual Compensation Programs Our executive officers receive two forms of annual compensation—base salary and annual incentive awards—which together constitute an executive’s total annual compensation. Our executive officers also receive long-term incentives which together with total annual compensation constitute an executive’s total direct compensation. Please note that “total annual compensation” and “total direct compensation” as discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, differs from the “Total” compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table, which includes long-term incentive and other forms of compensation. The levels of base salary and annual incentive targets for our executive officers are established annually under a program intended to maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions. Target total annual compensation and target total direct compensation for each position is set at or near the “market value” for that position. To determine market value, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee considers compensation data based on a comparator group, as well as the most recently available data from nationally-recognized independent executive compensation surveys representing a cross section of general industrial companies. For purposes of establishing the 2020 executive compensation program, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee considered a competitive analysis of total direct compensation levels and compensation mixes for our executive officers, using information from: ● two general industry surveys in which management participates: the Aon Hewitt Associates 2019 TCM Executive Total Compensation Survey and the Willis Towers Watson 2019 U.S. General Industry Executive Database; and ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 47 ​ Table of Contents ● comparison company median data from a comparator group consisting of 18 companies. The comparator group used in 2019 to set 2020 compensation was: ​ ​ ​ ​ 3M Company Eaton Corporation plc Illinois Tool Works Inc. The Sherwin-Williams Company Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Ecolab Inc. International Paper Company Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Arconic Inc. Emerson Electric Co. Johnson Controls International plc Textron Inc. Celanese Corporation Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Linde plc ​ Eastman Chemical Company Honeywell International Inc. Parker-Hannifin Corporation ​ Our comparator group is intended to be representative of the market in which we compete most directly for executive talent. The selection of companies comprising our comparator group is based on similarity in revenue size, lines of business, participation in global markets and market capitalization. The peer group is constructed to target PPG near the median of the composite ranking of the financial and operating metrics of the companies in the comparator group. The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee annually reviews this group of companies with our independent executive compensation consultant, FW Cook, to ensure that it remains an appropriate benchmark for us. We target the median levels of compensation to derive our market value by adjusting this compensation data to reflect differences in company revenues using regression analysis. The competitive analysis showed that the 2020 target total direct compensation for the Company’s named executive officers was on average positioned within the market median range, which we define as within 20% of the median. In addition, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee annually reviews a tally sheet of each executive officer’s compensation. Each tally sheet includes detailed data for each of the following compensation elements: ● Annual compensation: Information regarding base salary and annual incentive targets for the current year; ● Long-term incentive awards: Information regarding all equity-based awards, whether vested or unvested, including total pre-tax value to the executive and holdings relative to our stock ownership requirements; ● Benefits and perquisites: Line item summary showing the annualized cost to the Company of health and welfare benefits, life insurance and perquisites; ● Pension and deferred compensation: Annualized cost to the Company of pension plan benefits (qualified plan and non-qualified plan) and defined contribution plans (401(k) and deferred compensation); and ● Description and quantification of all compensation and benefits payable upon retirement, termination of employment or change in control. The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee reviews the information presented in the tally sheet to ensure that it is informed of the compensation and benefits each executive is receiving annually. ​ ​ ​ 48 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents The charts below illustrate the allocation of the principal compensation components for our named executive officers for 2020. ​ ​ ​ CEO Target Compensation ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other Named Executive Officer Target Compensation ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ HOW DO WE ADDRESS RISK? In the following section, we outline strategies that we’ve developed to mitigate risks over the short and long term in consideration of regulatory requirements. Compensation Program Design Mitigates Risk Annually, PPG management undertakes a review of all of PPG’s compensation programs to identify any inherent material risks to PPG created by these programs. The framework used to identify any potential risks that could be incentivized by our compensation programs was developed with input from members of our human resources, finance, and legal functions and our independent executive compensation consultant, FW Cook. Based on the results of the 2020 review, we concluded that the design of our compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long-term value of PPG. Features of our compensation programs and practices that mitigate risk include, among other things: (i) incentive plans that are appropriately weighted between short-term and long-term performance and cash and equity; (ii) long-term incentives that consist of a mix of stock options, performance-based restricted stock units and total shareholder return contingent shares, which provides for a ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 49 ​ Table of Contents balanced mix of performance measures; (iii) ranges of performance and multiple performance targets are utilized to determine incentive compensation payouts, rather than a single performance target that provides an “all or nothing” basis for compensation; (iv) maximum payouts are in place in our incentive compensation programs to limit excessive payments; (v) determination of incentive compensation payouts is subject to managerial approval and/or Officers—Directors Compensation Committee discretion; and (vi) our executive officers are subject to a recoupment policy in the event of a financial restatement affecting their incentive compensation payout. In addition, the following design elements of our compensation program mitigate potential risks: ● Our officers are subject to stock ownership requirements, as discussed below. ● Our officers may not engage in transactions that are contrary to the interests of shareholders, such as “short sales,” “short sales against the box,” “put” and “call” options and hedging transactions designed to minimize an executive’s risk inherent in owning PPG stock. In addition, officers may not hold PPG stock in a margin account and may not pledge PPG stock as collateral for a loan. ● Executive officers are subject to a “clawback” policy that is designed to recoup incentive compensation when a financial restatement occurs and certain other conditions exist. ● We provide very limited perquisites to our executive officers. ● We do not provide tax gross-ups on perquisites to our named executive officers. Financial Restatement It is our policy that we will, to the extent permitted by governing law, seek recoupment of incentive compensation paid to any executive officer where: ● the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement; ● the executive officer is found to have engaged in fraud or misconduct that caused or partially caused the need for the restatement; and ● a lower payment would have been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results. In each such instance, we will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover the amount by which the individual executive officer’s incentive compensation for the relevant period exceeded the payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results, plus a reasonable rate of interest. PPG Stock Ownership Requirements The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee also believes that it is in the best interests of shareholders for our officers to own a significant amount of PPG common stock, thereby aligning their interests with the interests of shareholders. Accordingly, in 2003 the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee implemented stock ownership requirements applicable to all of our officers based on a multiple of base salary. The current stock ownership requirements are: ​ ​ ​ ​ Position ​ ​ Required Stock Ownership Chief Executive Officer 6 times base salary Other executive officers 3 times base salary Other officers 1 or 2 times base salary Ownership for purposes of these requirements includes shares of PPG common stock personally owned as well as all stock holdings in PPG’s savings plan and deferred compensation accounts. Unexercised options and unvested shares awarded under our long-term incentive plans are not counted for these purposes. Officers are expected to meet these ownership requirements within five years of election, appointment or promotion. Those officers who have not yet met this requirement are paid 20% of their annual incentive in PPG stock, which is restricted from sale for a period of two to five years. In addition, for officers who have been subject to the policy for more than five years at their current requirement level and have not met the ownership requirement, 100% of the vested shares delivered from the PBRSU award and TSR share award must be held by the officer for a minimum of one year and until the requirement is met. The executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table have met their ownership requirement, except for ​ ​ ​ 50 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Ms. Liebert who joined the Company in June 2018 and Ms. Foulkes who was promoted to Senior Vice President and General Counsel in August 2018. Ms. Liebert and Ms. Foulkes are within the five-year compliance period. Prohibition on Hedging and Pledging PPG Securities PPG officers and directors may not engage in any transaction in which they may profit from short-term speculative swings in the value of PPG’s securities. This prohibition includes “short sales” (selling borrowed securities that the seller hopes can be purchased at a lower price in the future) or “short sales against the box” (selling owned, but not delivered securities), “put” and “call” options (publicly available rights to sell or buy securities within a certain period of time at a specified price) and other hedging transactions designed to minimize an executive’s risk inherent in owning PPG stock, such as zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts. In addition, officers may not hold PPG stock in a margin account and may not pledge PPG stock as collateral for a loan. This policy is designed to discourage risk taking with PPG securities by officers and to ensure compliance with all insider trading rules. PPG employees who are not officers of the Company are not subject to these prohibitions. However, PPG’s Global Code of Ethics prohibits all PPG employees from buying or selling PPG stock or the stock of any other company while aware of material non-public information and prohibits employees from sharing material non-public information for financial or other personal benefit. Our Policies with Respect to the Granting of Equity Awards Equity awards may be granted by either the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee or its delegate. The Officers- Directors Compensation Committee only delegates authority to grant equity awards to employees who are not executive officers, and only in aggregate amounts not exceeding amounts approved by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee. The Board generally does not grant equity awards, although the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee regularly reports its activity, including approval of grants, to the Board. Timing of Grants. Equity awards are granted in February at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee, and generally further grants are not made for the remainder of the year. These meetings occur approximately one month after the release of our earnings for the immediately preceding year. On limited occasions, grants may occur on an interim basis, primarily for the purpose of approving a compensation package for a newly hired or promoted executive officer. The timing of these grants is driven solely by the activity related to the need for the hiring or promotion, not our stock price or the timing of any release of Company information. Option Exercise Price. The exercise price of a newly granted stock option is the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. With respect to the occasional interim grants to a newly hired or promoted executive, the exercise price is the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, which is the later of the approval date or the hire or promotion date; provided, however, that if the date of hire or promotion would fall within a Company imposed blackout period, the grant date will be the first business day following such blackout period. Change In Control Agreements We have agreements in place with each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table providing for their continued employment for a period of up to three years in the event of an actual or threatened change in control of PPG (as “change in control” is defined in the agreements). We believe that these agreements serve to maintain the focus of our senior executives and ensure that their attention, efforts and commitment are aligned with maximizing the success of PPG and shareholder value. These agreements avoid distractions involving executive management that arise when the Board is considering possible strategic transactions involving a change in control and assure continuity of executive management and objective input to the Board when it is considering any strategic transaction. For additional information concerning our change in control agreements, see “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control.” Regulatory Considerations The tax and accounting consequences of utilizing various forms of compensation are considered when adopting new or modifying existing compensation programs. For example, we considered limitations on the deductibility of personal use of corporate aircraft under the American Jobs Creation Act when adopting our policies regarding use of our aircraft by executive officers. In addition, we have administered our incentive and equity compensation programs, severance plans and change in control agreements in compliance with federal tax rules affecting non-qualified deferred compensation. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the deductibility of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to any one named executive officer during any fiscal year. Under the rules in effect before 2018, compensation that qualified as “performance-based” under Section 162(m) was deductible without regard to this $1 million limit. To maintain ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 51 ​ Table of Contents flexibility in compensating executives in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee did not adopt a policy requiring all compensation to be deductible under Section 162(m) and continues to reserve the right to structure compensation arrangements and issue awards that may not be deductible under Section 162(m). However, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee historically has considered, among other factors, deductibility under Section 162(m) with respect to compensation arrangements for executives. Prior to 2018, we generally designed our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs for executives in a manner that was intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), with the understanding that these programs may not qualify from time to time. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law December 22, 2017, eliminated the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m), effective January 1, 2018, subject to a special rule that “grandfathers” certain awards and arrangements that were in effect on or before November 2, 2017. As a result, compensation that our Officers-Directors Compensation Committee structured in 2017 and prior years with the intent of qualifying as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) that is paid on or after January 1, 2018 may not be fully deductible, depending on the application of the special grandfather rules. Moreover, from and after January 1, 2018, compensation awarded in excess of $1,000,000 to our named executive officers, including our chief financial officer, generally will not be deductible. While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will limit the deductibility of compensation paid to our named executive officers, our Officers-Directors Compensation Committee will, consistent with its past practice, continue to retain flexibility to design compensation programs that are in the best long-term interests of PPG and our shareholders, with deductibility of compensation being one of a variety of considerations taken into account. We continue to analyze whether to redesign any of our compensation programs in light of the amendments to Section 162(m) and other sections of the Internal Revenue Code that became effective in 2018. ​ ​ ​ ​ HOW DO WE PAY OUR EXECUTIVES? In this section, we describe the components of the total compensation package for our executives and how these components align with our greater pay-for-performance philosophy. Principal Components of Executive Compensation The principal components of our executive compensation program are: ​ ​ ​ COMPENSATION COMPONENT OVERVIEW OBJECTIVES Base Salary Fixed compensation that is established annually Maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions Annual Incentive Awards Variable compensation that is based on Company, business, and individual performance Incentivize executive officers to achieve our short-term performance objectives Long-Term, Equity-Based Incentives Variable compensation that is based solely on Company performance Retain our executive officers, align their financial interests with the interests of shareholders, and incentivize achievement of our long-term strategic goals Mix of Compensation Components Executive compensation is based on our pay-for-performance philosophy, which emphasizes executive performance measures that correlate closely with the achievement of both shorter-term performance objectives and longer-term shareholder value creation. To this end, a substantial portion of our executives’ annual and long-term compensation is performance-based, with the payment being contingent on the achievement of performance goals. The portion of compensation that is performance-based increases with the executive’s level of responsibility. We use performance- based compensation for more senior positions because these roles have greater leadership responsibility and influence on the performance of the Company as a whole. ​ ​ ​ 52 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Annual Compensation Our annual compensation policies reflect our pay-for-performance philosophy. We set target total annual compensation for our executive officers to be competitive with the market value for comparable positions, taking into account each executive’s experience in the position and performance. Annual incentive awards are targeted at a level that, when combined with base salaries, is intended to yield total annual compensation that approximates market value. As a result, total annual compensation for a position generally should exceed its market value when our financial performance exceeds our applicable annual targets and individual performance contributes to meeting our objectives. Total annual compensation generally should be below market value when our financial performance does not meet targets and/or individual performance does not have a favorable impact on our objectives. Base Salary. Based on the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee’s review of the applicable compensation data as discussed above, in February 2020 the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee set base salaries effective March 1, 2020 for all executive officers in relation to the market value for comparable positions. Mr. McGarry received a base salary increase of $35,000. Mr. Morales received a base salary increase of $80,000. Mr. Knavish and Ms. Liebert each received a base salary increase of $20,000. Ms. Foulkes received a base salary increase of $30,000. Given the global COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Company, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee approved a temporary base salary reduction for the named executive officers, which was effective April 2020 through July 2020. For Mr. McGarry, his base salary was reduced by 30% to $910,000. For Messrs. Morales and Knavish and Mss. Liebert and Foulkes, their base salaries were reduced by 25% to $532,500, $525,000, $525,000 and $405,000, respectively. The full base salaries were restated effective August 2020 as follows: Mr. McGarry, $1,300,000; Mr. Morales, $710,000; Mr. Knavish, $700,000; Ms. Liebert, $700,000; and Ms. Foulkes, $540,000. Annual Incentive Awards. In February 2020, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee established annual incentive awards primarily based on target levels set for each executive officer and pre-established, short-term performance objectives. On an annual basis, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee establishes a target annual incentive award for each executive officer based on the executive’s position and the market value of comparable positions in our comparator group. For 2020, this target, when expressed as a percentage of base salary, was as follows for each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. McGarry, 150%; Mr. Morales, 90%; Mr. Knavish, 80%; Ms. Liebert, 80%; and Ms. Foulkes, 80%. The amount of an executive’s actual annual incentive award, in relation to the executive’s target opportunity, is determined on the basis of achievement of short-term performance objectives. The performance objectives for our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Senior Vice President and General Counsel include specific financial targets for Company performance (weighted 70%) and personal performance (weighted 30%). The performance objectives for our other executive officers include specific financial targets for Company performance (weighted 20%), business performance (weighted 50%) and personal performance (weighted 30%). The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee has approved re-weighting these factors for 2021 annual incentive awards to emphasize growth and performance of PPG as a whole. For executive officers with business unit responsibility, the 2021 weighting will be Company performance (weighted 50%), business performance (weighted 30%) and personal performance (weighted 20%). For many years, PPG has been committed to sustainability. Recognizing the importance of sustainability and its ability to drive innovation in our business, PPG includes sustainability goals in the performance goals of its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Performance against these goals is reviewed by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Annual incentive compensation of PPG’s executives and senior managers is partially (30 percent) based on personal goals that tie to overall corporate business goals, with the remainder based on company and business financial performance. Depending on their role, some executives and senior managers, by virtue of their responsibilities, may have goals related to social or environmental performance. In addition, executive business unit leaders receive sustainability scorecards for their business unit, and they are responsible for driving improvement in their business unit’s sustainability metrics. Safety, waste costs, energy usage and costs, and sustainable product sales are part of these executives’ annual performance review. The potential payout of the Company performance component of the annual incentive is based on a pre-determined schedule recommended by management and approved by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee. The schedule corresponds to various levels of potential Company financial performance measured by adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (weighted 60%), adjusted cash flow from operating activities (weighted 20%) and organic sales growth (weighted 20%), assuming the minimum adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations threshold is met. The maximum payout of this component under the schedule is 220% of target. In assessing Company performance against objectives, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee considers reported results against the approved target objectives, taking into consideration whether significant uncontrollable and unforeseen events or economic obstacles or more favorable circumstances impacted the Company’s results. The ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 53 ​ Table of Contents assessment of Company performance determines the percentage of the target award that will be awarded to each executive for the Company performance component of the annual incentive award. For 2020, as described below, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee exercised discretion and approved certain non-operating adjustments to the 2020 reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, cash flow from operating activities – continuing operations results and organic sales growth, consistent with guidelines established previously by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee. In the past, select adjustments have related to items such as legacy litigation or legacy environmental remediation, accounting rule changes and major business portfolio changes, including planned restructuring initiatives. In April 2020, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee approved a financial performance target for the Company component of the annual incentive award of $6.40 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (60% weighting), adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $2,150 million (20% weighting) and organic sales growth, defined as a combination of price and volume, of 1.3% (20% weighting). If achieved, this performance would generate 97% of the target bonus for the Company component of the award. The approved performance target for 2020 included a threshold adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $4.80, below which no bonus would be paid, regardless of either the adjusted cash flow from operating activities or the organic sales growth performance, and a minimum cash flow from continuing operations performance of $1,338 million and a minimum organic sales growth performance of 0.0% for payment on those two components. In addition, the approved performance standard for 2020 included a maximum bonus opportunity of 220% if adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $7.04, adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $2,408 million and organic sales growth of 2.0% were achieved. The Company met regularly with the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee as well as with the full Board to provide an update on business conditions throughout 2020. During 2020, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee monitored the Company’s efforts to protect shareholder value, ensure employee health and safety, partner with customers, deliver and strengthened financial performance, maintain business continuity and improve employee engagement. In December 2020 and again in January 2021, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee evaluated the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s performance and the resulting impact on executive performance and compensation in light of its pay for performance principles and in alignment with shareholders’ interests, and motivation and retention of key talent. The global COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the Company’s 2020 performance and businesses. While some of our business units were positively impacted, our overall business suffered from significantly reduced market demand. The Company’s global architectural coatings businesses had strong demand in the do-it-yourself (DIY) channel and the packaging coatings business benefited from the work-from-home transition and pantry stocking. The automotive refinish coatings business remained well below prior year levels due to significantly less traffic congestion at peak driving hours.  The automotive original equipment manufacturer coatings business was impacted by numerous customer shutdowns that started in March and continued well into May. However, the most significant negatively impacted business due to the pandemic was the aerospace coatings business. The COVID-19 impact on the airline industry was far-reaching and extreme. Some of the key indicators for the aerospace industry included: (a) global available seat miles forecast for 2020 decreased from pre-COVID-19 levels of 7.1 billion to 3.8 billion (-47%) and (b) build rates for Boeing and Airbus decreased 82% and 42%, respectively, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Muted demand continues for PPG aerospace products in the commercial aftermarket and in the business overall and is expected to remain somewhat depressed for the next few years. The Company completed three acquisitions during 2020. Cash spending for these acquisitions totaled approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, the Company had record adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in both the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2020 and delivered record adjusted cash flow from operations of $2.3 billion. Adjustments to the cash flow from operating activities performance component included adding back $126 million for restructuring cash spending and $17 million for cash contributions to pension plans. The Company’s stock price achieved an all-time high in December 2020. The Company also delivered over $400 million in structural cost savings through execution of restructuring programs and for pandemic-related interim savings and cost avoidance including global salary reductions, temporary layoffs, implementing a hiring freeze and reduction of professional services costs. The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee considered global industry macroeconomic factors, management’s actions and leadership to protect and grow shareholder value, partner with customers, to protect the health, safety and well-being of the workforce and, ultimately, the Company’s performance versus plan and versus the Company’s peer group. To recognize the Company’s leadership and decisive actions taken to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, its employees and its customers as well as the Company’s efforts to drive growth and improve price during the year, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee approved the 2020 performance calculation of 100% for the named executive officers. ​ ​ ​ 54 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Approved 2020 Performance Components: The personal performance component of the annual incentive is based on measures of individual performance relevant to the particular individual’s job responsibilities. The personal performance assessment of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is determined by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee with input from the other non-management members of the Board. The personal performance of each other executive officer is determined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The following factors were considered in assessing the personal performance of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table for 2020 against individual objectives: Mr. McGarry delivered strong results by quickly and ably pivoting the Company to manage the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. He initiated programs to safeguard the health and safety of PPG’s workforce, to increase communications from key leaders and to protect the Company from the downturn in demand for many our products. Mr. McGarry was able to balance these efforts with targeted capital spending to sustain organic and inorganic growth initiatives. Under Mr. McGarry’s leadership, the Company delivered solid operational and financial performance despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted the Company’s 2020 performance and businesses. Total net sales from continuing operations for 2020 were approximately $13.8 billion, down about 9% compared to 2019, including net unfavorable foreign currency translation of about 1%. The Company’s 2020 full-year reported net income from continuing operations was $1.1 billion, or $4.44 per diluted share versus $1.2 billion, or $5.22 per diluted share, in 2019. Full-year 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations decreased about 8% year-over-year to $5.70 compared with $6.22 in 2019. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for 2020 was $1.35 billion, versus $1.48 billion in 2019. Most notably, third quarter and fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings were record results and have positioned the company for continued success in 2021. Mr. McGarry led the expansion of our coatings portfolio with the completion of three acquisitions and the signing of three others. He also was successful in leading the Company’s efforts to increase prices, to recover margins and to implement productivity initiatives that resulted in nearly $115 million in lower costs. The Company continued to make significant strides in its sustainability performance with serious injuries down 28%, spills and releases down nearly 3%, and energy intensity down nearly 10%. The Company strengthened its focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) in 2020 and received a score of 90% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index. Finally, engagement scores in the company improved by 9%. Mr. Morales led the finance organization to deliver very effective results. In 2020, the Company generated record cash from adjusted operations of $2.3 billion, which was an increase about $200 million compared to 2019. Mr. Morales led the Company’s efforts to increase cash on hand to protect the Company at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, lower working capital, manage capital spending, contain costs and return capital to our shareholders. In addition, he provided guidance over the diligence, signing and completion of several acquisitions. He also continued to lead efforts to streamline the finance function by centralizing operations, implementing new tools and processes. Mr. Morales performed effectively as a member of the Executive Committee, positively influencing the results of the Company. Mr. Knavish led the architectural coatings business for the United States/Canada (“USCA”), Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific regions.  He also oversaw the automotive refinish coatings business and the Latin America region. Under Mr. Knavish’s leadership, architectural coatings EMEA organic sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage driven by strong volumes in the second half of the year offset by lower demand in Southern Europe earlier in the year when various countries mandated the closure of retail paint stores. Architectural coatings USCA and architectural coatings Asia Pacific sales increased a low-single-digit percentage during the year with differences by channel and region. Higher do-it yourself sales volumes were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of retail store shutdowns in the U.S. and Canada. Net sales for automotive refinish coatings were down about 15% versus prior year consistent with the sharp decline in global miles driven and traffic density in most of the world due to mobility restrictions and stay-at-home mandates as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, he led the initiative to make hand sanitizer for The Home Depot and other PPG customers. In addition, he provided guidance over the signing and completion of several acquisitions. Mr. Knavish provided leadership to his staff responsibilities for the digital function and information technology organization. Mr. Knavish performed effectively as a member of the Executive Committee, positively influencing the results of the Company. Ms. Liebert led the automotive original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) business, the industrial coatings business and the Asia Pacific region. Under Ms. Liebert’s leadership, automotive OEM coatings sales volumes decreased by approximately 15% year-over-year, driven by the significant curtailment in global automotive industry production rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including near total shutdowns in April and May in North America. Although sales volumes decreased year-over-year, strong sales volumes in China and the company’s strong technology and service capabilities led PPG to outpace the global industry build rate. For the industrial coatings business, net sales decreased by about 10% compared to prior year, but the team delivered record financial performance. Acquisition-related sales ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 55 ​ Table of Contents from Whitford were more than offset by lower demand stemming from reduced industrial production in most regions due to customer shutdowns. Ms. Liebert led PPG’s technical service efforts to help PPG’s automotive OEM customers quickly and successfully restart their operations after production was shut down early in 2020. She provided leadership to her staff responsibilities for our mobility initiatives and the global procurement organization, which was successful in obtaining personal protective equipment for our employees and in managing global raw material supply during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, she provided guidance over the signing and completion of several acquisitions. Ms. Liebert performed effectively as a member of the Executive Committee, positively influencing the results of the Company. Ms. Foulkes led the legal organization and was instrumental in successfully completing a number of acquisitions during the year. She was successful in navigating the unique legal challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, Ms. Foulkes was critical in defending certain of the company’s officers and directors in shareholder derivative lawsuits which were ultimately dismissed. Engagement scores for the law department were the highest in the Company. Ms. Foulkes also led efforts to lower legal costs during the year. Ms. Foulkes performed effectively as a member of the Executive Committee, positively influencing the results of the Company. Business unit short-term performance objectives and their assessment are specific to each particular business and are based on pre-tax, pre-interest earnings/return on sales, working capital reduction, and organic capital spending. The overall assessment of business performance determines the percent of target paid to applicable executives for the business component of the annual incentive award. For 2020, we assessed the performance of 10 defined businesses against the criteria discussed above. Actual payouts of the business performance component ranged from 20% to 190% of target. The business performance component payouts for two of our executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table, Mr. Knavish and Ms. Liebert, are based on the performance of each of the specific businesses and regions for which each of them is responsible. Mr. Knavish’s business performance component was a composite of the results of the architectural coatings business for the USCA, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions; the automotive refinish coatings business and the Latin America region. The composite performance of these businesses exceeded the performance objectives for pre-tax, pre-interest earnings/return on sales, working capital reductions and organic capital spending and resulted in achieving 130% of target for this component. However, for 2020, the maximum payment for this component is 100%. Ms. Liebert’s business performance component was a composite of the results of the automotive OEM business, the industrial coatings business and the Asia Pacific region. The composite performance of these businesses exceeded the performance objectives for pre-tax, pre-interest earnings/return on sales, working capital reductions and organic capital spending and resulted in achieving 130% of target for this component. However, for 2020, the maximum payment for this component is 100%. The level of achievement of corporate and personal performance objectives for 2020 for Messrs. McGarry and Morales and Ms. Foulkes corresponded to payouts of 100% of target. The level of achievement of business, corporate and personal performance objectives for 2020 for Mr. Knavish and Ms. Liebert corresponded to payouts of 100% of target, respectively. The annual incentive awards actually paid to each of these executives for 2020 are shown in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table. Annual incentive awards for these executive officers have ranged from 37% to 106% of target. Annual incentive awards are payable in cash, except that any executive who does not meet the stock ownership requirements described under “PPG Stock Ownership Requirements” receives 20% of his or her annual incentive award in the form of PPG common stock. Such stock is restricted from sale by such executive for a period of between two and five years, depending upon the level of stock ownership of the executive. In addition, for officers who have been subject to the policy for more than five years at their current requirement level and have not met the ownership requirement, 100% of the vested shares delivered from the PBRSU award and TSR share award must be held by the officer for a minimum of one year and until the requirement is met. U.S.-based participants are entitled to defer part or all of an annual incentive award under our deferred compensation plan. The executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table have met their stock ownership requirement, except for Ms. Liebert who joined the Company in June 2018 and Ms. Foulkes who was promoted to Senior Vice President and General Counsel in August 2018. Ms. Liebert and Ms. Foulkes are within the five-year compliance period. For additional information concerning our deferred compensation plan, see “Deferred Compensation Opportunities.” ​ ​ ​ 56 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Long-Term Incentive Compensation Our Officers-Directors Compensation Committee believes that long-term incentive compensation is an important component of our program because it has the effect of retaining executives, aligning executives’ financial interests with the interests of shareholders and incentivizing achievement of PPG’s long-term strategic goals. Payment of long-term incentive awards is based solely on Company performance. Grants are targeted at levels that approximate market value for comparable positions, utilizing the same compensation data used for setting total annual compensation. Each February, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee reviews and approves equity-based compensation for that year to be granted to executive officers. Three types of long-term incentive awards are granted annually to executive officers: ● Stock options; ● Total Shareholder Return contingent shares, or TSR shares; and ● Performance-based Restricted Stock Units, or PBRSUs. The number of stock options, TSR shares and PBRSUs granted to executive officers is intended to represent an estimated potential value that, when combined with total annual compensation, as discussed above, will approximate the market value of total annual and long-term compensation paid to executives in our comparator group and in a cross-section of general industrial companies represented in nationally-recognized executive compensation surveys. These types of long-term incentive awards were selected to provide a program that focuses on different aspects of long-term performance: stock price appreciation, total return to shareholders and earnings per share growth and cash flow return on capital. The estimated potential value of the awards granted to each executive officer is delivered equally through each instrument, so that approximately one-third of the value of the total award is in stock options, one-third is in performance-based RSUs, and one-third is in TSR shares. The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee selected equal distribution to emphasize its view that each of the three equity-based vehicles serves a particular purpose and is equally important in supporting our long-term compensation strategy. Stock Options. Stock options provide our executive officers with the opportunity to purchase and maintain an equity interest in PPG and to share in the appreciation of the value of our stock. All stock options granted to executive officers in 2020 were granted from our shareholder-approved Omnibus Incentive Plan. Some features of our stock option program include: ● Options become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant; ● The term of each grant does not exceed ten years; ● The exercise price is equal to the closing market price on the date of grant (we do not backdate or grant discounted stock options); ● We do not grant options with “reload” or “restored” provisions; and ● Repricing of stock options is prohibited. We continue to use stock options as a long-term incentive because stock options focus the management team on delivering levels of company financial performance over a longer term that contribute to shareholder value. For additional information concerning the timing of grants of stock options, see “Our Policies with Respect to the Granting of Equity Awards.” In February 2020, the following stock options were awarded to each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. McGarry, 125,386; Mr. Morales, 30,397; Mr. Knavish, 21,278; Ms. Liebert, 21,278; and Ms. Foulkes, 12,159. Such awards are consistent with our program to distribute long-term incentive awards equally among three different equity-based vehicles, as discussed above. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 57 ​ Table of Contents TSR Shares. TSR shares represent a contingent share grant that is made at the beginning of a three-calendar-year performance period and vests on the last day of the performance period. The grant is settled in a combination of cash and shares of PPG common stock at the end of the performance period. The award amount generated by the grant is based on PPG’s total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 comparison group. This comparison group represents the entire S&P 500 Index as it existed at the beginning of the performance period, excluding any companies that have been removed from the Index because they ceased to be publicly traded during the performance period. The calculation of total shareholder return assumes that all dividends were reinvested. Summarized below are the material provisions of the TSR share program: ​ ​ ​ BASIS OF PAYOUT PERFORMANCE PERIOD VESTING AND PAYOUT OF BENEFIT • Total shareholder return of PPG compared to total shareholder return for S&P 500 companies (as described above) ​ • Payout is 0% to 220% of original TSR shares awarded: 3 calendar years • Vest on last day of performance period ​ • Settled in a combination of cash and shares at end of performance period ​ • Dividend equivalents are awarded at the end of the performance period, based on the actual number of shares earned and paid ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ PPG TSR GRANT PAYOUT 90 th percentile 220 % 80 th percentile 180 % 70 th percentile 140 % 60 th percentile 100 % 50 th percentile 80 % 40 th percentile 50 % 30 th percentile 30 % Below — % If minimum performance is not achieved, no payment is made with respect to the TSR share grant. If performance is above target, payment may exceed the original number of contingent TSR shares awarded. Target performance is set at the 60th percentile rank. The minimum and maximum number of shares that may be issued upon settlement of a TSR share grant ranges from 0% to 220% of the original number of contingent TSR shares awarded. Dividend equivalents are awarded at the end of the performance period, based on the actual number of shares earned and paid to an executive. TSR shares are intended to reward executives only when we provide a greater long-term return to shareholders relative to a percentage of the comparison set of companies, which is consistent with our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. In February 2020, the following TSR shares were awarded to each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. McGarry, 23,009; Mr. Morales, 5,578; Mr. Knavish, 3,905; Ms. Liebert, 3,905 and Ms. Foulkes, 2,231. Such awards are consistent with our program to distribute long-term incentive awards equally among three different equity-based vehicles, as discussed above under “Long-Term Incentive Compensation.” The performance period for the TSR shares granted in 2018 ended on December 31, 2020. PPG’s total shareholder return was measured against that of the S&P 500 (as described above) over the three-year period ending December 31, 2020. PPG’s ranking on this performance measure was at the 53rd percentile, resulting in payouts at 85.5% of target. The payouts were distributed 50% in shares of PPG common stock and 50% in cash. The cash payment was calculated based on the average PPG stock closing price during the month of December 2020. Payouts to the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table for the 2018 TSR grants were: Mr. McGarry, 9,801 shares and $1,417,421; Mr. Morales, 1,593 shares and $230,380; Mr. Knavish, 1,103 shares and $159,516; Ms. Liebert, 1,357 shares and $196,249; and Ms. Foulkes, 295 shares and $42,663. Such share payouts, which vested in December 2020, are reflected in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table. Changes to the TSR Share Awards During 2019, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee undertook a review of our long-term incentive compensation program and reviewed benchmark analyses of the long-term incentive programs of similar companies. Based on this review, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee, at its February 19, 2020, meeting approved ​ ​ ​ 58 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents modifying the TSR share performance scale. Beginning with 2020 awards, TSR share grants will be paid in accordance with the following scale: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ PPG TSR GRANT PAYOUT 90 th percentile 200 % 80 th percentile 175 % 70 th percentile 150 % 60 th percentile 125 % 50 th percentile 100 % 40 th percentile 75 % 30 th percentile 50 % Below — % Performance-based RSUs. Performance-based RSUs, or PBRSUs, represent a contingent share grant that is made at the beginning of a three-calendar-year performance period and vests on the last day of the performance period. If we achieve certain pre-determined performance thresholds, payment is settled in shares of PPG common stock in the February immediately after the end of the three-year performance period. The performance criteria for each year in the three-year performance period were 10% growth in adjusted earnings per diluted share and 12% cash flow return on capital for 2018 and 10% growth in adjusted earnings per diluted share and 11% cash flow return on capital for 2019 and 2020, taking into account the same adjustment categories utilized by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee in determining adjusted earnings per diluted share for purposes of annual incentive awards (see “Annual Incentive Awards” above). If minimum performance is not achieved, no shares are issued with respect to the grant. If performance is above target, the number of shares issued may exceed the original number of contingent shares awarded. The minimum and maximum number of shares that may be issued upon settlement of an PBRSU ranges from 0% to 180% of the original number of contingent shares awarded, depending on the number of goals attained during the three-year period (see the table below for a breakdown of the payout percentages). No dividend equivalents are awarded on performance-based RSUs. By including performance-based RSUs in the long-term incentive mix, executives are rewarded when financial performance objectives are achieved over an extended period of time. Summarized below are the material provisions of the performance-based RSUs: ​ ​ ​ BASIS OF PAYOUT PERFORMANCE PERIOD VESTING AND PAYOUT OF BENEFIT Performance Goals: ​ • 10% growth in adjusted earnings per diluted share ​ • 12% cash flow return on capital (2018) ​ • 11% cash flow return on capital (2019 and 2020) ​ Payout is 0% to 180% of original PBRSU shares awarded: 3 calendar years • Vest on last day of performance period ​ • Settled in shares in the February immediately after the end of performance period ​ • No dividend equivalents are awarded ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ GOALS ATTAINED IN PERFORMANCE PERIOD PAYOUT 6 goals 180 % 4 or 5 goals in 3 years 150 % 4 goals in 2 years 100 % 3 goals 100 % 2 goals 50 % 1 goal 25 % 0 goals — % In February 2020, the following PBRSUs were awarded to each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. McGarry, 24,351; Mr. Morales, 5,903; Mr. Knavish, 4,132; Ms. Liebert, 4,132; and Ms. Foulkes, 2,361. Such awards are consistent with our program to distribute long-term incentive awards equally among three different equity-based vehicles, as discussed above under “Long-Term Incentive Compensation.” The performance period for the PBRSUs granted in 2018 ended on December 31, 2020. For the 2018 grants, three of the annual goals were achieved in three years, yielding payouts at 100% of target. Specifically, the results were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 59 ​ Table of Contents PBRSU Performance Measures for 2018-2020 Performance Period ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2018 ​ 2019 ​ 2020 ​ 2018 - 2020 ​ ​ EPS ​ CASH FLOW ​ EPS ​ CASH FLOW ​ EPS ​ CASH FLOW ​ TOTAL GOALS ​ ​ GROWTH ​ ROC ​ GROWTH ​ ROC ​ GROWTH ​ ROC ​ MET Goal Result 1.0 % 12.0 % 7.8 % 17.4 % (8.4) % 17.8 % Goals Met — 1 — 1 — 1 3 ​ The Company made share payouts to the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table for the 2018 PBRSU grants as follows: Mr. McGarry, 24,205; Mr. Morales, 3,933; Mr. Knavish, 2,723; Ms. Liebert, 3,172; and Ms. Foulkes, 690. Such payouts, which vested in December 2020, are reflected in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table. Changes to the Performance-based RSU Awards The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee’s 2019 review of PPG’s long-term incentive compensation program noted above showed that PPG’s PBRSU awards are somewhat uniquely designed and that a larger portion of our RSUs are performance based than the peer group. Recognizing this, at its February 19, 2020, meeting the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee also approved modifying the methodology used to calculate the payout of the PBRSUs. With respect to the earnings per share goal, instead of using discrete goals that are or are not met based on achieving 10% earnings per share growth, beginning with 2020 awards the earnings per diluted share growth portion of the PBRSU awards will utilize a linear payment scale that will be calculated annually as shown below: EPS GROWTH (ANNUAL ) ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL PAYOUT FACTOR < 5.0% 0.0% 5.0% 50.0% 6.0% 60.0% 7.0% 70.0% 8.0% 80.0% 9.0% 90.0% >= 10.0% 100.0% Achievement of 10% growth in adjusted earnings per diluted share will still be required to receive 100% of the original share grant. A payout scale will not be applied to the cash flow return on capital goal, which will still require achievement of 11% for this goal to be met each year. Performance against the adjusted earnings per diluted share goal and the cash flow return on capital goal will be calculated annually, and the annual payout for each goal will be weighted equally over the three-year period. The table below provides a hypothetical example of how PBRSU awards will be calculated using the new payout scales: ​ ​ RESULT PAYOUT FACTOR PORTION OF PERFORMANCE CYCLE PAYOUT % ACHIEVED EPS Growth 2020 9.2% 92.0% 1/3 30.6% 2021 10.0% 100.0% 1/3 33.3% 2022 11.0% 100.0% 1/3 33.3% ​ ​ ​ ​ 97.2% Cash Flow ROC 2020 13.0% 100.0% 1/3 33.3% 2021 18.0% 100.0% 1/3 33.3% 2022 10.0% 0.0% 1/3 0.0% ​ ​ ​ ​ 66.6% Total PBRSU payout (EPS Growth plus Cash Flow ROC) 163.8% ​ ​ Under this revised methodology, the maximum PBRSU payout will be 200% of the original share grant if the highest level for all six goals are met in the three-year performance period. ​ ​ ​ 60 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Perquisites and Other Benefits In addition to the annual and long-term compensation described above, executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table receive certain perquisites and other benefits. Such perquisites may include financial counseling services and limited personal use of PPG’s corporate aircraft. At the direction of the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee, in 2011 executive officer perquisites were reviewed and reduced. Effective January 1, 2012, personal club memberships were discontinued. Other benefits for our executive officers may include Company matching contributions under our Deferred Compensation Plan. These perquisites and other benefits are provided to increase the availability of the executives to focus on the business of the enterprise or because we believe they are important to our ability to attract and retain top-quality executive talent. The costs to PPG associated with providing these benefits for executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table are reflected in the “All Other Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table and in the All Other Compensation Table. We also provide other benefits, such as medical, dental and life insurance and disability coverage, to each executive named in the Summary Compensation Table under our benefit plans, which are also provided to most eligible U.S.-based salaried employees. In addition, all of our U.S.-based executive officers are eligible to participate in the PPG Industries Foundation Matching Gift Program, which encourages charitable donations by all of our U.S. employees by matching his or her contributions to eligible institutions. Contributions of up to a total of $10,000 per year, in most cases, may be matched under the program. Most charitable organizations are eligible for the Matching Gifts Program, with a few exceptions. The value of these benefits is not included in the Summary Compensation Table because such benefits are made available on a Company-wide basis to most U.S. salaried employees. We also provide vacation and other paid holidays to all employees, including the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table, which are comparable to those provided at other large companies. Deferred Compensation Opportunities and Retirement Plans Another aspect of our executive compensation program is our Deferred Compensation Plan. The plan is a voluntary, non-tax qualified, unfunded, deferred compensation plan available to all U.S.-based executive officers and other participants in our management incentive plans to enable them to save for retirement by deferring a portion of their current compensation. The plan also provides eligible employees with supplemental contributions equal to the contributions they would have received under our Employee Savings Plan, but for certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, compensation may be deferred until death, disability, retirement or termination or, in the case of the cash portion of certain incentive awards, other earlier specified dates the participants may select. Deferred amounts (other than the PPG common stock portion of deferred incentive awards, which must be invested in PPG stock) are credited to an investment account that earns a return based on the investment options chosen by the participant. The value of a participant’s investment account is based on the value of the investments selected. Benefits are paid out of our general assets. For certain longer-serving, U.S.-based, salaried employees, we maintain both a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Substantially all employees in the U.S., including our executive officers, participate in the PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan. For additional information concerning our Deferred Compensation Plan, pension plans and the PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan, see “Pension Benefits” and “PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan” and the accompanying Pension Benefits Table and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table. ​ ​ ​ ​ WHY YOU SHOULD APPROVE OUR SAY-ON-PAY? ​ ​ The Board believes that PPG’s executive compensation program aligns the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders. Our executive compensation is based on our pay for performance philosophy, which emphasizes executive performance measures that correlate closely with the achievement of both shorter term performance objectives and longer term shareholder value creation. At the 2020 annual meeting, we held a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a say-on-pay vote. Our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 95% of shareholder votes cast in favor of our 2020 say-on-pay resolution. Following its review of this vote, the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee recommended to the full Board that we retain our general approach to executive ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 61 ​ Table of Contents compensation, with an emphasis on short- and long-term incentive compensation that rewards our executive officers when they deliver value for our shareholders. Consistent with this philosophy: ● Our performance metrics are focused on increasing shareholder value and are tied to measures impacting both shorter-term and longer-term performance. Shorter-term performance metrics include adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, cash flow from operating activities-continuing operations, pre-tax, pre-interest income, working capital reduction, and sales volume/mix growth. Longer-term performance metrics include total shareholder return, adjusted earnings per diluted share growth, adjusted cash flow return on capital and stock price appreciation. ● Payment of long-term incentive awards is based solely on Company performance. We have three-year award and payout cycles for both performance-based restricted stock units and total shareholder return shares. We also have three-year vesting for stock options. ● Between 70% and 89% of the named executive officers’ target total direct compensation opportunity for 2020 was in the form of performance-based variable compensation and long term incentives motivating them to deliver strong business performance and create shareholder value. ● While our financial performance was strong, we did not achieve our adjusted earnings per diluted share or sales volume/mix growth targets. ● Executive stock ownership goals align the interests of executives with shareholders. ● We provide very limited perquisites to our executive officers. ● Our officers may not engage in transactions that are contrary to the interests of shareholders, such as “short sales,” “short sales against the box,” “put” and “call” options and hedging transactions designed to minimize an executive’s risk inherent in owning PPG stock. In addition, officers may not hold PPG stock in a margin account and may not pledge PPG stock as collateral for a loan. ● Executive officers are subject to a “clawback” policy that is designed to recoup incentive compensation when a financial restatement occurs and certain other conditions exist. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 62 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Summary Compensation Table (2018-2020) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ CHANGE ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ IN PENSION ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ VALUE AND ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NONQUALIFIED ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NON-EQUITY ​ DEFERRED ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ STOCK ​ OPTION ​ INCENTIVE PLAN ​ COMPENSATION ​ ALL OTHER ​ ​ ​ NAME AND POSITION ​ YEAR ​ SALARY (3) ​ BONUS (4) ​ AWARDS (5) ​ AWARDS (6) ​ COMPENSATION (7) ​ EARNINGS (8) ​ COMPENSATION (9) ​ TOTAL M. H. McGarry 2020 ​ $ 1,164,167 ​ $ — ​ $ 5,499,994 ​ $ 2,749,715 ​ $ 1,950,000 ​ $ 4,289,632 ​ $ 250,485 ​ $ 15,903,993 Chairman and Chief 2019 ​ $ 1,265,000 ​ $ — ​ $ 5,333,357 ​ $ 2,666,565 ​ $ 1,850,000 ​ $ 3,827,671 ​ $ 175,345 ​ $ 15,117,938 Executive Officer 2018 ​ $ 1,258,333 ​ $ — ​ $ 5,334,995 ​ $ 2,666,347 ​ $ 1,160,000 ​ $ 1,223,849 ​ $ 140,880 ​ $ 11,784,404 V.

Each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table participates in these plans, with the exception of Ms. Liebert. The executives named below ceased to accrue benefits under Retirement Plan C on December 31, 2020. The table below shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to each such named executive officer as of December 31, 2020, including the number of years of service credited to each such named executive officer, under each of Retirement Plan C and the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan, determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in our financial statements. The material terms of Retirement Plan C and the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan are described below.

As further described in the narrative discussion following this table, the estimated lump-sum present value under the Non-Qualified Pension Plan to which the officer would be entitled is as follows: Mr. McGarry, $28,586,563; and Ms. Foulkes, $3,421,907. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 67 ​ Table of Contents The values reflected in the “Present Value of Accumulated Benefit” column of the Pension Benefits Table are equal to the actuarial present value of each officer’s accrued benefit under the applicable plan as of December 31, 2020, using the same actuarial factors and assumptions used for financial statement reporting purposes, except that retirement age is assumed to be normal retirement age as defined in the applicable plan. These assumptions are described under Note 14 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is located on pages 58 through 64 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In accordance with Item 402(h) of Regulation S-K, the present value amounts are calculated using a 2.52% discount rate for Retirement Plan C and 2.38% discount rate for the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan. The lump-sum payment amounts for the Non-Qualified Pension Plan are calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Non-Qualified Pension Plan using the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation discount rate of 0.00% as in effect on December 31, 2020, rather than the 2.38% discount rate used for financial statement reporting purposes. The benefit payable under Retirement Plan C is a function of the participant’s five-year average annual covered base compensation for the highest five consecutive years out of the final ten years immediately prior to retirement and credited years of service. In January 2011, Retirement Plan C was amended such that eligible employees with combined age and service points fewer than 60 and actively employed by the Company as of December 31, 2011 ceased to accrue benefits under Retirement Plan C as of December 31, 2011. Eligible employees with combined age and service points of 60 or more and actively employed by the Company at December 31, 2011 ceased to accrue benefits under Retirement Plan C upon the earlier of their retirement date or December 31, 2020. Eligible employees now earn retirement benefits through the PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan. The Non-Qualified Retirement Plan’s benefit is supplemental to the qualified plan’s benefit in that the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan provides a benefit that is substantially equal to the difference between the amount that would have been payable under the qualified Retirement Plan C, in the absence of legislation limiting the compensation covered by the plan, and the amount actually payable under Retirement Plan C. The Non-Qualified Retirement Plan also includes a benefit based on bonus awards for certain U.S. management bonus program participants. The benefit payable under the Non-Qualified Plan is determined in the same manner as for Retirement Plan C with regard to credited service and base salary above legislative limits; incentive payments are factored in by using the average of the highest five payments during the last ten years prior to retirement. Retirement Plan C contains the following material terms: ● The normal form of benefit is a life annuity for unmarried participants and a joint and 50% survivor annuity for married participants; ● A participant may elect out of the normal form of benefit and receive an actuarially-equivalent alternative form of benefit, including a single life annuity (for a married participant) or a joint and survivor annuity with a survivor benefit ranging from 1%-100%, as selected by the participant; ● There is no lump-sum benefit option; ● A participant may elect early retirement up to ten years prior to the participant’s normal retirement age, subject to reduction of the retirement benefit to reflect the early commencement of the benefit; and ● A participant has a fully vested benefit under the plan upon completing five years of service or reaching early retirement age. The Non-Qualified Plan contains the following material terms: ● A participant is entitled to a distribution upon reaching the later of his or her early retirement date (as defined in the qualified plan) or the participant’s termination of employment; ● The normal form of payment for benefits at retirement for the group of participants that includes each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table who participates in the plan is a lump-sum payment; and ● A participant has a fully vested benefit under the plan upon completing five years of service or reaching early retirement age, but his or her accrued benefit is subject to forfeiture if the participant engages in any competitive activity, or other activity that is deemed contrary or harmful to the interests of PPG. PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan The PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan covers substantially all employees in the U.S. All of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table participate in the Savings Plan. The Company makes matching contributions to the Savings Plan, at management’s discretion, based upon participants’ savings, subject to certain limitations. For most participants not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, Company-matching contributions are established each year at the discretion of the Company and are applied to participant savings up to a maximum of ​ ​ ​ 68 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents 6% of eligible participant compensation. Employees can contribute from 1% to 50% of eligible plan compensation to the Savings Plan, subject to certain Plan or legal limits that may apply. Employees are always 100% vested in any money employees contribute or the Company contributes to the Savings Plan as a matching contribution. Executive officers and certain other employees also receive additional Company contributions to the Employee Savings Plan. These contributions are between 2% and 5% of a participant’s eligible plan compensation, based on age and years of service. If contributions made for the benefit of an executive are limited due to requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, we credit such excess contributions to the executive officer’s account in the Deferred Compensation Plan. These contributions vest upon completion of three years of service with the Company. In the U.S., we maintain the Deferred Compensation Plan to allow participants, including each of the U.S.-based executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table, to defer a portion of their compensation in a phantom PPG stock account or other phantom investment accounts. The amount deferred earns a return based on the investment options selected by the executive officer. Executive officers may elect to defer up to 50% of their base salary, and up to 100% of any incentive award, TSR share award and restricted stock unit award that the executive officer may be entitled to receive. All dividend equivalents earned on TSR share award grants are deferred into the Deferred Compensation Plan. We also may make certain additional contributions to the executive officer’s account. For example, if the executive officer’s contributions under the Employee Savings Plan are limited due to requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, we will credit such excess contributions to the executive officer’s account under the Deferred Compensation Plan. The executive officer is always fully vested in compensation that he or she elects to have deferred into the plan and any contributions made on behalf of the executive officer related to the Employee Savings Plan. Company contributions are invested proportionally into the investment options chosen by the employee. The table below shows the Deferred Compensation Plan’s current investment options and their respective annual rate of return for the year ended December 31, 2020, as reported by the administrator of the plan. ​ ​ ​ ​ INVESTMENT OPTION RATE OF RETURN PPG Stock Account 10.07 % Fidelity Growth Company Fund 67.51 % Fidelity Contrafund 32.50 % Fidelity US Equity Index Fund 18.40 % Fidelity Intermediate Bond Fund 7.21 % Fidelity Government Money Market 0.32 % The amount owed to executive officers under the Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded and unsecured general obligation of PPG. An executive officer receives a distribution of the balance in his or her plan account upon retirement, death, disability, termination of employment, a scheduled payment date, financial hardship (for amounts deferred prior to January 1, 2005) or unforeseeable emergency (for amounts deferred after December 31, 2004). Distributions can be in the form of a lump sum or installments. Payment can commence at the time of separation or, in certain situations, can be deferred until a later point in time. Compensation deferred prior to January 1, 2005 and related earnings are distributed according to the executive officer’s election. Compensation deferred after December 31, 2004 and related earnings are distributed according to the executive officer’s election only in the case of retirement (no earlier than six months following retirement). In the case of disability or termination, the distribution is made in a lump sum on the date that is the later of (i) the first day of the first quarter of a plan year that is six months and ten days following the separation or (ii) January 1 of the year following the separation. In the case of death, a distribution is made to the executive officer’s beneficiary as soon as administratively possible. Distributions from the PPG stock account are in the form of PPG common stock and distributions from all other investment options are in cash.

Compensatory Arrangements with Certain Executive Officers Rebecca B. Liebert. Rebecca Liebert currently serves as Executive Vice President of PPG. Upon her joining PPG as Senior Vice President, Automotive Coatings in June 2018, Ms. Liebert and PPG agreed to the following compensatory arrangement: ● A signing bonus of $1,200,000 and cash bonus of $140,000 paid in February 2019, both of which are subject to repayment should Ms. Liebert resign within two years of the payment of either of these bonuses. ● A starting base salary of $625,000 per year. ● A prorated, target bonus percentage for 2018 of 70% of Ms. Liebert’s salary. ● A grant in June 2018 of stock options, performance-based RSUs and TSR shares with an aggregate value of $1,000,000 on the grant date pursuant to PPG’s Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The RSUs and TSRs shares vest in February 2021 and the stock options vest on June 25, 2021. ● A grant in February 2019 of stock options, performance-based RSUs and TSR shares with an aggregate value of $1,000,000 on the grant date pursuant to the Plan. ● A one-time grant of time-based RSUs with an aggregate value of $3,145,000 on June 25, 2018 pursuant to the Plan with a vesting schedule of:  $1,075,000 on December 31, 2019, $1,500,000 on December 31, 2020, $420,000 on December 31, 2022, and $150,000 on December 31, 2023. ● In the event that Ms. Liebert is not selected by the Board of Directors as the next Chief Executive Officer of the Company as part of the Board of Directors’ normal succession planning process and decides to resign as a result, she will be entitled to a severance payment equal to two times her annual base salary under the following conditions: ● she remains employed and performs at a successful or above level for the 12 month period following the effective date of the appointment; ● her resignation is effective immediately following the expiration of the 12 month period; and ● she signs PPG’s standard separation agreement. ​ ​ ​ ​ 70 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL The tables below reflect the amount of compensation to each of our currently serving executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in the event of termination of such executive’s employment under certain circumstances. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2020, and thus includes amounts earned through such time and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to the executives upon their termination. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such executive’s separation from PPG. For purposes of calculating the estimated potential payments to our officers under the Non-Qualified Pension Plan, as reflected in the tables below, we have used the same actuarial factors and assumptions used for financial statement reporting purposes and set forth under Note 14 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is located on pages 58 through 64 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the amounts reflected in the tables below for the Non-Qualified Pension Plan are calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Non-Qualified Pension Plan using the 2.38% discount rate for our U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plan that is used for financial statement reporting purposes. Potential Payments and Benefits Upon Termination The first column of each table below sets forth the payments to which the officer would be entitled, other than accrued but unpaid base salary and any benefits payable or provided under broad-based employee benefit plans and programs, in the event of a termination of the officer’s employment for any reason by PPG or the officer, and assuming such termination occurred prior to, or did not otherwise arise in connection with, a change in control of PPG. The second column of each table reflects payments that would be due in the event of the officer’s termination of employment due to death prior to a change in control of PPG. In any of these events, we are not obligated to provide other health or welfare benefits or any special severance payments, accelerated vesting of equity compensation or tax gross-ups to the officers. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are not eligible to participate in the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan. Ms. Liebert is not included in the table below because she does not participate in the Non- Qualified Retirement Plan and as of December 31, 2020 she did not receive financial counseling.

Potential Payments and Benefits Upon Termination Following, or in Connection with, a Change in Control of PPG We have entered into change in control agreements with our executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table and with certain other officers. The change in control agreements have three-year terms, which terms are automatically extended for one year upon each anniversary unless a notice not to extend is given by PPG. If a “change in control” occurs during the term of an agreement, then the agreement becomes operative for a fixed three-year period. The agreements provide generally that the officer’s terms and conditions of employment (including position, location, compensation and benefits) will not be adversely changed during the three-year period after a change in control of PPG. The change in control agreements also contain non-competition provisions and confidentiality provisions prohibiting the officer from divulging or communicating, without our prior consent or except as required by law, any confidential information, knowledge or data relating to PPG or its business during the officer’s employment and at all times thereafter. The Officers—Directors Compensation Committee approved certain changes to our change in control agreements, which are described under “Changes to Form of Change in Control Agreement.” Termination For Cause or Other Than For Good Reason. Under the change in control agreements, in the event of an officer’s termination of employment by PPG for cause or by the officer other than for good reason during the three-year period following a change in control, the officer will receive payment only of his or her accrued but unpaid base salary and any benefits payable or provided under broad-based employee benefit plans and programs. Termination Without Cause or For Good Reason. If PPG terminates the officer’s employment (other than for cause, death or disability) or the officer terminates his or her employment for good reason during the three-year period following a change in control, and upon certain terminations prior to a change in control or in connection with or in anticipation of a change in control, the officer is generally entitled to receive the following payments and benefits: ● a pro-rata bonus for the year of the date of termination based on the officer’s highest annual bonus during the three years prior to the change in control or the annual bonus for the most recent fiscal year after the change in control, whichever is higher (such higher amount referred to herein as the “highest annual bonus”); ● three times the officer’s annual base salary; ● three times the officer’s highest annual bonus; ● a lump-sum payment having an actuarial present value equal to the additional pension benefits the officer would have received if he or she had continued to be employed by PPG for an additional three years for purposes of both age and service credit, assuming the officer’s compensation for each such additional year is equal to his or her annual base salary prior to the change in control (or any higher salary thereafter) and his or her annual bonus is at least equal to the officer’s highest annual bonus during the three years prior to the change in control (the “Pension Differential”); ● a lump-sum payment equal to the present value of any employer contributions the executive would have received or accrued under PPG’s defined contribution retirement plans and arrangements (whether qualified or non-qualified) in which the executive participates if the executive’s employment continued for an additional three years in respect of ​ ​ ​ 72 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents retirement benefits provided in the form of a defined contribution retirement plan, program or arrangement, but excluding any salary or pay deferral contributions to such plans or arrangements that are deemed to be employer contributions under applicable law; ● continued medical, dental and life insurance benefits for three years and continued age and service credit for purposes of determining the officer’s eligibility for retiree medical benefits; ● continued payment of financial counseling expenses for the officer for three years; and ● a payment in an amount sufficient to make the officer whole for any excise tax on excess parachute payments imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The table below sets forth the amounts each executive officer named in the Summary Compensation Table would be entitled to receive, other than accrued but unpaid base salary and any benefits payable or provided under broad-based employee benefit plans and programs, in the event of a termination of the executive officer’s employment by PPG without cause or by the executive officer for good reason following or in connection with a change in control of PPG. For purposes of calculating the estimated potential payment to such executive officers with respect to the Pension Differential under the change in control agreements, as reflected in the table below, we have used the same actuarial factors and assumptions used for financial statement reporting purposes and set forth under Note 14 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is located on pages 58 through 64 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including a discount rate of 2.52% for Retirement Plan C and 2.38% for our U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plan and assuming a lump-sum payment of the Pension Differential. Termination During the 30-Day Window Period. Under certain of our change in control agreements, if an officer terminates his or her employment for any reason during a 30-day window period following the first anniversary of the change in control, the officer will be entitled to the payments and benefits described above, except that the multiplier of three referenced above would be two for purposes of all payments and benefits for which the multiplier is relevant. Definitions. For purposes of the agreements, the terms set forth below generally have the meanings described below. “Change in Control” generally includes the occurrence of any of the following events or circumstances: (i) the acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of PPG or the voting power of the outstanding voting securities of PPG, other than any acquisition from or by PPG or any PPG-sponsored employee benefit plan; (ii) the individuals who, as of the date of the agreement, constitute the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date of the agreement whose election, or nomination for election by the Company’s shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board are considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than the Board; (iii) shareholder approval of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all of the assets of PPG, unless following such transaction PPG’s historic shareholders retain at least 60% ownership of the surviving entity, no shareholder acquires a 20% or more ownership interest in the surviving entity and a majority of the surviving entity’s board of directors were members of our Board at the time such transaction was approved; (iv) shareholder approval of a dissolution or liquidation of PPG; or (v) a determination by a majority of our Board that a change in control has occurred. “Cause” generally means (i) the willful and continued failure of the officer to perform his or her duties; or (ii) the willful engaging by the officer in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to PPG. “Good reason” generally means (i) the assignment of duties inconsistent with the officer’s position, authority, duties or responsibilities in effect at the time of the change in control, or any other action resulting in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, other than isolated and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith that is remedied promptly; (ii) failure to provide the employment compensation and benefits required under the change in control agreement, other than an isolated and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith that is remedied promptly; or (iii) a relocation or substantial change in the officer’s workplace or the company’s requiring the officer to travel on company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the change in control. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 73 ​ Table of Contents Changes to Form of Change in Control Agreement. The Officers—Directors Compensation Committee has made modifications to the form of change in control agreement for officers in response to current trends in executive compensation and to a shareholder proposal that was supported by shareholders at the 2007 annual meeting of shareholders. PPG began entering into the revised agreements in 2008 with certain newly hired or promoted officers. Key revisions include: ● Modification of the definition of “change in control” to require “consummation” of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all of the assets of PPG. ● Modification of the definition of “compensation” to include “target” bonus instead of the “highest” bonus over the last three years. This change affects the cash payment and the Pension Differential calculation. ● Modification of certain termination provisions, including elimination of the window period termination. ● Modification of the excise tax and gross-up provision to replace the full gross up with a “conditional” gross up, which provides for a reduction in change in control payments if such payments trigger an excise tax by a limited amount. ● Elimination of the provisions providing for the payment of financial counseling and legal expenses. In subsequent years, the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee made additional modifications to the form of change in control agreement for officers in response to current trends in executive compensation. The key revisions include ● Elimination of the excise tax gross-up entirely. ● Including a “conditional” payment limitation, which provides for a reduction in change of control payments if such payments would trigger an excise tax, unless a larger amount would be received on an after-tax basis without a payment reduction. ● Modification of the definition of Retirement and the associated benefits related to retirement to ensure that all applicable provisions are applied properly for executives who only participated in the former PPG Defined Contribution Retirement Plan and non-U.S. executives who do not participate in either Retirement Plan C or the former Defined Contribution Retirement Plan. ● Elimination of potential double payments under other PPG severance provisions or statutory requirements and the change in control agreement. ​ ​ ​ 74 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Change in Control Involuntary or Good Reason Termination (2020) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ INVOLUNTARY OR ​ ​ GOOD REASON ​ ​ TERMINATION M.

The amount reflected in the table for this officer is not a present value amount, but the estimated aggregate payments over the officer’s lifetime, assuming the officer terminated employment with PPG on December 31, 2020 and payments commenced upon the date that the officer attains the earliest eligible retirement age provided under the Non-Qualified Pension Plan. (3) This officer is not retirement eligible as of December 31, 2020 and thereby not entitled to receive retiree health and welfare benefits. The amount reflected in the table for this officer is a present value amount for retiree medical benefits of the officer and his beneficiary based on their expected life. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 75 ​ Table of Contents Equity Acceleration In the event of a change in control of PPG, the Company stock plans and award agreements entered into prior to 2009 provide that the participant will be entitled to full vesting acceleration of his or her unvested stock options, TSR awards and restricted stock units. For award agreements entered into in 2009 and thereafter, in the event of a change in control of PPG, an executive must be terminated (or have a substantial diminution of job duties) to be entitled to full vesting acceleration of unvested stock options, TSR awards and restricted stock units. The table below reflects the calculation of the aggregate dollar values related to acceleration of vesting of the incentive equity awards held by the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in the event of a termination following a change in control, and the total is reflected in the “Accelerated Vesting of LTI” row for each officer in the table above. The stock option value was calculated by multiplying the number of unvested shares by the difference between the grant price and the closing stock price on December 31, 2020 ($144.22). If any stock options were underwater as of December 31, 2020, no value was assigned to such options. The TSR share and restricted stock unit value was calculated by multiplying the target number of unvested shares by the closing stock price on December 31, 2020, except as otherwise noted.

Total compensation amounts are required to be calculated using the Securities and Exchange Commission’s compensation disclosure rules applicable to reporting compensation in the Summary Compensation Table of the Proxy Statement. Median employee compensation used to calculate the pay ratio is required to be the total compensation paid to an actual employee of the company. We identified our median employee using our total employee population as of October 1, 2020 by applying a consistently applied compensation measure across our global employee population. For our consistently applied compensation measure, we used annual base salary. We used an annual base salary as our consistently applied compensation measure as it represents the primary compensation component paid to all of our employees. As a result, annual base salary provides an accurate depiction of total earnings for the purpose of identifying our median employee. We then calculated the median employee’s total annual compensation in accordance with the requirements of the Summary Compensation Table. We did not use any material estimates, assumptions, adjustments or statistical sampling to determine the worldwide median employee. Our median employee’s 2020 compensation was $43,783. Our Chief Executive Officer’s total 2020 compensation was $15,903,993 as reported in the Summary Compensation Table. Accordingly, our 2020 CEO to Median Employee Pay Ratio was 363:1. Each individual’s total annual compensation can be comprised of different compensation elements and is dependent on where the individual works globally. Please keep in mind that under Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and guidance, there are numerous ways to determine the compensation of a company’s median employee, including the employee population sampled, the elements of pay and benefits used, any assumptions made and the use of statistical sampling. In addition, no two companies have identical employee populations or compensation programs, and pay, benefits and retirement plans differ by country even within the same company. As such, our pay ratio may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 77 ​ Table of Contents PROPOSAL 2: Advisory Vote on Approval of the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires that we include in this Proxy Statement a non-binding, advisory shareholder vote on our executive compensation as described in this Proxy Statement (commonly referred to as “say-on-pay”). Based upon the vote of our shareholders at the 2011 and 2017 annual meetings and the Board’s recommendation, PPG has provided this advisory vote on an annual basis. We encourage shareholders to review the section of this Proxy Statement relating to executive compensation on pages 43 through 76. The Board believes that PPG’s executive compensation program aligns the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders. Executive compensation is based on our pay-for-performance philosophy, which emphasizes executive performance measures that correlate closely with the achievement of both shorter-term performance objectives and longer-term shareholder value. To this end, a substantial portion of our executives’ annual and long-term compensation is performance-based, with the payment being contingent on the achievement of performance goals. We believe our program strikes the appropriate balance between utilizing responsible, measured pay practices and effectively incentivizing our executives to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our shareholders. This balance is evidenced by the following: ● In 2020, the Company delivered solid financial performance despite the global COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted the Company’s 2020 performance and businesses. While some of our business units were positively impacted, our overall business suffered from significantly reduced market demand. Total net sales from continuing operations for 2020 were approximately $13.8 billion, down about 9% compared to 2019, including net unfavorable foreign currency translation of about 1%. The Company’s 2020 full-year reported net income from continuing operations was $1.1 billion, or $4.44 per diluted share versus $1.2 billion, or $5.22 per diluted share, in 2019. Full-year 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations decreased about 8% year-over-year to $5.70 compared with $6.22 in 2019. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for 2020 was $1.35 billion, versus $1.48 billion in 2019. ● In 2020, the Company generated approximately $2.3 billion in adjusted cash flow from operations, which is about $200 million higher than 2019. ● Our business portfolio demonstrated its resiliency during the pandemic with swift recovery of operating margins and record adjusted earnings per share in the second half of the year, up nearly 20 percent compared to the prior year. ● Operating working capital as a percent of sales improved 180 basis points compared to prior year. ● In September, the Company raised the per-share dividend by 6%—paying approximately $500 million in dividends in 2020. ● In 2020, the Company completed three acquisitions, increasing both geographic and product scope. Cash spending for these acquisitions totaled approximately $1.2 billion. ● Net capital expenditures totaled about $300 million, down versus the prior year reflecting the Company’s decisive actions to curtail non-essential spending during the peak of the pandemic. ● The Company’s stock price increased 8% during 2020 providing value to our shareholders. ​ ​ ​ 78 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents The following charts contain adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, net sales from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations as used for determining the compensation of our executive officers for each of the last five fiscal years: ​ ​ ​ ​ Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share from Continuing Operations Net Sales (In Millions USD) Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations (In Millions USD) ​ *2016 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share include $46 million ($0.17) for results of the flat glass business through September 30, 2016, which has been recast as discontinued operations for all periods presented but which is included in the compensation metric. **2017 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share include $15 million ($0.06) for the results of the North American fiber glass business through August 31, 2017, which has been recast as discontinued operations for all periods presented, but which is included in the compensation metric. These figures also include $20 million ($0.08) for the impact of raw materials and Puerto Rican business resulting from the 2017 natural disasters. ***2019 Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share includes $0.16 for the year-over-year impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for earnings per diluted share or net income or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. A Regulation G reconciliation of adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations to reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and net income from continuing operations is included in Annex A to this Proxy Statement. ● Although we had solid performance in 2020, we did not achieve our adjusted earnings per diluted share target or our sales volume/mix growth target. As discussed in the Compensation, Discussion and Analysis, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee applied discretion to the calculation of our annual incentive award in recognition of the decisive actions taken to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the Company’s efforts to drive growth and improve price during the year. As a result, annual incentive awards were paid to executive at 100% of target. Our total shareholder return over the past three years when measured against the S&P 500 was in the 53rd percentile resulting in the payment of long term TSR share awards at 85.5% of target. ● Between 70% and 89% of the named executive officers’ target total direct compensation opportunity for 2020 was in the form of performance-based variable compensation and long-term incentives motivating them to deliver strong business performance and create shareholder value. ● Base salary and annual incentive targets for our executive officers are established annually to maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions. Target total annual compensation for each position is set at or near the market median. ● PPG’s compensation programs are reviewed annually to identify any inherent material risks to PPG created by these programs. Based on the results of the 2020 review, we concluded that the design of our compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long-term value of PPG. ● At the 2020 annual meeting, we held a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a say-on-pay vote. Our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 95% of shareholder votes cast in favor of our 2020 say-on-pay resolution. Following its review of this vote, the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee recommended to the full Board that we retain our general approach to executive compensation, with an emphasis on short- and long-term incentive compensation that rewards our executive officers when they deliver value for our shareholders. Consistent with this philosophy: ● Our performance metrics are focused on increasing shareholder value and are tied to measures impacting both shorter-term and longer-term performance. Shorter-term performance metrics include adjusted earnings per diluted ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 79 ​ Table of Contents share from continuing operations, cash flow from operating activities–continuing operations, pre-tax, pre-interest income, working capital reduction, and sales volume/mix growth. Longer-term performance metrics include total shareholder return, adjusted earnings per diluted share growth, cash flow return on capital and stock price appreciation. ● Payment of long-term incentive awards is based solely on Company performance. We have three-year award and payout cycles for both performance-based restricted stock units, or PBRSUs, and total shareholder return shares, or TSR shares. We also have three-year vesting for stock options. ● We provide very limited perquisites to our executive officers. ● Our officers are subject to stock ownership requirements. Our Chief Executive Officer must own shares of PPG common stock with a value of six times his base salary, and the other executive officers must own shares of PPG common stock with a value of three times his or her base salary. Officers are expected to meet these ownership requirements within five years of election. Those officers who have not yet met this requirement are paid 20% of their annual incentive in PPG stock, which is restricted from sale for a period of two to five years. In addition, for officers who have been subject to the policy for more than five years at their current requirement level and have not met the ownership requirement, 100% of the vested shares delivered from the PBRSU award and TSR share award must be held by the officer for a minimum of one year and until the requirement is met. The executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table have met their ownership requirement, except for Ms. Liebert who joined the Company in June 2018 and Ms. Foulkes who was promoted to Senior Vice President and General Counsel in August 2018. Ms. Liebert and Ms. Foulkes are within the five-year compliance period. ● Our officers may not engage in transactions that are contrary to the interests of shareholders, such as “short sales,” “short sales against the box,” “put” and “call” options and hedging transactions designed to minimize an executive’s risk inherent in owning PPG stock. In addition, officers may not hold PPG stock in a margin account and may not pledge PPG stock as collateral for a loan. ● Executive officers are subject to a “clawback” policy that is designed to recoup incentive compensation when a financial restatement occurs and certain other conditions exist. ● We do not provide tax gross-ups on perquisites to our named executive officers. Accordingly, you are asked to vote on the following resolution: RESOLVED: The Board strongly endorses the Company’s executive compensation program and recommends that the shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution: that the shareholders approve the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement on pages 43 through 76 and disclosed in accordance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the tabular and narrative disclosure contained therein. Because the vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board or the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee, and neither the Board nor the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee will be required to take any action as a result of the outcome of the vote on this proposal. However, the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee will carefully consider the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation programs. Vote Required Adoption of the resolution approving the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers will require the affirmative vote of more than one-half of the shares present, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote and voting (excluding abstentions) at the Annual Meeting. ​ THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY’S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 80 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: Proposal to Amend the Articles of Incorporation to Provide for the Annual Election of Directors PPG’s Board of Directors has unanimously approved and is recommending that shareholders approve an amendment to PPG’s Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to provide for the phased-in elimination of the classified board of directors structure and the annual election of directors. At PPG’s 2012, 2013, 2018, 2019 and 2020 annual meetings of shareholders, PPG presented the same proposal for approval by the Company’s shareholders. In 2012, 2013, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the proposal received the affirmative vote of approximately 99% of the votes cast, but only approximately 67%, 68%, 74%, 79% and 74%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. Since PPG’s Articles of Incorporation require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock to approve a proposal to amend the Articles of Incorporation to declassify the Board, the proposals failed to receive the required vote. For the reasons discussed below, the Board of Directors has resolved to present this proposal to the Company’s shareholders again at this year’s Annual Meeting. In its review of our classified board structure, the Board has carefully weighed the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a classified board structure. The Board considered that many U.S. public companies have eliminated their classified board structures in recent years in favor of annual elections and that many investors now consider the election of directors to be the primary means for shareholders to influence corporate governance policies and to increase a board’s accountability. The Nominating and Governance Committee regularly considers and evaluates a broad range of corporate governance issues affecting PPG and takes into consideration feedback we receive from our shareholders. Our Board has responded to shareholder feedback on our classified board structure by placing management proposals to eliminate our classified board before our shareholders. By placing the weight of management behind these proposals, these proposals were more likely to achieve a successful vote than had the Board decided only to include shareholder proposals on this topic in our proxy statements, as exemplified by votes in favor of this proposal exceeding 74% at PPG’s three most recent annual meetings. After carefully weighing these considerations and shareholder opinion on this topic and the vote received on this proposal at PPG’s recent annual meetings, the Board concluded that the annual election of all directors will both enhance our corporate governance practices and be an effective way to maintain and enhance the accountability of the Board. Accordingly, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to eliminate the classified board structure. PPG’s Articles of Incorporation currently provide that the Board shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible with members of each class serving for three-year terms. If this proposal is approved, all directors will be elected annually beginning at the 2024 annual meeting. The directors to be elected at the 2021 Annual Meeting will be elected to serve a full three-year term. The directors to be elected at the 2022 annual meeting will be elected to serve a two-year term. The directors to be elected at the 2023 annual meeting will be elected to serve a one-year term. At the 2024 annual meeting and at each meeting of shareholders thereafter, all directors will be elected annually. Because the declassification process discussed in this proposal would not be complete until the 2024 annual meeting, it would not operate to shorten the upcoming term of any of our directors nominated for election at the 2021 Annual Meeting, ensuring a smooth transition to annual elections of all of our directors. All directors elected to fill vacancies will hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting at which the term of the class to which they have been elected expires. Complete Text of the Proposed Amendment The general description of the proposed amendment to PPG's Articles of Incorporation set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the proposed amendments to the Articles of Incorporation, which are attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement. If the proposal is approved, the Board will make conforming amendments to our Bylaws. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 81 ​ Table of Contents Vote Required The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required for approval of this proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against this proposal. If approved, the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation will become effective upon its filing with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which we intend to do following the Annual Meeting. If this proposal is not approved, the Board will remain classified. ​ THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT OF PPG’S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO PROVIDE FOR THE ANNUAL ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 82 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents PROPOSAL 4: Proposal to Amend the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to Replace the Supermajority Voting Requirements PPG’s Board of Directors has unanimously approved and is recommending that shareholders approve an amendment to PPG’s Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and PPG’s Amended and Restated Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements set forth therein. In 2014, 2015, 2019 and 2020, the Board considered this proposal, including the amount of shareholder support it received in the past, and proposed to amend PPG’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements with a simple majority vote or the closest standard to a simple majority vote allowed by Pennsylvania law. At our 2014, 2015, 2019 and 2020 annual meetings, the Board’s proposal to amend PPG’s Articles and Bylaws received the support of the holders of approximately 99% of the votes cast at the meeting but approximately 67%, 68%, 78% and 74%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. Since PPG’s Articles of Incorporation and certain sections of PPG’s Bylaws require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock to approve a proposal to replace the supermajority voting requirements, the proposals failed to receive the required vote. Considering the recent vote received on this proposal and shareholder opinion on this topic, including a shareholder proposal received this year, which the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed PPG to exclude from its Proxy Statement due to the inclusion of this Proposal 4, the Board is again proposing to amend PPG’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements with a simple majority vote or the closest standard to a simple majority vote allowed by Pennsylvania law. The Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the “Pennsylvania BCL”) provides that whenever any corporate action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders of a business corporation, it will be authorized upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon. PPG’s Articles of Incorporation currently require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of PPG’s outstanding common stock entitled to vote for shareholders to approve the following actions: ● repealing the classified board structure; ● changing the size of the Board beyond the parameters set forth in the Articles of Incorporation; ● removing a director from office outside of the annual meeting process; ● amending the provision of the Articles of Incorporation requiring a supermajority vote to approve certain business combinations with a party that owns 20% or more of PPG’s shares; and ● amending the director indemnification provisions. PPG’s Bylaws currently require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of PPG’s outstanding common stock entitled to vote in order for shareholders to approve the following actions: ● repealing the classified board structure; ● removing a director from office outside the annual meeting process; and ● amending the director liability and indemnification provisions. The proposed amendment to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws would reduce the voting requirements for these actions to require a vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote in each circumstance described above other than the business combination provision. The Pennsylvania BCL requires that certain business combinations between PPG and a person who owns 20% or more of PPG’s shares (an interested shareholder) receive the affirmative vote of no less than the majority of the votes cast if the transaction meets certain criteria. However, depending on the form of the transaction, approval may require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of outstanding common stock, excluding the votes of the interested shareholders, or may require the affirmative vote of all of the shares of outstanding common stock. Therefore, the vote required to approve such a transaction would be reduced to the minimum vote required by the Pennsylvania BCL. The Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining the supermajority voting requirements in PPG's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. Proponents of the elimination of supermajority voting requirements posit that these requirements impede accountability to shareholders ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 83 ​ Table of Contents and contribute to Board and management entrenchment. They argue that a minority of shareholders can block an initiative supported by a majority of shareholders and that a simple majority vote requirement should be sufficient for any corporate action requiring shareholder approval. In this regard, the Board gave considerable weight to the fact that the 2014, 2015, 2019 and 2020 management proposals each received a substantial majority of votes in favor of the proposal and to the opinion of current PPG shareholders on this topic. After carefully reviewing these considerations, the Nominating and Governance Committee determined, and the Board of Directors agreed, that it is in the best interest of PPG to replace the supermajority voting requirements. The Board concluded that replacement of the supermajority voting provisions will both enhance our corporate governance practices and be an effective way to maintain and enhance the accountability of PPG to its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to amend PPG's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements set forth therein. Conforming Changes to PPG's Bylaws PPG's Bylaws also include supermajority voting provisions relating to the repeal of the classified board structure, removal of a director from office outside of the annual meeting process and amendment of the director liability and indemnification provisions that are consistent with the same provisions in the Articles of Incorporation. Conditional upon approval by the shareholders of the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws described in this proposal, PPG's Board has voted to remove the supermajority voting standards from the Bylaws and replace them with a standard requiring the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast and entitled to vote. Complete Text of Proposed Amendment The general description of the proposed amendment to PPG's Articles of Incorporation and the proposed amendment to PPG's Bylaws set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the proposed amendments to the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws, which are attached as Annex C and Annex D, respectively, to this Proxy Statement. Proposed additions are underlined, and proposed deletions are stricken through. Vote Required The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required for approval of this proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against this proposal. If approved, the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation will become effective upon its filing with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which we intend to do following the Annual Meeting. If the proposal is approved, the Board will make conforming amendments to our Bylaws. If this proposal is not approved, the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws will remain unchanged. ​ THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT OF PPG’S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS TO REPLACE THE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING REQUIREMENTS. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 84 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Service Fees Paid to the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm In 2019 and 2020, we retained PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.

Base and statutory audit fees for 2020 totaled $8.7 million, down 5% from 2019 primarily due to cost savings initiatives. (2) Fees related to non-recurrent projects primarily related to acquisitions and divestitures and in 2019 for reimbursement of legal fees incurred by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. (3) Fees related to tax compliance, planning and advice. The services performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in 2020 were pre-approved in accordance with the Audit Committee pre-approval policy and procedures adopted at its April 15, 2020 meeting. Additional services were approved during the year as needed, in accordance with this policy. In so doing, the committee determined that the provision of these services is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant’s independence. In 2020, no services were provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that were approved by the committee after such services were performed. Audit Committee Pre-approval Policy The pre-approval policy describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP may perform and lists a range of fees for these services (referred to as the Service List). The services listed in the pre-approval policy are pre-approved by the Audit Committee. If a type of service to be provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is not included in the Service List, the committee must specifically pre-approve it. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings. However, the authority to pre-approve engagements has been delegated to the committee chair to accommodate time sensitive service proposals.

The shareholder proposal and the supporting statement are presented exactly as received from the proponent in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we disclaim any responsibility for their content. Shareholder Proposal Independent Board Chair PPG Industries, Inc. – 2021 ​ Resolved : Shareholders request the Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend the bylaws as necessary, to require that whenever possible the Chair of the Board of Directors be an independent member of the Board. This policy would phase in for the next CEO transition. If the Board determines that a Chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent, within a reasonable period it shall select a new Chair who satisfies the requirements of this policy. Compliance with this policy can be waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chair. Whereas: The role of the Board of Directors is to provide independent oversight of management and the CEO. Michael McGarry has served as PPG’s CEO since 2015 and the Chairman since 2016. Charles Bunch previously served in both roles from 2005 to 2015. S&P 500 companies are increasingly separating the roles, which strengthens corporate governance by enabling independent oversight and reducing conflicts of interest. 1 Proponents believe that the Board has underprioritized oversight of effective management of human rights risks and community impacts, resulting in increased risks and costs to shareholders. The manufacturing of paints and coatings presents risks to human health and the environment by exposing workers and communities to toxic substances. Human rights risks are also present in PPG’s supply chain, such as child labor in mica mining. Many of PPG’s inputs are associated with occupational health risks. Working with epoxies, resins, and solvents may increase risks of adverse reproductive effects, and titanium dioxide is a possible carcinogen. 2 PPG faces human capital management risks, including facing a consumer boycott by a labor union due to concerns that PPG’s web-based contracting service “threatens wages, standards, and benefits of the painting industry.” 3 PPG’s history of pollution has resulted in harm to communities, legal action, financial penalties, and reputational damage. PPG is responsible for paying $367 million to clean up industrial waste from a New Jersey chromium plant and a $5 million settlement to impacted property owners. 4 In 2019, PPG paid a $1.2 million penalty for environmental violations and is responsible for cleaning up toxic discharges from a glass plant in Pennsylvania. 5 1 https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-u-s-companies-separating-chief-executive-and-chairman-roles-11548288502 ​ 2 https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/repro/specificexposures.html; https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/13463677.html 3 https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/01/30/PPG-paints-boycott-painters-union- gig-economy-wages-Pittsburgh-wages-glidden-olympic/stories/202001300153; https://boycottppg.com/ 4 https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/ppg-responsible-for-dollar367-million-cleanup-cost-of-jersey-city- chromium-site-federal-appeals-court-says/ar-BB13HvaE; https://www.nj.com/hudson/2020/10/ppg-industries-reaches-5-million-settlement-with-jersey-city-homeowners-over-chromium-contamination.html 5 https://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2019/04/02/PPG-settlement-penalty-pollution-glass-plant-Ford-City-Armstrong-County/stories/201904020121; https://archive.triblive.com/local/valley-news-dispatch/judge-ppg-solely-liable-for-pollution-near-ford-city/ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 87 ​ Table of Contents PPG’s supply chains for commodities like mica present significant human rights risks, such as dangerous working conditions, child labor, and health risks. 6 The COVID-19 pandemic has deprived mica mining communities of their primary income stream due to lockdowns and decreased demand of mica-containing products like automotive paints. 7 PPG has a Global Code of Ethics and Supplier Code of Conduct. While its Board Audit Committee and Technology and Environment Committee oversee compliance with these Codes, the severity of PPG’s actual and potential human rights impacts in its operations and supply chain warrant increased Board oversight of human rights risks management. Board of Directors’ Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal PPG’s Board believes that the interests of its shareholders are best served when the Board has the flexibility to determine PPG’s leadership structure . Under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board has the authority to determine whether the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer should be held by the same or different persons. The shareholder proposal seeks to mandate one rigid leadership structure for all circumstances and would therefore prevent our directors from determining the most appropriate leadership structure for PPG’s Board at any given time. The Board believes that the Company and its shareholders are best served when the Board holds the ability to determine its own leadership structure. The Board has determined that the appropriate structure for the Board at this time is for Mr. McGarry, our Chief Executive Officer, to serve as Chairman of the Board, while also providing for the counterbalance of a strong independent Lead Director role, fully independent Board committees, and other good governance practices as described below and elsewhere in this Proxy Statement. The Board believes that Mr. McGarry is the best person to serve as Chairman because he is the director most familiar with our business and industry and the director most capable of identifying strategic priorities and executing our business strategy. The Board believes the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer serves as a highly effective bridge between the Board and management and provides the leadership to execute our business strategy and create shareholder value. In addition, having one person serve as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer demonstrates to our employees, suppliers, customers, shareholders and other stakeholders that PPG has strong leadership setting the tone and having the responsibility for managing our operations. Having a single leader eliminates the potential for confusion and provides clear leadership for PPG. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, having Mr. McGarry serve as both Chairman and CEO allowed us to quickly build consensus around the steps necessary to protect our employees and our business. At least annually, the Board reexamines our corporate governance policies and Board leadership structure to ensure that it provides the optimal structure for PPG given the circumstances at the time. While the Board believes that the current combined role of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer strikes an appropriate balance that does not constrain independent oversight and that Mr. McGarry is the best person to serve as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Board recognizes that in the future there may be circumstances under which an independent board chairman would be appropriate. PPG’s Board has implemented robust governance structures and practices that provide for accountability, strong independent leadership, and effective independent oversight of the Company. ● The Board has appointed an independent Lead Director with broad responsibilities that are clearly defined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, including: ● serving as chairman of the meetings of the independent directors and all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present; ● authority to call meetings of the independent directors; ● facilitating communications and serving as a liaison between the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the independent directors; ● communicating to the Chairman any suggestions, views or concerns expressed by the independent directors and being available to consult with the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer about the concerns of the Board; 6 https://www.somo.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NL180313_GLOBAL-MICA-MINING-.pdf; https://www.somo.nl/child-labour-in-madagascars-mica-sector/ 7 https://responsible-mica-initiative.com/responsible-mica-initiative-participates-in-emergency-response-to-mitigate-covid-19s-impact-on-mica-dependent-communities; https://investor.ppg.com/news/news-details/2020/PPG-Reports-Record-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx ​ ​ ​ 88 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents ● approving Board meeting agendas and other types of information sent to the Board and facilitating efficient and effective Board functioning; ● approving meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; ● being available for consultation and direct communication with major shareholders as appropriate; ● participating in the identification and evaluation of director candidates and facilitating director development; ● establishing a close relationship and trust with the Chief Executive Officer and acting as a resource for and advisor to the Chief Executive Officer; ● unless otherwise directed by the Board, serving as the independent directors’ representative in extraordinary matters such as significant corporate transactions and crisis situations; ● recommending to the Board the formation and membership of ad-hoc committees of the Board to oversee extraordinary matters such as significant corporate transactions and crisis situations; and ● authorizing the retention of outside advisors and consultants who report directly to the Board on Board-wide issues. Through these responsibilities, the Lead Director provides independent oversight of management and meaningful coordination between our Chairman and our independent directors. ● With the exception of Mr. McGarry, the Board is comprised entirely of independent directors, as determined under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the categorical independence standards adopted by the Board in PPG’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our independent directors collectively bring to the board vast leadership experience, industry expertise, and other critical skills, and they have individually demonstrated the willingness to think and act independently on behalf of our shareholders. The Board continually reviews its composition with a focus on refreshing necessary skill sets to oversee management’s execution of the company’s strategy, and we have added seven new independent directors since 2015. ● Each of the Audit Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee, Officers-Directors Compensation Committee and Technology and Environment Committee is comprised solely of independent directors. This means only the independent directors oversee critical matters such as the quality and integrity of our financial statements; our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; corporate governance; the performance and compensation of our executive officers, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; the nomination of directors; the evaluation of the Board and its committees; and our sustainability initiatives. ● As required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our independent directors meet separately, without management present, at each meeting of the Board. In addition, our Board committees meet in executive session on a regular basis without the presence of management. ● All directors have the ability to suggest items for inclusion on the agenda and may raise at any Board meeting subjects that are not on the agenda for that meeting. All directors also have complete access to management, and the Board and its committees have the authority to retain legal, accounting and other outside consultants to advise the Board or committees as they deem appropriate. Because of these strong governance structures, the Board does not believe that a policy mandating an independent Chairman is necessary to achieve effective independent leadership and management oversight. It is instructive that over 60% of S&P 500 companies do not require an independent chairman of the board as required by the shareholder proposal. According to the Spencer Stuart U.S. Board Index 2019, only 34% of S&P 500 companies have an independent chairman of the board (the index is available at https://www.spencerstuart.com/research-and-insight). The Board believes that having a single leader for our Company with oversight of Company operations and extensive Company leadership experience, coupled with an independent Lead Director with significant responsibilities, makes it unnecessary to have an absolute requirement that the Chairman be an independent director. PPG’s Board believes that our policies and operations embody PPG’s respect for human rights . PPG is strongly committed to supporting and maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct and respect for human rights. PPG and the Board of Directors are strongly committed to promoting social responsibility, human rights and sustainability throughout our operations. PPG has met with the proponent on multiple occasions to discuss our human rights and sustainability initiatives and to highlight PPG’s continued progress in these areas. PPG’s respect for human rights is embedded in the PPG’s Global Code of Ethics. Our Global Code of Ethics, which applies to our directors, officers, employees, consultants and contractors, provides, among other things, for: the respect for the dignity of human rights of all people; PPG’s commitment to an inclusive workplace that values the diversity of our ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 89 ​ Table of Contents employees; compliance with all laws pertaining to freedom of association, privacy, collective bargaining, immigration, working time, wages and hours; a prohibition on forced, compulsory and child labor, human trafficking and employment discrimination; a workplace free from harassment and bullying; and PPG’s commitment to workplace safety and to protecting the environment. Like the proponent, the Board of Directors recognizes the importance of working to ensure that those seeking to do business with PPG also respect basic human rights. In 2020, PPG adopted a revised Global Supplier Code of Conduct that expressly states PPG’s expectation that its suppliers, as well as their subcontractors, will fully comply with applicable laws and will adhere to internationally recognized environmental, social and corporate governance standards, PPG’s global expectations in the areas of business integrity, labor practices, health, safety and environmental management, and PPG’s commitments to human rights principles. In addition, PPG has enhanced its supplier evaluation, audit and sustainability program, which covers, among other areas, human rights. The proponent’s supporting statement identified the risk of exposure by employees and communities to potentially hazardous raw materials and products as a reason for the proposal. Under the oversight of the Board’s fully independent Technology and Environment Committee, PPG employs extensive programs to assess the materials used in its products, reduce its use of substances of concern, manage its environmental impact, and protect its employees and communities from potentially hazardous materials. PPG protects the health of its employees and supervised workers through a comprehensive industrial hygiene program, which has been in place for more than 50 years. PPG is also working to eliminate substances of concern from its products. PPG assesses substances for deselection and maintains a Restricted Substances List that applies to all PPG products globally. During a new product’s research and development phase, PPG assesses raw materials for their safety using a toxicology screening assessment. The proponent’s supporting statement notes that one of PPG’s salient human rights risks is the use of mica. PPG is a founding member of the Responsible Mica Initiative (“RMI”) and an active participant in its initiatives to improve the mica supply chain. RMI’s website, http//www.responsible-mica-initiative.com, contains substantial information about the activities of the RMI, including supply chain mapping, setting compliant workplace standards and community empowerment.  These activities benefit RMI’s members the mica supply chain, including 80 local communities in India. PPG has also been and continues to be an industry leader in environmental sustainability. We have significantly reduced our greenhouse gas emissions, waste intensity and spill and release rates, and we are a member of the World Alliance for Efficient Solutions. You can find more information about our efforts and achievements in the areas of sustainability and human rights under Sustainability, Culture and Human rights beginning on page 6 and at www.sustainability.ppg.com. Given the strong independent Board oversight of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s robust corporate governance structures, including an empowered and effective independent Lead Director and effective Board oversight of PPG’s sustainability efforts, the Board does not believe that a fixed policy requiring an independent Chairman is in the best interests of shareholders. Vote Required Adoption of the shareholder proposal requesting the Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend the bylaws as necessary, to require that whenever possible the Chair of the Board of Directors be an independent member of the Board, will require the affirmative vote of more than one half of the shares present, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote and voting (excluding abstentions) at the Annual Meeting.

(2) Shares of common stock considered to be “beneficially owned” include both common stock actually owned and shares of common stock as to which there is a right to acquire ownership on, or within 60 days after, February 19, 2021. These amounts reflect shares subject to options exercisable within 60 days of February 19, 2021: as follows: Mr. McGarry, 380,302; Ms. Foulkes, 14,350; Mr. Knavish, 27,651; and Mr. Morales, 41,972.

However, the Board of Directors will take into account the outcome of the vote on this proposal when making future decisions about the Company's executive compensation arrangements, policies and procedures. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. ● Proposals 3 and 4: At least 80% of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must vote for the proposals for them to be adopted. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against these proposals. ● Proposals 5 and 6: More than one-half of the shares present, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote and voting (excluding abstentions) at the Annual Meeting must vote for the proposal for it to be adopted.

You may vote your shares by any one of the following methods: ● By Internet: Log onto the website indicated in the Notice of Internet Availability or on the proxy card or vote instruction form. ● By telephone: Call the toll-free number shown on the proxy card or vote instruction form and follow the voice prompts. ● By mail: Mark your votes, sign and return the proxy card or vote instruction form in the postage-paid envelope provided. ● By ballot: Attend the Annual Meeting virtually and vote online during the meeting. If you vote by the Internet or by telephone, you do not need to send in a proxy card or vote instruction form. The deadline for Internet and telephone voting will be 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 14, 2021. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, and you wish to vote your shares online while attending the virtual Annual Meeting, you will need to contact your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a legal proxy form that you must submit to Corporate Election Services when you register to attend the meeting. What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions? The Board of Directors is asking for your proxy. Giving us your proxy means that you authorize us to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting in the manner you direct. If you (1) choose the “submit your vote” option without voting on each individual proposal when voting on the Internet or by telephone or (2) if you are a shareholder of record and sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then your shares will be voted in the manner recommended by our Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement. If your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, the broker, bank or nominee will ask you how you want to vote your shares. If you give the broker, bank or nominee instructions, your shares will be voted as you direct. If you do not give instructions, your broker, bank or nominee may vote your shares in its discretion for the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2021 (Proposal 5), but your broker, bank or nominee will not vote your shares at all with respect to any of the other proposals. We encourage you to provide instructions to your bank, broker or nominee by carefully following the instructions provided. This will ensure that your shares are voted at the Annual Meeting as you direct. How can I change or revoke my vote after I have voted? You have the right to change your vote or revoke your proxy before it is exercised at the Annual Meeting. You may vote again on a later date on the Internet or by telephone (only your latest Internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted), by signing and returning a new proxy card or vote instruction form with a later date, or by attending the virtual Annual Meeting and voting online during the meeting. However, your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote again at the Annual Meeting or specifically request in writing that your prior proxy be revoked. Please note that any re-votes by mail or proxy revocations must be received by our corporate secretary at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272 prior to the Annual Meeting in order to be effective. ​ ​ ​ 96 2021 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents How will shares in employee benefit plans be voted?

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania March 4, 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Proxy Statement 99 ​ Table of Contents ANNEX A RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PPG believes investor’s understanding of the Company’s performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations adjusted for certain items. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the Company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and should not be considered a substitute for net income and earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies. Net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) and earnings per share – assuming dilution (attributable to PPG) are reconciled to adjusted net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) and adjusted earnings per share – assuming dilution below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 ​ 2019 ​ 2018 ​ 2017 ​ 2016 FOR THE YEAR-ENDED ​ NET INCOME ​ NET INCOME ​ NET INCOME ​ NET INCOME ​ NET INCOME (MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) $ EPS (3) $ EPS (3) $ EPS (3) $ EPS (3) $ EPS (3) Net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) ​ $ 1,056 ​ $ 4.44 ​ $ 1,243 ​ $ 5.22 ​ $ 1,323 ​ $ 5.40 ​ $ 1,369 ​ $ 5.31 ​ $ 543 ​ $ 2.04 Net charges related to business restructuring-related costs (1) ​ 166 ​ ​ 0.70 ​ 168 ​ ​ 0.71 ​ 53 ​ ​ 0.21 ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 141 ​ 0.53 Charges related to asset impairments ​ ​ 64 ​ ​ 0.27 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 11 ​ ​ 0.05 ​ ​ 7 ​ ​ 0.03 ​ ​ 17 ​ ​ 0.06 Charges related to an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts due to the global pandemic ​ ​ 23 ​ ​ 0.10 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — Net charges related to environmental remediation and other costs ​ 19 ​ ​ 0.08 ​ 47 ​ ​ 0.20 ​ 58 ​ ​ 0.24 ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 51 ​ 0.20 Expenses incurred due to natural disasters ​ ​ 13 ​ ​ 0.06 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — Charges related to acquisition-related costs (2) ​ ​ 7 ​ ​ 0.03 ​ ​ 13 ​ ​ 0.05 ​ ​ 4 ​ ​ 0.02 ​ ​ 6 ​ ​ 0.02 ​ ​ 5 ​ ​ 0.03 Charge related to early retirement of debt ​ 5 ​ ​ 0.02 ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 5 ​ 0.02 Net charges related to litigation matters ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 9 ​ ​ 0.04 ​ 19 ​ ​ 0.08 ​ (11) ​ ​ (0.04) ​ — ​ — Net tax (benefit)/charge related to U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ (13) ​ ​ (0.05) ​ ​ 134 ​ ​ 0.52 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — Gains from the sale of non-operating assets ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ (20) ​ ​ (0.08) ​ ​ (8) ​ ​ (0.03) ​ ​ — ​ ​ — Charges related to a customer assortment change ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 14 ​ ​ 0.05 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — Charges related to pension settlements ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 38 ​ ​ 0.14 ​ ​ 616 ​ ​ 2.31 Gain from sale of business ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ (24) ​ ​ (0.09) ​ — ​ — Net tax effect of asbestos settlement funding ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 151 ​ 0.57 Net gain from disposals of ownership interests in business affiliates ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ (30) ​ (0.12) Adjusted net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) ​ $ 1,353 ​ ​ 5.70 ​ $ 1,480 ​ ​ 6.22 ​ $ 1,449 ​ ​ 5.92 ​ $ 1,511 ​ ​ 5.86 ​ $ 1,499 ​ $ 5.64 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (1) Included in net charges related to business restructuring-related costs, are business restructuring charges, accelerated depreciation of certain assets and other related costs, offset by releases related to previously approved programs.

(c) “Referee” means an attorney with substantial expertise in corporate law who neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent:  (i) the Corporation or the Indemnitee, or an affiliate of either of them, in any matter material to either such party, except to act as a Referee in similar proceedings, or (ii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this Article.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, to the extent that there has been a determination by a court as to the conduct of an Indemnitee such that indemnification would not be prohibited by Pennsylvania law, or if an Indemnitee would be entitled by Pennsylvania law to indemnification, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder.
