We know that diverse teams perform better – period. Providing equitable experiences for all our people results in higher engagement, increased business performance and more opportunities for all. We will continue to elevate and celebrate underrepresented communities, while combating intolerance in all forms, both inside and outside of our workplaces. In March 2022, we published our first Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Report, including a link to our EEO-1 report, which is available at www.inclusion.ppg.com . ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Achievements ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2025 DE&I Vision & Strategy ​ ​ 100% Human Rights Rating ​ ​ Launched DE&I Ambassador Group ​ ​ Diverse Candidates ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Launched the 2025 diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) Vision & Strategy, inclusive of nine employee commitments to continue to advance our global DE&I efforts and ensure a data-driven, measurable approach. ​ ​ Earned a 100% rating on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2022 Corporate Equality Index, which is a national benchmarking tool that ranks corporations’ policies and benefits pertinent to LGBTQ employees. ​ ​ Launched an internal DE&I ambassador group composed of members of our global leadership teams. These global ambassadors serve as change agents across the Company, helping embed a sense of belonging for all. ​ ​ Launched a pilot program in the U.S. using labor market data to build diverse candidate slates for recruitment. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Unconscious Bias Training ​ ​ Employee Resource Networks ​ ​ Improving Employee Benefits ​ ​ Acquisitions Advance Our Diversity ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Extended our unconscious bias training efforts, with a primary focus on people managers. ​ ​ Expanded our Employee Resource Networks (“ERNs”) by further empowering three existing networks and launching five additional networks for increased representation.

Our efforts are focused on education, employee engagement and community sustainability, three areas that represent an intersection of our business strengths and our ability to create positive impacts across our communities. Within education, we seek to build the next generation of diverse and innovative leaders in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (“STEM”). Our community sustainability investments deliver community transformations through colorful spaces, support essential needs (particularly in times of disaster), and provide opportunities to thrive in service of social justice. We activate the time and talent of our employees to make a difference in our local communities. Throughout all of our community engagement activities, we integrate and uphold our values of diversity, equity and inclusion. Together with our community partners, employees and investments, we work to create pathways and impacts that address systemic racism and advance social justice. Our work during the pandemic was a continuation of our focus on communities every day. PPG and the PPG Foundation collaborate and engage with employees, community partners and other stakeholders to make our vision of bringing color and brightness to communities a reality. We dedicate financial contributions, apply our products and use the power of our employee volunteers to address the needs of our local communities and transform lives. Our global giving totaled more than $13 million in 2021, supporting hundreds of community organizations worldwide. To ensure this investment had the greatest impact, we focused our resources on the areas that we are best positioned to support – education, community sustainability and employee engagement. Our COLORFUL COMMUNITIES ® program represents a 10-year, $10 million commitment, bringing together PPG volunteers, local nonprofits, government organizations, PPG products and financial support to provide a fresh coat of paint, rejuvenated energy and sense of pride to community and educational spaces in need of a refresh. Despite the limited opportunities for in-person projects due to the COVID-19 environment, we completed 56 COLORFUL COMMUNITIES projects around the world in 2021. Since the inception of the program in 2015, the Company has completed more than 385 projects across 42 countries, impacting more than 6.8 million people. In 2021, PPG and the PPG Foundation outlined a commitment to invest $20 million by 2025 to address systemic racism and advance racial equity in the U.S. by funding educational pathways for Black communities and people of color. The commitment strengthens PPG's focus on education – a priority giving area for PPG and the PPG Foundation – and furthers its support of STEM education. In 2021, we made progress toward achieving this important commitment by supporting programs that spark an early interest in exploration and discovery and encourage curiosity in the possibilities of STEM studies; help students see the connections between STEM ideas and real-life innovations and careers; and support diverse students entering advanced, post-secondary STEM studies. We are committed to doing even more in the cities and neighborhoods that we call home. We will engage with our communities, our customers and our employees, to listen, learn and take action. As a global company, PPG can make a difference. Our purpose states that “we protect and beautify the world,” and this has never been more important than now. ​ ​ ​ ​ 8 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Our Environment At PPG, we are committed to using resources efficiently and driving sustainability throughout our entire value chain to preserve and protect the environment where our customers and employees live, work and play. Our focused product portfolio of paints, coatings and specialty materials enables a concerted and disciplined approach to developing sustainable products and processes that create value and deliver sustainability benefits to our customers, suppliers and a variety of stakeholders. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 Achievements ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Sustainably Advantaged Products ​ ​ Zero Process Waste ​ ​ Waste Efficiency ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 38% ​ ​ 40% ​ ​ ⇩ 42% ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 38% of sales from products and processes with improved sustainability, allowing customers to reduce their environmental impact ​ ​ 40% of manufacturing and research and development locations with zero process waste to landfill ​ ​ 42% reduction in the quantity of waste disposed from our 2017 baseline ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Waste Disposal Intensity ​ ​ Spill and Release Rate ​ ​ Greenhouse Gas Emissions ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ⇩ 37% ​ ​ ⇩ 30% ​ ​ ⇩ 15% ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 37% reduction in PPG’s waste disposal intensity from our 2017 baseline, after already meeting our 2025 goal in 2019 - 6 years ahead of schedule ​ ​ 30% reduction in PPG’s spill and release rate from our 2017 baseline ​ ​ 15% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from our 2017 baseline Minimizing the footprint of our operations is an ongoing focus, and our locations are guided by our 2025 sustainability goals, outlined at sustainability.ppg.com. In 2021, we furthered our commitment to progress through key actions, including: ● Created the new position and appointed our first Vice President of Global Sustainability and developed a dedicated sustainability team; ● Established a framework of oversight responsibility for all major elements of our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) efforts by our Board and its committees; ● Refocused and renamed our Technology and Environment Committee as the Sustainability and Innovation Committee, with a key focus on tracking our sustainability progress and evaluating climate risks and opportunities; ● Integrated the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Framework into our business strategic planning process in order to better understand our risks and opportunities; and ● Established groundwork to define and quantify our scope 3 emissions in order to establish Science-Based Targets aligned with the Paris Agreement. One example of our commitment to environmental sustainability is PPG’s Carrollton, Texas facility, which has partnered with Constellation, a leading energy solutions provider, to power its paint manufacturing operations with clean, renewable energy from the 200 megawatt Big Star Solar Project. Through a 10-year agreement, PPG will procure approximately 4.6 million kilowatt hours of energy per year from Big Star, avoiding more than 3,200 metric tons of carbon emissions annually, the equivalent of taking more than 700 cars off the road according to U.S. EPA estimates. Furthermore, PPG worked alongside an energy company to develop a combined heat and power plant that launched in 2021 to support its automotive and industrial coatings manufacturing facilities in Caivano and Quattordio, Italy. Through the partnership, the cogeneration plant burns natural gas to produce electricity then recaptures the heat that is often lost in conventional power generation facilities. That heat is then transmitted to the PPG plant through a system that connects the two facilities, resulting in a 15% reduction in carbon emissions. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 9 ​ Table of Contents In addition to our operations and our customers’ operations, PPG recognizes its role in minimizing the environmental impact of our products throughout their entire life cycle. Our Product Stewardship Management System and an updated sustainable product assessment process are the bedrocks of our process. To ensure sustainable business practices, the management system covers the full scope of the product life cycle – from material sourcing to product development and application, including hazard communication and chemical regulatory compliance, safe transport of dangerous goods and customer response to end-of-life requirements. ​ ​ PPG has launched a number of sustainable offerings for our customers in our efforts to achieve our 2025 goal of 40% of sales from sustainable advantaged products.

We respect the dignity and human rights of all people. As stated in our Global Code of Ethics, available at www.ppg.com, we comply with all laws pertaining to freedom of association, privacy, collective bargaining, immigration, working time, and wages and hours in our operations throughout the world. We also uphold laws prohibiting forced, compulsory and child labor, human trafficking and employment discrimination.

We strive for a collaborative environment in which everyone is embraced for their differences and has an equal chance to succeed. ​ ​ ​ 10 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents We base employment decisions on job qualifications and merit, which include education, experience, skills, ability and performance. We give equal employment opportunity to – and will not discriminate against – individuals on the basis of any status protected by applicable laws. A key PPG value is to ensure our people return home safely each day. We are actively working toward a goal of zero injuries by engaging with our employees to improve our operating practices around the world, investing in a safe work environment and running our business with sound operating practices.

We are also committed to preserving and protecting the environment in which we operate at all of our locations around the world. Minimizing the footprint of our operations is an ongoing focus, and our locations are guided by our sustainability goals. Our Product Stewardship Management System aims to minimize the human health and environmental impacts of our products throughout their entire life cycle and to eliminate substances of concern from our products. We have standards and processes in place to help ensure our products are developed, used and disposed of safely. We expect all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners to respect and uphold our commitment to human rights in their operations. ​ ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ​ ​ Our recently revised Global Supplier Code of Conduct clarifies our global expectations in the areas of business integrity, labor practices, associate health and safety, and environmental management Specific requirements relating to human rights include: ● Treating employees fairly, including with respect to wages, working hours and benefits ● Prohibiting all forms of forced or compulsory labor ● Prohibiting the use of child labor ● Respecting employees’ right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, consistent with local laws ● Providing safe and healthy working conditions ● Conducting operations with environmental diligence and complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations ● Delivering products and services meeting applicable quality and health and safety standards Our Supplier Sustainability Policy builds upon our Global Supplier Code of Conduct by establishing expectations for sustainability within our supply chain. This policy reinforces our expectations that our suppliers, as well as their subcontractors, will comply fully with applicable laws and adhere to internationally recognized environmental, social and corporate-governance standards. Each supplier must evaluate and maintain sustainable processes and raw material sources throughout their supply chain and supplier base. We also encourage our suppliers to innovate and develop new products requiring less intensive material and energy consumption, along with leveraging their collective strengths to help us meet our sustainability goals. We believe that our Company and communities benefit when we provide equal opportunities for diverse suppliers to compete for new and current business opportunities. By including qualified diverse suppliers in the purchasing process to provide products and services that meet our requirements, PPG will strengthen the position of our suppliers, customers, and our own organization. Our vision is to operate a world-class supplier diversity program, recognizing all people and representing One PPG. We are committed to economically empowering disadvantaged and underrepresented businesses by providing a level playing field and an environment for all to compete for PPG business opportunities. To support our supplier sustainability program, PPG has engaged EcoVadis TM , a leading global corporate social responsibility and sustainability ratings company, to leverage assessment processes, tools, resources and insights to drive sustainability standards and practices throughout PPG's global supply base. The EcoVadis sustainability intelligence suite assists PPG in providing broad-scale supply chain risk screening and mapping, more reliable supplier sustainability metric scorecards with actionable ratings, and complete audit and improvement management capabilities. This evaluation will help to ensure PPG suppliers around the world are equally as committed to sustainability. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 11 ​ Table of Contents In addition, suppliers are a focus of our human rights due diligence process. We evaluate their commitment and adherence to human rights through our supplier onboarding process, assessments of our top suppliers globally and annual audits of selected suppliers. We are also an active member of the RESPONSIBLE MICA INITIATIVE ® (“RMI”), which aims to mobilize the supply chain to eradicate child labor in India’s mica mines through traceability efforts and community-building activities. RMI’s holistic approach implements three program pillars simultaneously: ● Mica supply chain mapping and workplace standards for mica collection and processing; ● Community empowerment, including improved educational resources and alternative means of livelihood, in villages that provide the mica workforce; and ● Legal frameworks for the mica sector . Additional information about the steps we have taken to ensure human rights are respected in our own operations and within our supply chain can be found in our California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Statement and Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, available at PPG.com Employees, suppliers and other third parties can anonymously report suspected human rights violations within our operations and those of our suppliers through the PPG Ethics Helpline. The helpline is managed by an independent, third-party firm, and we investigate each allegation thoroughly and fairly. In the event of any non-compliant activity or violation of the code, the supplier may be required to provide a detailed corrective action plan to address the deficiency. We reserve the right to terminate any agreement with any supplier that cannot demonstrate compliance with the code.

It is intended that the shares represented by each proxy will be voted, in the discretion of the proxies, FOR the nominees for directors set forth below, each of whom is an incumbent, or for any substitute nominee or nominees designated by our Board of Directors in the event any nominee or nominees become unavailable for election. In the event that an incumbent director receives a greater number of votes against their election than votes for such election, they are required to tender their resignation for consideration by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors in accordance with our Bylaws, as under “Director Resignation Policy.” The principal occupations of, and certain other information regarding, the nominees and our continuing directors are set forth below. In addition, information about each director’s specific experience, attributes and skills that led the Board to the conclusion that each of the directors is highly qualified to serve as a member of the Board is set forth below. Mr. Faraci turned 72 before the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that any director who has attained the age of 72 retire at the next annual meeting following the director's 72nd birthday. Thus, Mr. Faraci will resign from our Board of Directors effective at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Company thanks Mr. Faraci for his many years of dedicated service to PPG. The Board believes that each of the Company’s directors is highly qualified to serve as a member of the Board. Each of our directors has contributed to the mix of skills, core competencies and qualifications of the Board. Our directors are highly educated and have diverse backgrounds and talents and extensive track records of success in what we believe are highly relevant positions with some of the most admired organizations in the world. Many of our directors also benefit from an intimate knowledge of our operations and corporate philosophy. The Board believes that each director’s service as the chairman, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, president, chief financial officer or group president of a well-respected company has provided the directors with skills that are important to serving on our Board. The Board has also considered the fact that all of our directors have worked for, or served on the boards of directors of, a variety of companies in a wide range of industries. Specifically, the Board has noted that our directors have skills that, among others, have made them particularly suited to serve as a director of PPG, a global manufacturer and retailer of high technology paints, coatings and specialty materials for industrial and consumer markets, with operations in more than 75 countries and approximately $16.8 billion in sales. The Board believes that through their varying backgrounds, our directors bring a wealth of experiences, new ideas and solutions to our Board. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors elected Michael T. Nally and Guillermo Novo as directors of PPG, effective that day, and assigned them to the class of directors whose term expires at the 2024 Annual Meeting. PPG’s Board is divided into three classes. Terms of the classes are staggered, with one class standing for election each year. The Board assigned Messrs. Nally and Novo to the class of directors whose term expires at the 2024 Annual Meeting as a matter of good corporate governance to bring these new directors before the Company’s shareholders at the next annual meeting after their election to the Board. PPG’s Articles of Incorporation currently provide that the Board shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible with members of each class serving for three-year terms. Because the addition of Messrs. Nally and Novo to the class of directors standing for election at the 2021 Annual Meeting created an imbalance in the membership of the three classes, the Board of Directors re-balanced the membership of the classes in July 2021 by placing Mr. Nally in the class of directors whose term expires at the 2022 Annual Meeting and by placing Mr. Novo in the class of directors whose term expires at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Vote Required Each director nominee who receives a majority of the votes cast (the number of shares voted “for” the director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director) at the Annual Meeting will be elected as a director. THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE DIRECTOR NOMINEES. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 16 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Nominees to Serve in a Class Whose Term Expires in 2025 consolidated master limited partnerships formed by Marathon Petroleum Corporation. ​ ​ ​ Gary R.

Using a skills matrix that includes the experience and skills of our current directors and keeping in mind the skills that the Board believes would add to the capabilities and knowledge of our Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee regularly reviews the skills and experience of our directors and potential director candidates. More information about the skills and experience of our directors can be found in the matrix on page 15 and within the biographies of our directors beginning on page 17. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that any director who has attained the age of 72 retire at the next annual meeting following the director's 72nd birthday. Nine new directors have joined the Board since the end of 2014. Since the end of 2012, the average age of our directors has decreased from 64 to 62 and our average director tenure has decreased from approximately 10 years to approximately six years. Although our average tenure has fallen with the addition of new directors, the Board believes that it is important to have longer-serving directors on the Board who have an intimate knowledge of our operations and our corporate philosophy. These longer-serving directors have also guided PPG through the peaks and troughs of the business cycle and can share this experience with our newer directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not a have formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director candidates. However, we endeavor to have a Board representing diverse experience at policy-making levels in business, government, education and technology, and in areas that are relevant to the Company’s global activities. The Nominating and Governance Committee seeks to find director candidates who have demonstrated executive leadership ability and who are representative of the broad scope of shareholder interests by identifying candidates from varied industries having diverse cultural or ethnic backgrounds, viewpoints and ages. The Nominating and Governance Committee believes that the current members of the Board provide this diversity as discussed more specifically on page 14. Director Independence In accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Board affirmatively determines the independence of each director and nominee for election or appointment as a director in accordance with the categorical guidelines it has adopted, which include all objective standards of independence set forth in the exchange listing standards. Based on these standards, at its meeting held on February 17, 2022, the Board determined that each of the following non-employee directors is independent and has no material relationship with PPG, except as a director and shareholder: ​ ​ Stephen F. Angel Michael W. Lamach Steven A. Davis Kathleen A. Ligocki John V. Faraci Michael T. Nally Hugh Grant Guillermo Novo Melanie L. Healey Martin H. Richenhagen Gary R. Heminger Catherine R. Smith In addition, based on such standards, the Board affirmatively determined that Michael H. McGarry is not independent because he is an officer of PPG. The categorical independence standards adopted by the Board are contained in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, which may be accessed from the Corporate Governance section of our website at investor.ppg.com. Board Leadership Structure We believe our Board leadership structure provides the appropriate balance of independent directors and management directors. We have a traditional board leadership structure under which Mr. McGarry serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. A combined position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is only one element of our leadership structure, which also includes an independent Lead Director and active, independent non-employee directors. We currently have 11 non-employee directors, each of whom is independent. Our Board has four standing committees, each of which is comprised solely of independent directors with an independent committee chair. The Board has determined that the appropriate structure for the Board at this time is for Mr. McGarry, our Chief Executive Officer, to serve as Chairman of the Board, while also providing for the counterbalance of a strong independent Lead Director role, fully independent Board committees, and other good governance practices. The Board believes that Mr. McGarry is the best person to serve as Chairman because he is the director most familiar with our business and industry and the director most capable of identifying strategic priorities and executing our ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 25 ​ Table of Contents business strategy. The Board believes the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer serves as a highly effective bridge between the Board and management and provides the leadership to execute our business strategy and create shareholder value. In addition, having one person serve as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer demonstrates to our employees, suppliers, customers, shareholders and other stakeholders that PPG has strong leadership setting the tone and having the responsibility for managing our operations. Having a single leader eliminates the potential for confusion and provides clear leadership for PPG. Our Board consists of directors with significant leadership skills, as discussed above. All of our independent directors have served as the chairman, chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer or group president of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that our independent directors have demonstrated leadership in large enterprises and are well versed in board processes and that having directors with significant leadership skills benefits our Company and our shareholders. In accordance with our Bylaws and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Chairman is responsible for chairing Board meetings and setting the agenda for these meetings. Each director also may suggest items for inclusion on the agenda and may raise at any Board meeting subjects that are not on the agenda for that meeting. As required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our independent directors meet separately, without management present, at each meeting of the Board. In addition, each of the Board’s standing committees regularly meets without members of management present. The Board has designated the chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee to serve as the Lead Director. In their discretion, the independent directors may select another independent director to serve as the Lead Director. Aside from chairing meetings of the independent directors, the Lead Director: ● presides at all meetings where the Chairman is not present; ● facilitates communications and serves as a liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; ● has the power to call meetings of the independent directors; ● communicates to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer any suggestions, views or concerns expressed by the independent directors and consults with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer about the concerns of the Board; ● advises the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as to the information necessary or appropriate for the independent directors to effectively and responsibly perform their duties and provide feedback on the quality, quantity and timeliness of information submitted by management; ● approves Board meeting agendas and other types of information sent to the Board; ● approves meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; ● is available for consultation and direct communication with major shareholders as appropriate; ● participates in the identification and evaluation of director candidates and facilitates director development; ● acts as a resource and advisor to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; ● unless otherwise directed by the Board, serves as the independent directors’ representative in extraordinary matters such as significant corporate transactions and crisis situations; ● recommends to the Board the formation and membership of ad-hoc committees of the Board to oversee extraordinary matters such as significant corporate transactions and crisis situations; ● authorizes the retention of outside advisors and consultants who report directly to the Board on Board-wide issues; ● actively participates in the Board’s review of acquisition opportunities and the management succession process; and ● performs such other duties as the Board may from time to time designate. As part of its annual self-evaluation process, the Board, at least annually, evaluates our leadership structure to ensure that it provides the optimal structure for PPG. We believe that having a director with day-to-day oversight of Company operations, coupled with experienced independent directors who have appointed a Lead Director and four wholly-independent board committees, is the appropriate leadership structure for PPG. ​ ​ ​ ​ 26 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Shareholder Engagement ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Through engagement with our shareholders, the Board and our senior management team are provided with feedback on a variety of topics, including: ● strategic and financial performance ● operations ● corporate governance ● executive compensation ● Board composition ● environmental and social topics ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Percentage of our outstanding shares held by active, institutional investors with whom we met in 2021. ​ ​ Percentage of our outstanding shares held by institutional investors with whom we held governance-focused meetings in 2021. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ These constructive engagements enable the Board and management to evaluate and assess our Company from different perspectives and viewpoints. Our Lead Director, Hugh Grant, participated in a number of these governance-focused meetings. The key themes of feedback received during our engagement meetings as well as efforts we are taking in consideration of the feedback we received were shared with the Board. These initiatives help to ensure that the Board is apprised of key trends and topics being considered by our shareholders. A general outline of our approach to shareholder engagement can be found below. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Before the Annual Meeting of Shareholders At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders After the Annual Meeting of Shareholders ● We reach out to investors to discuss key issues facing our Company and industry ● Together, the Board and senior management discuss shareholder feedback and determine if additional actions are required ● Management institutes changes as appropriate ​ Our shareholders: ● elect eligible nominees to join the Board of Directors ● vote on executive compensation ● vote on the ratification of our auditors ● potentially vote on other proposals brought by management or by our shareholders ​ ● We tabulate and review the voting results ● Together, the Board and senior management discuss the results and determine what additional actions are appropriate ● We prepare our agenda for further shareholder engagement The Board’s Role in ESG Our Board is actively engaged in our ESG programs and initiatives. Our ESG approach is grounded in our vision of delivering lasting value for stakeholders and customers by operating with integrity, working safely, respecting the contributions of our people, preserving the environment and supporting the communities where we operate. Our ESG oversight structure is designed to effectively govern and manage the ESG risks and opportunities that are integral to our business strategy, and Board oversight of significant ESG matters is incorporated into its oversight of our business and our strategy. Significant ESG risks are reviewed and evaluated by the Board and its committees as part of their ongoing risk oversight of our Company. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 27 ​ Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Framework for Board oversight of ESG ​ Environmental Social Governance ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Sustainability and Innovation Committee PPG Board of Directors Nominating and Governance Committee ​ ​ ​ Employee health and safety Environmental programs Product stewardship Remediation activities Sustainability programs and performance Climate change risks and opportunities ​ Corporate governance oversight Recommending new directors and executive officers Government affairs and political activities Shareholder engagement ESG program governance ​ ​ ​ ​ ESG strategy Succession planning Diversity, equity and inclusion Community engagement and charitable programs ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee ​ Audit Committee ​ ​ ​ ​ Culture and purpose Employee engagement Employee development Executive compensation Pay equity ​ Enterprise risk management Cybersecurity Data privacy ​ ​ ​ ​ In 2021, the Board conducted a comprehensive review of its oversight of the Company’s ESG programs and practices to ensure that the Board or one of its committees has oversight responsibility for each of the ESG programs and practices that is significant to PPG. As a result of this review, the Board in 2021 revised our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charters of each committee to more clearly specify the ESG programs and practices overseen by the Board and each of its committees. The Nominating and Governance Committee actively monitors the changing ESG landscape and recommends changes to PPG’s governance programs and practices. The Board’s long-standing Sustainability and Innovation Committee (formerly known as the Technology and Environment Committee) oversees and receives regular updates on the Company’s environment, health and safety, product stewardship and sustainability initiatives, including the Company’s sustainability goals and progress toward our goals. In connection with its review of our ESG oversight program, the Board selected the Sustainability and Innovation Committee as the committee with responsibility for reviewing the risks and opportunities to PPG of the effects of climate change. PPG recognizes the importance of corporate culture and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to our success. The Board has been focused on employee engagement and provided its guidance in connection with the formulation and introduction of The PPG Way. Since the introduction of The PPG Way, the Board has received regular updates on our engagement progress. The Board has also endorsed our recent diversity, equity and inclusion actions, including hiring an executive level Global Head of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in 2020, the publication of our first Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report in early 2022 and the PPG Foundation’s commitment to organizations focusing on social justice. In 2021, the Board repositioned the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee as the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee and expanded its responsibilities to include oversight of our human capital strategies in the areas of culture and purpose, employee engagement, development and pay equity. Our aim is to bring color and brightness to communities around the world. The PPG Foundation is the primary vehicle for our U.S. community engagement efforts. The PPG Foundation distributes over $6 million in donations annually and manages our COLORFUL COMMUNITIES ® program. The Board has oversight responsibility for the PPG Foundation and also receives updates on PPG’s other community engagement and global giving initiatives. PPG engages in the political process when we believe that doing so will serve the best interests of the Company and our stakeholders. We support public policies that contribute to the achievement of our long-term growth. The Nominating and Governance Committee has been assigned responsibility to oversee our government affairs activities and to receive periodic reports regarding the activities of our Government Affairs team. More information about PPG’s ​ ​ ​ 28 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents political activities, including PPG’s Political Contributions and Activities Policy and political spending reports, are available on our Government Affairs website at http://corporate.ppg.com/Our-Company/Government-Affairs.aspx. Each Board committee will report its activities in these areas back to the full Board of Directors. At the management level, day-to-day implementation of our ESG initiatives is led by our Vice President, Global Sustainability, a new position created in 2021 to coordinate PPG’s ESG and sustainability programs and to communicate our ESG progress with our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. The Vice President, Global Sustainability works with PPG’s Sustainability Committee, a committee of management consisting of senior corporate executives, to establish and monitor our sustainability goals, policies, programs and procedures that incorporate sustainability into our business practices, including resource management, climate change impacts, innovation, communications, community engagement, procurement, manufacturing and employee wellness. Board Oversight of PPG’s Strategy PPG’s Board is actively engaged in developing and overseeing the execution of our strategy, including major business and organizational initiatives, capital allocation priorities and potential business development opportunities. Throughout the year, the Board applies its experience in manufacturing, global business, science and technology and marketing to oversee the execution of our strategy and capital allocation and works with senior management to guide our strategy. At its October meeting, the Board devotes one full day to reviewing and formulating our strategy. At each Board meeting and during our annual strategy session, directors engage with PPG’s senior leadership in robust discussions about the Company’s overall strategy, priorities for its businesses and long-term growth opportunities. The Board’s Role in Risk Management Management Our management team, led by the Enterprise Risk Committee, is responsible for the day-to-day management of risk. Board of Directors Our Board has broad oversight responsibility for our risk-management programs. While the Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing our enterprise risk assessment and management process, our entire Board is actively involved in overseeing risk management for the Company by engaging in periodic discussions with Company officers and other employees as the Board may deem appropriate. We believe that the leadership structure of our Board supports the Board’s effective oversight of the Company’s risk management. ​ ​ ​ Audit Committee Focuses on risks inherent in our accounting, financial reporting, legal and regulatory compliance, cybersecurity, data privacy and internal controls. ​ Sustainability and Innovation Committee Considers risks related to our environment, health, safety, product stewardship, climate change and our sustainability programs. Reviews our approach to innovation, science and technology. ​ Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee Considers the risks that may be implicated by our executive compensation and human capital management programs. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 29 ​ Table of Contents ● ● ​ Special Role of Audit Committee: ● In accordance with New York Stock Exchange requirements, our Audit Committee charter provides that the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our risk management process. ● The Audit Committee is updated on a regular basis on relevant and significant risk areas. This includes periodic updates from certain officers of the Company and a formal annual update by the Director, Corporate Audit Services (the leader of PPG’s internal audit function). The annual update provides a comprehensive review of PPG’s enterprise risks and includes the feedback from the Company’s officers and key managers. The Audit Committee, in turn, reports to the full Board. In 2021, we formed the Enterprise Risk Committee (“ERC”), a committee of management. The membership of the ERC includes the Executive Committee of the Company and the Director, Corporate Audit Services. The ERC has overall responsibility for PPG’s enterprise risk management processes. Its responsibilities include: ● developing and fostering PPG’s risk management culture; ● identifying and monitoring the risks to PPG; ● monitoring PPG’s risk management capabilities and crisis preparedness and recovery plans; ● reviewing the steps management has taken to monitor and control major risk exposures, including the Company’s risk assessment and risk management policies; and ● reviewing and assessing the effectiveness of PPG’s enterprise-wide risk assessment processes. The ERC provides updates on its key activities and PPG’s enterprise risk management programs and risk posture to the Board or its committees, as appropriate. Executive Succession Planning One of the Board’s primary responsibilities is to oversee the development of appropriate executive-level talent to successfully execute PPG’s strategy. Management succession is regularly discussed by the Board with Mr. McGarry and with PPG’s Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. The Board reviews candidates for all executive officer positions to confirm that qualified successor-candidates are available for all key positions and that development plans are being utilized to strengthen the skills and qualifications of successor-candidates. At least annually, as required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and typically more often, the Board’s discusses CEO succession planning. Mr. McGarry provides the Board with recommendations for and evaluations of potential CEO successors and reviews with the Board development plans for these successors. Directors engage with potential CEO and senior management talent at Board and committee meetings and in less formal settings to enable directors to personally interact with candidates. The Board reviews management succession in the ordinary course of business as well as contingency planning in the event of an emergency or unanticipated event. Corporate Governance Guidelines, Board Self-Evaluation and Board Orientation The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines are revised from time to time to better address particular needs as they change over time. The Board revised the Corporate Governance Guidelines in 2021 to clarify the ESG responsibilities of the Board of Directors. The Corporate Governance Guidelines may be accessed from the Corporate Governance section of our website at investor.ppg.com. The Board annually evaluates its own performance and that of its standing committees. The evaluation process is coordinated by the Nominating and Governance Committee and has three parts: committee self-assessments, full Board evaluations and evaluations of the individual directors in the class whose term is expiring at the next annual meeting. The committee self-assessments consider whether and how well each committee has performed the responsibilities listed in its charter. The full Board evaluations consider the committee self-assessments as well as the quality of the Board’s meeting agendas, materials and discussions. All assessments and evaluations focus on both strengths and opportunities for improvement and are shared with the Board. The Board has a program for orienting new directors which includes presentations from members of senior management regarding our operations, technologies, governance, finances, compensation programs and other topics of interest to our new directors. The Company also provides for continuing education for all directors, including the reimbursement of expenses for continuing education. ​ ​ ​ 30 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Director Resignation Policy Our Bylaws provide that if an incumbent director is not elected by majority vote in an “uncontested election” (where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected), the director must offer to tender their resignation to our Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee would then make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee’s recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date the election results are certified. The director who tenders their resignation will not participate in the Board’s decision with respect to their resignation. The election of directors that will be held at the 2022 Annual Meeting is an uncontested election. Review and Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons The Board and its Nominating and Governance Committee have adopted written policies and procedures relating to approval or ratification of “Related Person Transactions.” Under these policies and procedures, the Nominating and Governance Committee (or its chair, under some circumstances) reviews the relevant facts of all proposed Related Person Transactions and either approves or disapproves of the Related Person Transaction, by taking into account, among other factors it deems appropriate: ● The benefits to PPG of the transaction; ● The impact on a director’s independence, in the event the “Related Person” is a director or an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder or executive officer; ● The availability of other sources for comparable products or services; ● The terms of the transaction; and ● The terms available to unrelated third parties or to employees generally. No director may participate in any consideration or approval of a Related Person Transaction with respect to which they or any of their immediate family members is the Related Person. Related Person Transactions are approved only if they are determined to be in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of PPG and its shareholders. If a Related Person Transaction that has not been previously approved or previously ratified is discovered, the Nominating and Governance Committee, or its chair, will promptly consider all of the relevant facts. In addition, the committee generally reviews all ongoing Related Person Transactions on an annual basis to determine whether to continue, modify or terminate the Related Person Transaction. Under our policies and procedures, a “Related Person Transaction” is generally a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which PPG was, is or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any Related Person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. A “Related Person” is generally any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of PPG’s last fiscal year was, (i) a director or executive officer of PPG or a nominee to become a director of PPG; (ii) any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of PPG’s voting securities; or (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions As discussed above, the Nominating and Governance Committee is charged with reviewing potential conflicts of interest and all Related Person Transactions. PPG and its subsidiaries purchase products and services from and/or sell products and services to companies of which certain of the directors and/or executive officers of PPG are directors and/or executive officers. During 2021, PPG entered into the following transactions with Related Persons that are required to be reported under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission: Stephen F. Angel, a director of PPG, is Chairman of the Board of Linde plc. During 2021, PPG and its subsidiaries purchased approximately $3.3 million of industrial gases from Linde plc and sold approximately $127,000 of coatings products and services to Linde plc. John V.

Guillermo Novo, a director of PPG, is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ashland Global Holdings Inc. During 2021, PPG and its subsidiaries purchased approximately $19.2 million of products and services from Ashland Global Holdings Inc. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not consider the amounts involved in such transactions material. Such purchases from and sales to each company involved less than 1% of the consolidated gross revenues for 2021 of each of the purchaser and the seller and all of such transactions were in the ordinary course of business. Board Meetings and Committees The Board currently has four standing committees: Audit Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee, Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee and Sustainability and Innovation Committee. The current composition of each Board committee is indicated below. The charter of each Board committee is available on the Corporate Governance section of our website at investor.ppg.com. AUDIT COMMITTEE ​ Primary Role of this Committee: The primary role of the Audit Committee is to oversee and review on behalf of the Board of Directors PPG’s processes to provide for the reliability and integrity of the Company’s financial reporting, including the Company’s disclosure practices, risk management processes and internal controls.

The committee’s charter, which may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at investor.ppg.com, describes the composition, purposes and responsibilities of the committee. Among other things, the charter provides that the committee will be comprised of independent, non-employee directors. The functions of the committee are primarily to review with our independent auditors and our internal auditors their respective reports and recommendations concerning audit findings and the scope of and plans for their future audit programs and to review audits, annual and quarterly financial statements and accounting and financial controls. The committee also appoints our independent registered public accounting firm, oversees our internal audit department, assists the Board in oversight of our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to financial reporting matters and oversees the risk management process. The Board has determined that each member of the committee is “financially literate” in accordance with the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the Board has determined that all of the members of the committee, including Ms. Smith, the chair of the committee, are “audit committee financial experts” in accordance with the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Audit Committee Report to Shareholders The primary role of the Audit Committee is to oversee and review on behalf of the Board of Directors PPG’s processes to provide for the reliability and integrity of the Company’s financial reporting, including the Company’s disclosure practices, risk management processes and internal controls. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. ​ ​ ​ 32 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and PPG’s lead internal auditor, the Director of Corporate Audit Services. In addition, the Audit Committee led the appointment and retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as PPG’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2021. In 2021, the Audit Committee participated in the selection process for a new lead audit partner due to the required rotation of PPG’s current lead audit partner after completion of the 2022 audit. For the work performed on the 2021 audit, the Audit Committee discussed and evaluated PricewaterhouseCoopers’ performance, which included an evaluation by the Company’s management of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ performance. The Audit Committee is responsible for the compensation of the independent registered public accounting firm and has reviewed and approved in advance all services performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Audit Committee discussed with, and received regular status reports from, the Director of Corporate Audit Services and PricewaterhouseCoopers on the overall scope and plans for their audits, their plans for evaluating the effectiveness of PPG’s internal control over financial reporting and the coordination of efforts between them. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the key risk factors used in developing PPG’s internal audit and PricewaterhouseCoopers’ audit plans. The Audit Committee also reviewed with the Company’s management PPG’s risk management practices and an assessment of significant risks. The Audit Committee met separately with the Vice President and Controller, the Director, Corporate Audit Services and PricewaterhouseCoopers, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their audits of PPG’s financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and the overall quality of PPG’s financial reporting. The Audit Committee also met separately with the Company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and with the Company’s Senior Vice President and General Counsel. The Audit Committee annually reviews its performance and receives feedback on its performance from the Company’s management and PricewaterhouseCoopers, when appropriate. The Company’s management is responsible for the preparation and accuracy of PPG’s financial statements. The Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. In 2021, PPG’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, was responsible for auditing the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of PPG’s internal control over financial reporting. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with the Company’s management the process to assemble the financial statements, including the Company’s internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and management’s report on internal control over financial reporting with management and with PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Audit Committee also discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers the matters required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee has received the written independence disclosures and letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers its independence. In addition, the Audit Committee considered whether PricewaterhouseCoopers’ provision of non-audit services to PPG is compatible with maintaining its independence. Based upon these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee: Steven A. Davis Gary R. Heminger Kathlen A. Ligocki Michael T. Nally Guillermo Novo Catherine R.

The committee’s charter, which may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at investor.ppg.com, describes the composition, purposes and responsibilities of the committee. Among other things, the charter provides that the committee recommends to the Board actions to be taken regarding the structure, organization and functioning of the Board, and the persons to serve as members of the standing committees of, and other committees appointed by, the Board. The charter gives the committee the responsibility to develop and recommend corporate governance guidelines to the Board, to recommend to the Board the process and criteria to be used in evaluating the performance of the Board and to oversee the evaluation of the Board. Director Candidates The Nominating and Governance Committee considers recommendations of potential director candidates from current directors, management and shareholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee also has authority to retain and terminate search firms to assist in identifying director candidates. From time to time, search firms have been paid a fee to identify candidates. Director Candidate Attributes In evaluating director candidates, the committee looks for candidates having the skills that the Board believes would add to the capabilities and knowledge of our Board, including the skills and attributes set forth below: ● age shall be considered only in terms of experience of the candidate, seeking candidates who have broad experience in business, finance, leadership, technology, strategy, sustainability, government affairs or law; ● candidates for director should have knowledge of the global operations of industrial and retail businesses such as those of PPG; ​ ​ ​ ​ 34 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents ● candidates for director should be cognizant of PPG’s societal responsibilities in conducting its operations; ● each candidate should have sufficient time available to be a meaningful participant in Board affairs. Candidates should not be considered if there is either a legal impediment to service or a foreseeable conflict of interest which might materially hamper full and objective participation in all matters considered by the Board of Directors; ● absent unforeseen health problems, each candidate should be able to serve as director for a sufficient period of time to make a meaningful contribution to the Board’s guidance of PPG’s affairs; and ● the Board will be comprised of a majority of independent directors. In applying these criteria, the committee seeks to establish a Board that, when taken as a whole, should: ● be representative of the broad scope of shareholder interests, without orientation to any particular constituencies; ● challenge management, in a constructive way, to reach PPG’s goals and objectives; ● be sensitive to the diversity of PPG’s shareholders, associates, operations and other stakeholder interests; ● be comprised principally of active or retired senior executives of publicly held corporations or financial institutions, with consideration given to those individuals who are scientifically-oriented, educators and government officials having corporate experience, whenever the needs of PPG indicate such membership would be appropriate; ● include directors of varying ages, but whose overriding credentials reflect maturity, experience, insight and prominence in the community; and ● be small enough to promote open and meaningful boardroom discussion, but large enough to staff the necessary Board committees. Shareholder Recommendations or Nominations for Director and Proxy Access The Nominating and Governance Committee considers recommendations of potential candidates from shareholders. Candidates recommended by shareholders are evaluated against the same criteria used to evaluate all candidates. Shareholders wishing to recommend or nominate a nominee for director should send their recommendation or nomination to the corporate secretary at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272. PPG’s Bylaws provide for “proxy access.” Proxy access is a process that allows an eligible shareholder or a group of eligible shareholders to nominate director candidates to appear in PPG’s proxy materials. Proxy access is available to shareholders or groups consisting of no more than 20 shareholders that have held at least 3% of PPG’s outstanding stock for at least three years and who have met the other requirements set forth in Article I of PPG’s Bylaws. A shareholder recommendation or nomination of a director candidate must be submitted by the deadlines and with the information and written representations that are described in Article I of our Bylaws. Director nominations submitted pursuant to PPG’s proxy access Bylaw for consideration at the 2023 Annual Meeting of shareholders must be received by PPG no earlier than October 11, 2022 and no later than November 10, 2022. A copy of PPG’s Bylaws may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at investor.ppg.com. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 35 ​ Table of Contents HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ​ Primary Role of this Committee: The primary role of the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee is to oversee the compensation of PPG’s executive officers and directors, to set objectives for incentive-based compensation for our executive officers and to oversee the Company’s human capital management strategies.

The committee’s charter, which may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at investor.ppg.com, describes the composition, purposes and responsibilities of the committee. Among other things, the charter provides that the committee will be comprised of independent, non-employee directors. The committee approves, adopts, administers, interprets, amends, suspends and terminates our compensation plans applicable to, and establishes the compensation and benefits of, all of our directors and executive officers. Recommendations regarding compensation of other officers are made by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The conclusions reached and recommendations based on these reviews, including with respect to salary adjustments and annual award amounts, are presented to the committee. The committee can exercise its discretion in modifying any recommended adjustments or awards to executives. Committee meetings are regularly attended by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, as well as a representative of the outside compensation consulting firm retained by the committee, FW Cook. At each meeting, the committee meets in executive session. The committee’s chair reports the committee’s recommendations on executive compensation to the Board.

As a part of the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee’s review, the types and levels of compensation offered to our non-employee directors are compared with those provided by a select group of comparable companies. Target total annual compensation for our directors is set at or near the market median using a comparator group of companies. The companies comprising this comparator group are used for review of the executive officer compensation program as well. The comparator group used in 2020 to set 2021 compensation was: ​ ​ ​ ​ 3M Company Eaton Corporation plc International Paper Company Textron Inc. ​ Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Ecolab Inc. ​ Johnson Controls International Plc The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Celanese Corporation Emerson Electric Co. Linde Plc The Sherwin-Williams Company Dow, Inc. Honeywell International Inc. Parker-Hannifin Corporation Trane Technologies Plc DuPont de Nemours, Inc. Howmet Aerospace Inc. ​ Rockwell Automation, Inc. ​ ​ Eastman Chemical Company Illinois Tool Works Inc. Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. ​ Taking into consideration the size of PPG relative to this comparator group and advice from FW Cook, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee reports its recommendations to the Board for approval. The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee does not determine director compensation, but only makes recommendations to the Board. Changes to the non-employee directors’ compensation program generally become effective as of the year following adoption.

For 2021, the annual retainer for service as a committee chair or as the Lead Director was as follows: $25,000 for the chair of the Audit Committee; $25,000 for the Lead Director; $20,000 for the chair of each of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee; and $15,000 for the chair of the Sustainability and Innovation Committee. (2) In April 2021, each director received 947 time-based restricted stock units, or RSUs. The RSUs will vest on April 20, 2022, and the grant date fair value of each RSU grant was $153.19. Dollar values represent the grant date fair value calculated ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 39 ​ Table of Contents in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) Topic 718. The assumptions made in calculating the grant date fair values are set forth in Note 13 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is located on pages 55 through 61 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2021, each director had 947 unvested RSUs. (3) Amounts in this column reflect donations made by the PPG Industries Foundation under our charitable awards program. The PPG Industries Foundation matches donations, up to $10,000 per year in most cases, made by a director in any one year. However, matching payments by the PPG Industries Foundation may be paid in a year subsequent to the donation depending on the timing of the director’s donation during the year and the timing of the PPG Industries Foundation's verification process. This may result in matching payments that exceed $10,000 in one year. For additional information regarding charitable awards, see "Charitable Awards Program." Annual Retainer For 2021, each of our non-employee directors received an annual retainer with a value equal to $280,000, of which $135,000 was paid in cash and $145,000 in equity in the form of time-based restricted stock units, or TBRSUs. The cash portion of the retainer was payable in quarterly installments, with the first quarterly installment paid after the annual meeting of shareholders. The number of TBRSUs a director received was determined by dividing $145,000 by the weighted average closing price of our stock on the grant date, which was the date of the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. A TBRSU represents the right to receive a share of PPG common stock upon vesting and earns dividend equivalents during the vesting period when dividends are declared on PPG common stock, but does not carry voting rights or other rights afforded to a holder of PPG common stock. TBRSUs granted in 2021 vest on the day prior to the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Beginning in 2022, the annual retainer will increase to $300,000, of which $135,000 will be paid in cash and $165,000 will be paid in equity in the form of TBRSUs. Additional Retainers for Committee Chairs and the Lead Director In addition to the annual retainer for each non-employee director, each non-employee director who chairs a Board standing committee is entitled to an additional annual cash retainer, which is payable at the same time as the regular annual retainer. The Lead Director also receives an additional cash retainer in recognition of the additional time and effort required by the role, including, among other responsibilities, planning Board meetings, meeting with management and engaging with our shareholders. The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee determined to increase the cash retainer to the Lead Director by $10,000 beginning in 2022 in recognition of the additional time and effort required by the Lead Director. For 2021, the additional annual retainers for service as a committee chair or as the Lead Director were: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ RETAINER COMMITTEE ​ AMOUNT Audit ​ $ 25,000 Lead Director ​ $ 25,000 Nominating and Governance ​ $ 20,000 Human Capital Management and Compensation ​ $ 20,000 Sustainability and Innovation ​ $ 15,000 Insurance Coverage We pay the premiums to provide each of our non-employee directors with the following insurance coverage: ● Accidental death and dismemberment insurance coverage, which provides $250,000 for accidental loss of life, and up to 100% of the death benefit for loss of limb. The aggregate cost to PPG of providing this coverage to non-employee directors for 2021 was $1,170. ● PPG aircraft travel insurance coverage, which provides up to a $1,000,000 per seat voluntary settlement allowance, for travel on a PPG-owned aircraft, and a reduced amount for travel on a PPG leased or chartered aircraft. The aggregate cost to PPG of providing this coverage to non-employee directors for 2021 was $17,105. Deferred Compensation A non-employee director may elect to have all or a portion of their retainer fees (including fees payable in TBRSUs) credited to the PPG Industries, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, thus deferring receipt of such fees until after the director leaves the Board. All amounts held in a director’s account under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited as hypothetical shares of our stock, or what we refer to as common stock equivalents, the number of which is ​ ​ ​ 40 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents determined by dividing the dollar amount of the deferral by the closing stock price of PPG common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of the deferral. Common stock equivalents earn dividend equivalents (that are converted into additional common stock equivalents) when dividends are declared on PPG common stock, but do not carry voting rights or other rights afforded to a holder of PPG common stock. Each non-employee director will generally be paid their deferred compensation account balance no earlier than six months and ten days after leaving the Board of Directors, except in circumstances of death or disability, in which case payment shall be made as soon as administratively possible. Each non-employee director’s account balance will be paid in a lump sum. All distributions are made in the form of one share of PPG common stock for each common stock equivalent credited to the director’s deferred account (and cash as to any fractional common stock equivalents). PPG Industries Foundation Matching Gifts Program All of our current directors are eligible to participate in the PPG Industries Foundation Matching Gifts Program, which encourages charitable donations by our directors by matching their contributions to eligible institutions. Contributions of up to a total of $10,000 per year, in most cases, may be matched under the program. Most charitable organizations are eligible for the Matching Gifts Program, with a few exceptions. Stock Ownership We established stock ownership guidelines for all non-employee directors effective January 1, 2005. Under the guidelines, each non-employee director is required to own shares of our stock with a value equal to five times the portion of the annual retainer that is paid in cash. For non-employee directors, unvested TBRSUs and common stock equivalent shares credited to the director under the Deferred Compensation Plan are counted toward meeting this requirement. Mss. Ligocki and Smith and Messrs. Nally and Novo are within their five-year compliance period and should meet the ownership requirement by the end of such period. All other non-employee directors have met or exceeded the ownership requirement. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 41 ​ Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ROADMAP ​ ​ ​ HOW DID WE PERFORM? ● Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.77, up about 11% versus prior year. ● Sales were up about 21%, driven by higher organic sales of about 10% and acquisition-related sales of about 9%. ● Returned approximately $750 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, including an increased annual per share dividend payout ● Generated about $1.6 billion in adjusted cash flow from operations, lower than 2020 due to higher absolute working capital as a result of increased sales and higher priced inventory due to raw material inflation. ● Completed several acquisitions, increasing both geographic and product scope. ● While our financial performance was strong, we did not achieve our adjusted cash flow from operations target.

This vision is enabled by a strategy of accelerated profitable growth and enhanced operational excellence. Our executive compensation program is a key factor in promoting this strategy and a crucial tool in aligning the interests of our senior leadership with those of our shareholders. ​ ​ ​ HOW DID WE PERFORM? In the following section, we discuss our performance in 2021 and how it affected the compensation of our named executive officers. The Company’s strong performance and focus on shareholder value is evident in our continuing legacy of outstanding cash generation and rewarding shareholders. PPG has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899 and has increased its annual dividend payout for 50 consecutive years. Continuing with that legacy, in 2021 PPG returned about $750 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. ● In 2021, the Company delivered record net sales despite the global COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing raw material and transportation availability challenges, which significantly impacted the Company’s 2021 performance and businesses. Organic sales were higher by 10%, including sales volume growth and higher selling prices. Total net sales from continuing operations for 2021 were approximately $16.8 billion, up about 21% compared to 2020. The Company’s 2021 full-year reported net income from continuing operations was $1.4 billion, or $5.93 per diluted share versus $1.1 billion, or $4.44 per diluted share, in 2020. Full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased about 11% year-over-year to a record $6.77 compared with $6.12 in 2020. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for 2021 was $1.62 billion, versus $1.45 billion in 2020. ● In 2021, the Company generated approximately $1.6 billion in adjusted cash flow from operations, which is lower than 2020 due to higher absolute working capital as a result of increased sales and higher priced inventory due to raw material inflation. ● Operating working capital as a percent of sales as of December 2021 was comparable to December 2020. ● Our business portfolio continued to demonstrate its resiliency with record full year net sales, up about 21% compared to the prior year. ● Selling prices increased nearly 5% compared to prior year. ● Sales volume growth increased over 5% compared to prior year. ● In September, the Company raised the per-share dividend by nearly 10%—paying approximately $540 million in dividends in 2021. The Company also repurchased $210 million of stock in 2021. ● In 2021, the Company completed four acquisitions, increasing both geographic and product scope. Cash spending for these acquisitions totaled approximately $2.1 billion. The collective annualized sales of these four acquisitions and the acquisition completed in late 2020 was about $1.7 billion. ● The Company achieved about $135 million in cost savings from restructuring cost programs. ● The Company’s stock price increased 20% during 2021 providing value to our shareholders. ​ ​ ​ 44 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents The following charts contain adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, net sales from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations as used for determining the compensation of our executive officers for each of the last five fiscal years: ​ ​ ​ Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share from Continuing Operations Net Sales (In Millions USD) Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations (In Millions USD) ​ *2017 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share include $15 million ($0.06) for the results of the North American fiber glass business through August 31, 2017, which has been recast as discontinued operations for all periods presented, but which is included in the compensation metric. These figures also include $20 million ($0.08) for the impact of raw materials and Puerto Rican business resulting from the 2017 natural disasters. **2019 Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share includes $0.16 for the year-over-year impact of foreign currency translation. *** Beginning in 2021, the Company reports adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding amortization expense relating to intangible assets from completed acquisitions. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2020 has been recast to exclude acquisition-related amortization expense. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for earnings per diluted share or net income or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the Company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. A Regulation G reconciliation of adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations to reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and net income from continuing operations is included in Annex A to this Proxy Statement. ● We had a solid performance in 2021. We achieved our 2021 targets for adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, price increase and sales volume growth. We did not achieve our adjusted cash flow from operating activities target. As a result, annual incentive awards were paid to executive officers ranged from 100% to 121% of target. Our total shareholder return over the past three years when measured against the S&P 500 was in the 56th percentile resulting in the payment of long-term TSR share awards at 92.8% of target. ● Between 74% and 90% of the named executive officers’ target total direct compensation opportunity for 2021 was in the form of performance-based variable compensation and long-term incentives motivating them to deliver strong business performance and create shareholder value. ● Base salary and annual incentive targets for our executive officers are established annually to maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions. Target total annual compensation for each position is set at or near the market median. ● PPG’s compensation programs are reviewed annually to identify any inherent material risks to PPG created by these programs. Based on the results of the 2021 review, we concluded that the design of our compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long-term value of PPG. ● ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 45 ​ Table of Contents ​ ​ HOW DO WE DETERMINE COMPENSATION? In the following section, we discuss our philosophy for compensating executives based on their performance as well as how we execute that philosophy through our compensation programs. ​ ​ ​ Executive compensation is based on our pay-for-performance philosophy, which emphasizes executive performance measures that correlate closely with the achievement of both shorter-term performance objectives and longer-term shareholder value creation. ​ ​ In keeping with our pay-for-performance philosophy, a substantial portion of our executives’ annual and long-term compensation is performance-based, with the payment being contingent on the achievement of performance goals. We believe the program strikes the appropriate balance between effectively incentivizing our executives based on performance and utilizing responsible, market competitive pay practices in order that our executives dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our shareholders. This balance is evidenced by the performance metrics described in the section above. Compensation Philosophy and Objectives PPG’s philosophy in establishing compensation policies for our executive officers is to align compensation with our strategic objectives, while concurrently providing competitive compensation that enables us to attract and retain top-quality executive talent. The primary objectives of our compensation policies for executive officers are to: ● Attract and retain executive officers by offering total compensation that is competitive with that offered by similarly situated companies and rewarding outstanding personal performance; ● Promote and reward the achievement of short-term objectives that our Board of Directors and management believe will lead to long-term growth in shareholder value; and ● Closely align the interests of executive officers with those of our shareholders by making long-term incentive compensation dependent upon the Company’s financial performance and total shareholder return. Annual Compensation Programs Our executive officers receive two forms of annual compensation—base salary and annual incentive awards—which together constitute an executive’s total annual compensation. Our executive officers also receive long-term incentives which together with total annual compensation constitute an executive’s total direct compensation. Please note that “total annual compensation” and “total direct compensation” as discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, differs from the “Total” compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table, which includes long-term incentive and other forms of compensation. The levels of base salary and annual incentive targets for our executive officers are established annually under a program intended to maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions. Target total annual compensation and target total direct compensation for each position is set at or near the “market value” for that position. To determine market value, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee considers compensation data based on a comparator group, as well as the most recently available data from nationally-recognized independent executive compensation surveys representing a cross section of general industrial companies. For purposes of establishing the 2021 executive compensation program, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee considered a competitive analysis of total direct compensation levels and compensation mixes for our executive officers, using information from: ● two general industry surveys in which management participates: the Aon Hewitt Associates 2020 TCM Executive Total Compensation Survey and the Willis Towers Watson 2020 U.S. General Industry Executive Database; and ​ ​ ​ 46 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents ● comparison company median data from a comparator group consisting of 22 companies. The comparator group used in 2020 to set 2021 compensation was: ​ ​ ​ ​ 3M Company Eaton Corporation plc International Paper Company Textron Inc. ​ Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Ecolab Inc. ​ Johnson Controls International Plc The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Celanese Corporation Emerson Electric Co. Linde Plc The Sherwin-Williams Company Dow, Inc. Honeywell International Inc. Parker-Hannifin Corporation Trane Technologies Plc DuPont de Nemours, Inc. Howmet Aerospace Inc. ​ Rockwell Automation, Inc. ​ ​ Eastman Chemical Company Illinois Tool Works Inc. Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. ​ Our comparator group is intended to be representative of the market in which we compete most directly for executive talent. The selection of companies comprising our comparator group is based on similarity in revenue size, lines of business, participation in global markets and market capitalization. The peer group is constructed to target PPG near the median of the composite ranking of the financial and operating metrics of the companies in the comparator group. The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee annually reviews this group of companies with our independent executive compensation consultant, FW Cook, to ensure that it remains an appropriate benchmark for us. We target the median levels of compensation to derive our market value by adjusting this compensation data to reflect differences in company revenues using regression analysis. The competitive analysis showed that the 2021 target total direct compensation for the Company’s named executive officers was on average positioned within the market median range, which we define as within 20% of the median. In addition, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee annually reviews a tally sheet of each executive officer’s compensation. Each tally sheet includes detailed data for each of the following compensation elements: ● Annual compensation: Information regarding base salary and annual incentive targets for the current year; ● Long-term incentive awards: Information regarding all equity-based awards, whether vested or unvested, including total pre-tax value to the executive and holdings relative to our stock ownership requirements; ● Benefits and perquisites: Line item summary showing the annualized cost to the Company of health and welfare benefits, life insurance and perquisites; ● Pension and deferred compensation: Annualized cost to the Company of pension plan benefits (qualified plan and non-qualified plan) and defined contribution plans (401(k) and deferred compensation); and ● Description and quantification of all compensation and benefits payable upon retirement, termination of employment or change in control. The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee reviews the information presented in the tally sheet to ensure that it is informed of the compensation and benefits each executive is receiving annually. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 47 ​ Table of Contents The charts below illustrate the allocation of the principal compensation components for our named executive officers for 2021. ​ ​ ​ CEO Target Compensation ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other Named Executive Officer Target Compensation ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ HOW DO WE ADDRESS RISK? In the following section, we outline strategies that we’ve developed to mitigate risks over the short and long term in consideration of regulatory requirements. Compensation Program Design Mitigates Risk Annually, PPG management undertakes a review of all of PPG’s compensation programs to identify any inherent material risks to PPG created by these programs. The framework used to identify any potential risks that could be incentivized by our compensation programs was developed with input from members of our human resources, finance, and legal functions and our independent executive compensation consultant, FW Cook. The effect of the global COVID-19 pandemic and any potential negative impact to the company’s compensation plans was also considered. Based on the results of the 2021 review, we concluded that the design of our compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long-term value of PPG. Features of our compensation programs and practices that mitigate risk include, among other things: (i) incentive plans that are appropriately weighted between short-term and long-term performance and cash and equity; (ii) long-term incentives ​ ​ ​ 48 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents that consist of a mix of stock options, performance-based restricted stock units and total shareholder return contingent shares, which provides for a balanced mix of performance measures; (iii) ranges of performance and multiple performance targets are utilized to determine incentive compensation payouts, rather than a single performance target that provides an “all or nothing” basis for compensation; (iv) maximum payouts are in place in our incentive compensation programs to limit excessive payments; (v) determination of incentive compensation payouts is subject to managerial approval and/or Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee discretion; and (vi) our executive officers are subject to a recoupment policy in the event of a financial restatement affecting their incentive compensation payout. In addition, the following design elements of our compensation program mitigate potential risks: ● Our officers are subject to stock ownership requirements, as discussed below. ● Our officers may not engage in transactions that are contrary to the interests of shareholders, such as “short sales,” “short sales against the box,” “put” and “call” options and hedging transactions designed to minimize an executive’s risk inherent in owning PPG stock. In addition, officers may not hold PPG stock in a margin account and may not pledge PPG stock as collateral for a loan. ● Executive officers are subject to a “clawback” policy that is designed to recoup incentive compensation when a financial restatement occurs and certain other conditions exist. ● We provide very limited perquisites to our executive officers. ● We do not provide tax gross-ups on perquisites to our named executive officers. Financial Restatement It is our policy that we will, to the extent permitted by governing law, seek recoupment of incentive compensation paid to any executive officer where: ● the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement; ● the executive officer is found to have engaged in fraud or misconduct that caused or partially caused the need for the restatement; and ● a lower payment would have been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results. In each such instance, we will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover the amount by which the individual executive officer’s incentive compensation for the relevant period exceeded the payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results, plus a reasonable rate of interest. PPG Stock Ownership Requirements The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee also believes that it is in the best interests of shareholders for our officers to own a significant amount of PPG common stock, thereby aligning their interests with the interests of shareholders. Accordingly, in 2003 the Human Capital Management Compensation Committee implemented stock ownership requirements applicable to all of our officers based on a multiple of base salary. The current stock ownership requirements are: ​ ​ ​ ​ Position ​ ​ Required Stock Ownership Chief Executive Officer 6 times base salary Other executive officers 3 times base salary Other officers 1 or 2 times base salary Ownership for purposes of these requirements includes shares of PPG common stock personally owned as well as all stock holdings in PPG’s savings plan and deferred compensation accounts and any unvested time-based restricted stock units. Unexercised options and unvested performance shares awarded under our long-term incentive plans are not counted for these purposes. Officers are expected to meet these ownership requirements within five years of election, appointment or promotion. Those officers who have not yet met this requirement are paid 20% of their annual incentive in PPG stock, which is restricted from sale for a period of two to five years. In addition, for officers who have been subject to the policy for more than five years at their current requirement level and have not met the ownership requirement, 100% of the vested shares delivered from the performance-based restricted stock unit (“PBRSU”) award ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 49 ​ Table of Contents and total shareholder return share award (“TSR”) must be held by the officer for a minimum of one year and until the requirement is met. All executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table have met their ownership requirement. Prohibition on Hedging and Pledging PPG Securities PPG officers and directors may not engage in any transaction in which they may profit from short-term speculative swings in the value of PPG’s securities. This prohibition includes “short sales” (selling borrowed securities that the seller hopes can be purchased at a lower price in the future) or “short sales against the box” (selling owned, but not delivered securities), “put” and “call” options (publicly available rights to sell or buy securities within a certain period of time at a specified price) and other hedging transactions designed to minimize an executive’s risk inherent in owning PPG stock, such as zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts. In addition, officers may not hold PPG stock in a margin account and may not pledge PPG stock as collateral for a loan. This policy is designed to discourage risk taking with PPG securities by officers and to ensure compliance with all insider trading rules. PPG employees who are not officers of the Company are not subject to these prohibitions. However, PPG’s Global Code of Ethics prohibits all PPG employees from buying or selling PPG stock or the stock of any other company while aware of material non-public information and prohibits employees from sharing material non-public information for financial or other personal benefit. Our Policies with Respect to the Granting of Equity Awards Equity awards may be granted by either the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee or its delegate. The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee only delegates authority to grant equity awards to employees who are not executive officers, and only in aggregate amounts not exceeding amounts approved by the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee. The Board generally does not grant equity awards, although the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee regularly reports its activity, including approval of grants, to the Board. Timing of Grants. Equity awards are granted in February at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee, and generally further grants are not made for the remainder of the year. These meetings occur approximately one month after the release of our earnings for the immediately preceding year. On limited occasions, grants may occur on an interim basis, primarily for the purpose of approving a compensation package for a newly hired or promoted executive officer. The timing of these grants is driven solely by the activity related to the need for the hiring or promotion, not our stock price or the timing of any release of Company information. Option Exercise Price. The exercise price of a newly granted stock option is the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. With respect to the occasional interim grants to a newly hired or promoted executive, the exercise price is the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, which is the later of the approval date or the hire or promotion date; provided, however, that if the date of hire or promotion would fall within a Company imposed blackout period, the grant date will be the first business day following such blackout period. Change In Control Agreements We have agreements in place with each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table providing for their continued employment for a period of up to three years in the event of an actual or threatened change in control of PPG (as “change in control” is defined in the agreements). We believe that these agreements serve to maintain the focus of our senior executives and ensure that their attention, efforts and commitment are aligned with maximizing the success of PPG and shareholder value. These agreements avoid distractions involving executive management that arise when the Board is considering possible strategic transactions involving a change in control and assure continuity of executive management and objective input to the Board when it is considering any strategic transaction. For additional information concerning our change in control agreements, see “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control.” Regulatory Considerations The tax and accounting consequences of utilizing various forms of compensation are considered when adopting new or modifying existing compensation programs. For example, we considered limitations on the deductibility of personal use of corporate aircraft under the American Jobs Creation Act when adopting our policies regarding use of our aircraft by executive officers. In addition, we have administered our incentive and equity compensation programs, severance plans and change in control agreements in compliance with federal tax rules affecting non-qualified deferred compensation. ​ ​ ​ 50 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the deductibility of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to any one named executive officer during any fiscal year. Under the rules in effect before 2018, compensation that qualified as “performance-based” under Section 162(m) was deductible without regard to this $1 million limit. To maintain flexibility in compensating executives in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee did not adopt a policy requiring all compensation to be deductible under Section 162(m) and continues to reserve the right to structure compensation arrangements and issue awards that may not be deductible under Section 162(m). However, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee historically has considered, among other factors, deductibility under Section 162(m) with respect to compensation arrangements for executives. Prior to 2018, we generally designed our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs for executives in a manner that was intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), with the understanding that these programs may not qualify from time to time. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law December 22, 2017, eliminated the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m), effective January 1, 2018, subject to a special rule that “grandfathers” certain awards and arrangements that were in effect on or before November 2, 2017. As a result, compensation that our Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee structured in 2017 and prior years with the intent of qualifying as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) that is paid on or after January 1, 2018 may not be fully deductible, depending on the application of the special grandfather rules. Moreover, from and after January 1, 2018, compensation awarded in excess of $1,000,000 to our named executive officers, including our chief financial officer, generally will not be deductible. While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will limit the deductibility of compensation paid to our named executive officers, our Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee will, consistent with its past practice, continue to retain flexibility to design compensation programs that are in the best long-term interests of PPG and our shareholders, with deductibility of compensation being one of a variety of considerations taken into account. We continue to analyze whether to redesign any of our compensation programs in light of the amendments to Section 162(m) and other sections of the Internal Revenue Code that became effective in 2018. ​ ​ ​ ​ HOW DO WE PAY OUR EXECUTIVES? In this section, we describe the components of the total compensation package for our executives and how these components align with our greater pay-for-performance philosophy. Principal Components of Executive Compensation The principal components of our executive compensation program are: ​ ​ ​ COMPENSATION COMPONENT OVERVIEW OBJECTIVES Base Salary Fixed compensation that is established annually Maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions Annual Incentive Awards Variable compensation that is based on Company, business, and individual performance Incentivize executive officers to achieve our short-term performance objectives Long-Term, Equity-Based Incentives Variable compensation that is based solely on Company performance Retain our executive officers, align their financial interests with the interests of shareholders, and incentivize achievement of our long-term strategic goals Mix of Compensation Components Executive compensation is based on our pay-for-performance philosophy, which emphasizes executive performance measures that correlate closely with the achievement of both shorter-term performance objectives and longer-term shareholder value creation. To this end, a substantial portion of our executives’ annual and long-term compensation is performance-based, with the payment being contingent on the achievement of performance goals. The portion of compensation that is performance-based increases with the executive’s level of responsibility. We use performance- based compensation for more senior positions because these roles have greater leadership responsibility and influence on the performance of the Company as a whole. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 51 ​ Table of Contents Annual Compensation Our annual compensation policies reflect our pay-for-performance philosophy. We set target total annual compensation for our executive officers to be competitive with the market value for comparable positions, taking into account each executive’s experience in the position and performance. Annual incentive awards are targeted at a level that, when combined with base salaries, is intended to yield total annual compensation that approximates market value. As a result, total annual compensation for a position generally should exceed its market value when our financial performance exceeds our applicable annual targets and individual performance contributes to meeting our objectives. Total annual compensation generally should be below market value when our financial performance does not meet targets and/or individual performance does not have a favorable impact on our objectives. Base Salary. Based on the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee’s review of the applicable compensation data as discussed above, in February 2021 the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee set base salaries effective March 1, 2021 for all executive officers in relation to the market value for comparable positions. Mr. Morales and Ms. Foulkes each received a base salary increase of $20,000. Mr. McGarry, Ms. Liebert and Mr. Knavish did not receive a base salary increase in 2021. Annual Incentive Awards. In February 2021, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee established annual incentive awards primarily based on target levels set for each executive officer and pre-established, short-term performance objectives. On an annual basis, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee establishes a target annual incentive award for each executive officer based on the executive’s position and the market value of comparable positions in our comparator group. For 2021, this target, when expressed as a percentage of base salary, was as follows for each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. McGarry, 150%; Mr. Morales, 90%; Ms. Liebert, 80%; Mr. Knavish, 80%; and Ms. Foulkes, 80%. The amount of an executive’s actual annual incentive award, in relation to the executive’s target opportunity, is determined on the basis of achievement of short-term performance objectives. The performance objectives for our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Senior Vice President and General Counsel include specific financial targets for Company performance (weighted 80%) and personal performance (weighted 20%). The performance objectives for our other executive officers include specific financial targets for Company performance (weighted 50%), business performance (weighted 30%) and personal performance (weighted 20%). For many years, PPG has been committed to sustainability. Recognizing the importance of sustainability and its ability to drive innovation in our business, PPG includes sustainability goals in the performance goals of its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Performance against these goals is reviewed by the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Annual incentive compensation of PPG’s executives and senior managers is partially (20%) based on personal goals that tie to overall corporate business goals, with the remainder based on company and business financial performance. Depending on their role, some executives and senior managers, by virtue of their responsibilities, may have goals related to social or environmental performance. In addition, executive business unit leaders receive sustainability scorecards for their business unit, and they are responsible for driving improvement in their business unit’s sustainability metrics. Safety, waste costs, energy usage and costs, and sustainable product sales are part of these executives’ annual performance review. Beginning in 2022, our executive officers have ESG goals included in the individual performance component of their annual incentive award. Each executive officer has a specific DE&I goal and a sustainability or governance goal that is aligned with the Company’s strategies and targets. The potential payout of the Company performance component of the annual incentive is based on a pre-determined schedule recommended by management and approved by the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee. The schedule corresponds to various levels of potential Company financial performance measured by adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (weighted 60%), adjusted cash flow from operating activities (weighted 20%), price increase (weighted 10%) and sales volume growth (weighted 10%), assuming the minimum adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations threshold is met. The maximum payout of this component under the schedule is 220% of target. In assessing Company performance against objectives, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee considers reported results against the approved target objectives, taking into consideration whether significant uncontrollable and unforeseen events or economic obstacles or more favorable circumstances impacted the Company’s results. The assessment of Company performance determines the percentage of the target award that will be awarded to each executive for the Company performance component of the annual incentive award. For 2021, as described below, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee exercised discretion and approved certain non-operating adjustments to the 2021 reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, cash flow from operating activities – continuing operations results, price increase and sales volume growth, consistent with guidelines ​ ​ ​ 52 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents established previously by the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee. In the past, select adjustments have related to items such as legacy litigation or legacy environmental remediation, accounting rule changes and major business portfolio changes, including planned restructuring initiatives. In February 2021, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee approved a financial performance standard for the Company component of the award of $6.75 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $2,112 million, price increase of 1.50% and sales volume growth of 4.00%. If achieved, this standard would generate 100% of the target bonus for the Company component of the award. The approved performance standard for 2021 included a threshold adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $4.99, below which no bonus would be paid, regardless of the adjusted cash flow from operating activities, the sales increase or the sales volume growth results. The committee also set threshold cash flow from continuing operations performance of $1,315 million, a threshold price increase performance of 0.00% and a threshold sales volume growth performance of 0.00% for payment on those three components. In addition, the approved performance standard for 2021 included a maximum bonus opportunity of 220% if adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $7.54, adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $2,365 million, price increase of 2.25% and sales volume growth of 6.00% were achieved. ​ For 2021, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee approved the actual Company performance component for incentive awards based on adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $6.77, adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $1,649 million, price increase of 4.80% and sales volume growth of 5.10%. The earnings per diluted share performance component included adjustments of $0.55 for acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.29 for acquisition-related costs, $0.15 for a pension settlement charge, $0.11 for environmental remediation charges, $0.09 for a net tax charge related to a United Kingdom statutory rate change, $0.08 for business restructuring-related costs, net, $0.06 for expenses incurred due to natural disasters and $0.05 for impairment charges. These charges were offset by a $0.05 gain for the change to the allowance for doubtful accounts related to COVID-19, a $0.07 gain from legal settlements and a $0.42 gain for an adjustment of the asbestos-related claims reserve. Adjustments to the cash flow from operating activities performance component included adding back $77 million for restructuring cash spending and $10 million for cash contributions to pension plans. ​ Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $6.77, adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $1,649 million, price increase of 4.80% and sales volume growth of 5.10% resulted in a payout of 108% of target for the Company performance component, based on the schedule discussed above. For the adjusted earnings per diluted share component, this schedule yielded a payout of 100% for the result of $6.77 per share. For the adjusted cash flow component, this schedule yielded a payout of 45% for the result of $1,649 million. For the price increase component, the schedule yielded a payout of 220% for the result of 4.80%. For the sales volume growth component, this schedule yielded a payout of 166% for the result of 5.10%. Combining these four results using the 60%, 20%, 10% and 10% weightings, respectively, yielded an overall result of 108%, which was approved by the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee.

The personal performance assessment of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is determined by the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee with input from the other non-management members of the Board. The personal performance of each other executive officer is determined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The following factors were considered in assessing the personal performance of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table for 2021 against individual objectives: Under Mr. McGarry’s leadership, the Company delivered record net sales despite the global COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing raw material and transportation availability challenges, which significantly impacted the Company’s 2021 performance and financial results. Total net sales from continuing operations for 2021 were approximately $16.8 billion, up about 21% compared to 2020. The Company’s 2021 full-year reported net income from continuing operations was $1.4 billion, or $5.93 per diluted share versus $1.1 billion, or $4.44 per diluted share, in 2020. Full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased about 11% year-over-year to record $6.77 compared with $6.12 in 2020. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for 2021 was $1.62 billion, versus $1.45 billion in 2020. Despite the pandemic, sales volumes were up about 5% in 2021 over 2020. During 2021, supply disruptions, severe cost inflation, and lingering impacts from COVID-19 significantly impacted net sales and earnings and the Company’s ability to meet robust aggregate customer demand. There was some recovery in end-use markets that were significantly impacted by mobility restrictions in 2020, such as automotive refinish coatings and aerospace coatings, but both remained well below 2019 global demand levels. Demand for architectural products was mixed as the do-it-yourself channel gradually declined to pre-pandemic levels. This was partially offset by a strong recovery in do-it-for-me activity as demand for professional paint contractors improved from lower levels in 2020, supported by a strong U.S. housing market. A significant shortage of semiconductor chips developed as the year progressed which constrained automotive original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) production, despite strong underlying demand in many regions. Raw material cost inflation trended higher throughout the year, finishing the fourth quarter about 30% above the prior year fourth quarter. Some other key costs continued to increase in 2021 such as logistics, energy and employee wages and benefits. The Company took swift action to collaborate with its customers to increase selling prices to help mitigate the elevated input costs which drove a 5% increase in selling prices compared to 2020. The Company benefited from five strategic acquisitions that were completed between December 2020 and June 2021. The Company continued to make significant strides in its sustainability performance with serious injuries down 7% and spills and releases down nearly 3%. The Company made progress on establishing Science-Based Targets for its sustainability goals, and the Company named its first Vice President of Global Sustainability. The Company continued to strengthen its focus on diversity, equity and inclusion in 2021 through the expansion of the Company’s Employee Resource Networks by further empowering three existing networks and launching five additional networks for increased representation. Finally, employee engagement increased for the sixth year in a row. These results exceeded expectations. Mr. Morales led the finance organization to deliver very effective results. In 2021, the Company generated cash from adjusted operations of $1.6 billion, which was lower than 2020 due to higher absolute working capital as a result of increased sales and higher priced inventory due to raw material inflation. Working capital as a percent of sales as of December 2021 was comparable to December 2020. Mr. Morales led the Company’s efforts to contain costs, delivering more than $150 million in cost savings and to return capital to our shareholders through $210 million of share repurchases and approximately $540 million of dividends in 2021. In addition, he provided guidance over the signing, financing, completion and integration of several acquisitions. He also continued to lead efforts to streamline the finance function by centralizing operations, implementing new tools and processes. Mr. Morales performed effectively as a member of the Executive Committee, positively influencing the results of the Company. These results exceeded expectations. ​ ​ ​ 54 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Ms. Liebert led the automotive OEM coatings business, the industrial coatings business and the Asia Pacific region. In addition, beginning in March, Ms. Liebert led the packaging coatings and specialty coatings and materials businesses. Under Ms. Liebert’s leadership, automotive OEM coatings sales volumes increased by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, with declines in the second half of the year. During the year, production disruptions worsened at many automotive OEM customers due to semiconductor chip shortages. In the U.S., automotive OEM dealer inventories remained at historically low levels as consumer demand remained very robust while production levels were constrained. For the industrial coatings business, organic sales increased by a high-teen-percentage year-over-year as global industrial production continued to improve in most regions. Selling prices and sales volumes were higher in all regions versus prior year, with growth led by the appliance and heavy-duty equipment sub-segments. Packaging coatings organic sales increased by a high-teen-percentage year-over-year due to sales volume growth, including strong growth across the canned beverage segment partially offset by softening demand for the canned food segment compared to elevated levels in the prior year. Specialty coatings and materials net sales increased by about 35% versus the prior year, driven by higher sales volumes in the U.S. and Europe. She provided leadership to her staff responsibilities for our corporate strategy, mobility initiatives and the global procurement organization, which was successful in managing global raw material supply during the year despite ongoing constraints. In addition, she provided guidance over the signing and completion of several acquisitions and successfully led the integration of the recent acquisitions of Worwag and Cetelon. Ms. Liebert performed effectively as a member of the Executive Committee, positively influencing the results of the Company. These results met expectations. Mr. Knavish led the architectural coatings business for the United States and Canada, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific regions. He also oversaw the automotive refinish coatings business, the traffic solutions business and the Latin America region. In addition, beginning in March, Mr. Knavish led the architectural coatings business for the Latin America region. Under Mr. Knavish’s leadership architectural coatings - Americas and Asia Pacific net sales increased a mid-single-digit percentage during the year. Despite a strong first quarter, the remaining nine months of the year were negatively impacted by raw material shortages. In Mexico, the architectural coatings business’ organic sales increased by about 10% compared to prior year as the concessionaire network sell-out of PPG products continued to be strong. Architectural coatings EMEA net sales increased about 25% versus prior year largely driven by acquisition-related sales from Tikkurila and higher selling prices. Sales volumes were strong in the first half of the year but were negatively impacted by raw material shortages in the second half. Net sales for automotive refinish coatings increased over 20%, with significant growth in each region versus prior year driven by an increase in global miles driven and traffic density in most of the world coupled with higher selling prices. In addition, he provided guidance over the signing and completion of the Tikkurila acquisition and successfully led the integration of Ennis-Flint and Tikkurila. Mr. Knavish provided leadership to his staff responsibilities for the digital function and information technology organization, increasing digital sales over 2020. Mr. Knavish performed effectively as a member of the Executive Committee, positively influencing the results of the Company. These results exceeded expectations. Ms. Foulkes led the legal organization and was instrumental in successfully completing a number of acquisitions during the year. She was successful in navigating the continuing legal challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. Engagement scores for the Law Department were again the highest in the Company. Ms. Foulkes also led efforts to lower legal costs during the year. She has also expertly managed external litigation and environmental concerns globally for the Company. Ms. Foulkes performed effectively as a member of the Executive Committee, positively influencing the results of the Company. These results exceeded expectations. Business unit short-term performance objectives and their assessment are specific to each particular business and are based on earnings before taxes and interest, working capital reduction, price increase and sales volume growth. The overall assessment of business performance determines the percent of target paid to applicable executives for the business component of the annual incentive award. For 2021, we assessed the performance of 12 defined businesses against the criteria discussed above. Actual payouts of the business performance component ranged from 40% to 220% of target. The business performance component payouts for two of our executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table, Ms. Liebert and Mr. Knavish, are based on the performance of each of the specific businesses and regions for which each of them is responsible. Ms. Liebert’s business performance component was a composite of the results of the automotive OEM coatings business, the industrial coatings business and the Asia Pacific region. In addition, for the period March through December, Ms. Liebert’s business performance component included the composite of the results of the packaging coatings and the specialty coatings and materials businesses. The composite performance of these businesses were slightly below the performance objectives for earnings before interest and taxes, working capital performance, and sales volume growth, whereas price increase exceeded the target. This resulted in achieving 80% of target for this component. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 55 ​ Table of Contents Mr. Knavish’s business performance component was a composite of the results of the architectural coatings businesses for the USCA, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions; the automotive refinish coatings business; the traffic solutions business; and the Latin America region. In addition, for the period March through December, Mr. Knavish’s business performance component included the composite of the results of the architectural coatings business for the Latin America region. The composite performance of these businesses exceeded the performance objectives for earnings before interest and taxes, price increase and sales volume growth, whereas working capital performance was below target. This resulted in achieving 130% of target for this component. The level of achievement of corporate and personal performance objectives for 2021 for Messrs. McGarry and Morales and Ms. Foulkes corresponded to payouts of 115%, 114% and 114% of target, respectively. The level of achievement of business, corporate and personal performance objectives for 2021 for Ms. Liebert and Mr. Knavish corresponded to payouts of 100% and 121% of target, respectively. The annual incentive awards actually paid to each of these executives for 2021 are shown in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table. Annual incentive awards for these executive officers have ranged from 84% to 121% of target. Annual incentive awards are payable in cash, except that any executive who does not meet the stock ownership requirements described under “PPG Stock Ownership Requirements” receives 20% of their annual incentive award in the form of PPG common stock. Such stock is restricted from sale by such executive for a period of between two and five years, depending upon the level of stock ownership of the executive. In addition, for officers who have been subject to the policy for more than five years at their current requirement level and have not met the ownership requirement, 100% of the vested shares delivered from the PBRSU award and TSR share award must be held by the officer for a minimum of one year and until the requirement is met. U.S.-based participants are entitled to defer part or all of an annual incentive award under our deferred compensation plan. All executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table have met their stock ownership requirement. For additional information concerning our deferred compensation plan, see “Deferred Compensation Opportunities.” Long-Term Incentive Compensation Our Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee believes that long-term incentive compensation is an important component of our program because it has the effect of retaining executives, aligning executives’ financial interests with the interests of shareholders and incentivizing achievement of PPG’s long-term strategic goals. Payment of long-term incentive awards is based solely on Company performance. Grants are targeted at levels that approximate market value for comparable positions, utilizing the same compensation data used for setting total annual compensation. Each February, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee reviews and approves equity-based compensation for that year to be granted to executive officers. Three types of long-term incentive awards are granted annually to executive officers: ● Stock options; ● Total Shareholder Return contingent shares, or TSR shares; and ● Performance-based Restricted Stock Units, or PBRSUs. The number of stock options, TSR shares and PBRSUs granted to executive officers is intended to represent an estimated potential value that, when combined with total annual compensation, as discussed above, will approximate the market value of total annual and long-term compensation paid to executives in our comparator group and in a cross-section of general industrial companies represented in nationally-recognized executive compensation surveys. These types of long-term incentive awards were selected to provide a program that focuses on different aspects of long-term performance: stock price appreciation, total return to shareholders and earnings per share growth and cash flow return on capital. The estimated potential value of the awards granted to each executive officer is delivered equally through each instrument, so that approximately one-third of the value of the total award is in stock options, one-third is in performance-based RSUs, and one-third is in TSR shares. The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee selected equal distribution to emphasize its view that each of the three equity-based vehicles serves a particular purpose and is equally important in supporting our long-term compensation strategy. Stock Options. Stock options provide our executive officers with the opportunity to purchase and maintain an equity interest in PPG and to share in the appreciation of the value of our stock. All stock options granted to executive officers in 2021 were granted from our shareholder-approved Omnibus Incentive Plan. Some features of our stock option program include: ● Options become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant; ​ ​ ​ 56 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents ● The term of each grant does not exceed ten years; ● The exercise price is equal to the closing market price on the date of grant (we do not backdate or grant discounted stock options); ● We do not grant options with “reload” or “restored” provisions; and ● Repricing of stock options is prohibited. We continue to use stock options as a long-term incentive because stock options focus the management team on delivering levels of company financial performance over a longer term that contribute to shareholder value. For additional information concerning the timing of grants of stock options, see “Our Policies with Respect to the Granting of Equity Awards.” In February 2021, the following stock options were awarded to each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. McGarry, 107,049; Mr. Morales, 26,193; Ms. Liebert, 19,929; Mr. Knavish, 19,929; and Ms. Foulkes, 12,527. Such awards are consistent with our program to distribute long-term incentive awards equally among three different equity-based vehicles, as discussed above. TSR Shares. TSR shares represent a contingent share grant that is made at the beginning of a three-calendar-year performance period and vests on the last day of the performance period. The grant is settled in a combination of cash and shares of PPG common stock at the end of the performance period. The award amount generated by the grant is based on PPG’s total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 comparison group. This comparison group represents the entire S&P 500 Index as it existed at the beginning of the performance period, excluding any companies that have been removed from the Index because they ceased to be publicly traded during the performance period. The calculation of total shareholder return assumes that all dividends were reinvested. Summarized below are the material provisions of the TSR share program: ​ ​ ​ BASIS OF PAYOUT PERFORMANCE PERIOD VESTING AND PAYOUT OF BENEFIT • Total shareholder return of PPG compared to total shareholder return for S&P 500 companies (as described above) ​ • Payout is 0% to 220% of original TSR shares awarded: 3 calendar years • Vest on last day of performance period ​ • Settled in a combination of cash and shares at end of performance period ​ • Dividend equivalents are awarded at the end of the performance period, based on the actual number of shares earned and paid ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ PPG TSR GRANT PAYOUT 90 th percentile 220 % 80 th percentile 180 % 70 th percentile 140 % 60 th percentile 100 % 50 th percentile 80 % 40 th percentile 50 % 30 th percentile 30 % Below — % If minimum performance is not achieved, no payment is made with respect to the TSR share grant. If performance is above target, payment may exceed the original number of contingent TSR shares awarded. Target performance is set at the 60th percentile rank. The minimum and maximum number of shares that may be issued upon settlement of a TSR share grant ranges from 0% to 220% of the original number of contingent TSR shares awarded. Dividend equivalents are awarded at the end of the performance period, based on the actual number of shares earned and paid to an executive. TSR shares are intended to reward executives only when we provide a greater long-term return to shareholders relative to a percentage of the comparison set of companies, which is consistent with our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. In February 2021, the following TSR shares were awarded to each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. McGarry, 22,938; Mr. Morales, 5,612; Ms. Liebert, 4,270; Mr. Knavish, 4,270; and Ms. Foulkes, 2,684. Such awards are consistent with our program to distribute long-term incentive awards equally among three different equity-based vehicles, as discussed above under “Long-Term Incentive Compensation.” The performance period for the TSR shares granted in 2019 ended on December 31, 2021. PPG’s total shareholder return was measured against that of the S&P 500 (as described above) over the three-year period ending ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 57 ​ Table of Contents December 31, 2021. PPG’s ranking on this performance measure was at the 56th percentile, resulting in payouts at 92.8% of target. The payouts were distributed 50% in shares of PPG common stock and 50% in cash. The cash payment was calculated based on the average PPG stock closing price during the month of December 2021. Payouts to the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table for the 2019 TSR grants were: Mr. McGarry, 11,276 shares and $1,862,570; Mr. Morales, 2,232 shares and $368,517; Ms. Liebert, 1,410 shares and $232,739; Mr. Knavish, 1,410 shares and $232,739; and Ms. Foulkes, 706 shares and $116,452. Such share payouts, which vested in December 2021, are reflected in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table. Changes to the TSR Share Awards During 2019, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee undertook a review of our long-term incentive compensation program and reviewed benchmark analyses of the long-term incentive programs of similar companies. Based on this review, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee, at its February 19, 2020, meeting approved modifying the TSR share performance scale. Beginning with 2020 awards, TSR share grants will be paid in accordance with the following scale: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ PPG TSR GRANT PAYOUT 90 th percentile 200 % 80 th percentile 175 % 70 th percentile 150 % 60 th percentile 125 % 50 th percentile 100 % 40 th percentile 75 % 30 th percentile 50 % Below — % Performance-based RSUs. Performance-based RSUs, or PBRSUs, represent a contingent share grant that is made at the beginning of a three-calendar-year performance period and vests on the last day of the performance period. If we achieve certain pre-determined performance thresholds, payment is settled in shares of PPG common stock in the February immediately after the end of the three-year performance period. The performance criteria for each year in the three-year performance period were 10% growth in adjusted earnings per diluted share and 11% cash flow return on capital, taking into account the same adjustment categories utilized by the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee in determining adjusted earnings per diluted share for purposes of annual incentive awards (see “Annual Incentive Awards” above). If minimum performance is not achieved, no shares are issued with respect to the grant. If performance is above target, the number of shares issued may exceed the original number of contingent shares awarded. The minimum and maximum number of shares that may be issued upon settlement of an PBRSU ranges from 0% to 180% of the original number of contingent shares awarded, depending on the number of goals attained during the three-year period (see the table below for a breakdown of the payout percentages). No dividend equivalents are awarded on performance-based RSUs. By including performance-based RSUs in the long-term incentive mix, executives are rewarded when financial performance objectives are achieved over an extended period of time. Summarized below are the material provisions of the performance-based RSUs: ​ ​ ​ BASIS OF PAYOUT PERFORMANCE PERIOD VESTING AND PAYOUT OF BENEFIT Performance Goals: ​ • 10% growth in adjusted earnings per diluted share ​ • 11% cash flow return on capital ​ Payout is 0% to 180% of original PBRSU shares awarded: 3 calendar years • Vest on last day of performance period ​ • Settled in shares in the February immediately after the end of performance period ​ • No dividend equivalents are awarded ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ GOALS ATTAINED IN PERFORMANCE PERIOD PAYOUT 6 goals 180 % 4 or 5 goals in 3 years 150 % 4 goals in 2 years 100 % 3 goals 100 % 2 goals 50 % 1 goal 25 % 0 goals — % ​ ​ ​ 58 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents In February 2021, the following PBRSUs were awarded to each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. McGarry, 24,192; Mr. Morales, 5,919; Ms. Liebert, 4,504; Mr. Knavish, 4,504; and Ms. Foulkes, 2,831. Such awards are consistent with our program to distribute long-term incentive awards equally among three different equity-based vehicles, as discussed above under “Long-Term Incentive Compensation.” The performance period for the PBRSUs granted in 2019 ended on December 31, 2021. For the 2019 grants, four of the annual goals were achieved in three years, yielding payouts at 150% of target. Specifically, the results were as follows: PBRSU Performance Measures for 2019-2021 Performance Period ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2019 ​ 2020 ​ 2021 ​ 2019 - 2021 ​ ​ EPS ​ CASH FLOW ​ EPS ​ CASH FLOW ​ EPS ​ CASH FLOW ​ TOTAL GOALS ​ ​ GROWTH ​ ROC ​ GROWTH ​ ROC ​ GROWTH ​ ROC ​ MET Goal Result 7.8 % 17.4 % (8.4) % 17.8 % 10.6 % 11.0 % Goals Met — 1 — 1 1 1 4 ​ The Company made share payouts to the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table for the 2019 PBRSU grants as follows: Mr. McGarry, 38,640; Mr. Morales, 7,643; Ms. Liebert, 4,830; Mr. Knavish, 4,830; and Ms. Foulkes, 2,415. Such payouts, which vested in December 2021, are reflected in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table. Changes to the Performance-based RSU Awards The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee’s 2019 review of PPG’s long-term incentive compensation program noted above showed that PPG’s PBRSU awards are somewhat uniquely designed and that a larger portion of our RSUs are performance based than the peer group. Recognizing this, at its February 19, 2020 meeting, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee also approved modifying the methodology used to calculate the payout of the PBRSUs. With respect to the earnings per share goal, instead of using discrete goals that are or are not met based on achieving 10% earnings per share growth, beginning with 2020 awards the earnings per diluted share growth portion of the PBRSU awards will utilize a linear payment scale that will be calculated annually as shown below: EPS GROWTH (ANNUAL ) ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL PAYOUT FACTOR < 5.0% 0.0% 5.0% 50.0% 6.0% 60.0% 7.0% 70.0% 8.0% 80.0% 9.0% 90.0% >= 10.0% 100.0% Achievement of 10% growth in adjusted earnings per diluted share will still be required to receive 100% of the original share grant. A payout scale will not be applied to the cash flow return on capital goal, which will still require achievement of 11% for this goal to be met each year. Performance against the adjusted earnings per diluted share goal and the cash flow return on capital goal will be calculated annually, and the annual payout for each goal will be weighted equally over the three-year period. The table below provides a hypothetical example of how PBRSU awards will be calculated using the new payout scales: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 59 ​ Table of Contents ​ ​ RESULT PAYOUT FACTOR PORTION OF PERFORMANCE CYCLE PAYOUT % ACHIEVED EPS Growth 2020 9.2% 92.0% 1/3 30.6% 2021 10.0% 100.0% 1/3 33.3% 2022 11.0% 100.0% 1/3 33.3% ​ ​ ​ ​ 97.2% Cash Flow ROC 2020 13.0% 100.0% 1/3 33.3% 2021 18.0% 100.0% 1/3 33.3% 2022 10.0% 0.0% 1/3 0.0% ​ ​ ​ ​ 66.6% Total PBRSU payout (EPS Growth plus Cash Flow ROC) 163.8% ​ ​ Under this revised methodology, the maximum PBRSU payout will be 200% of the original share grant if the highest level for all six goals are met in the three-year performance period. Perquisites and Other Benefits In addition to the annual and long-term compensation described above, executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table receive certain perquisites and other benefits. Such perquisites may include financial counseling services and limited personal use of PPG’s corporate aircraft. At the direction of the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee, in 2011 executive officer perquisites were reviewed and reduced. Effective January 1, 2012, personal club memberships were discontinued. Other benefits for our executive officers may include Company matching contributions under our Deferred Compensation Plan. These perquisites and other benefits are provided to increase the availability of the executives to focus on the business of the enterprise or because we believe they are important to our ability to attract and retain top-quality executive talent. The costs to PPG associated with providing these benefits for executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table are reflected in the “All Other Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table and in the All Other Compensation Table. We also provide other benefits, such as medical, dental and life insurance and disability coverage, to each executive named in the Summary Compensation Table under our benefit plans, which are also provided to most eligible U.S.-based salaried employees. In addition, all of our U.S.-based executive officers are eligible to participate in the PPG Industries Foundation Matching Gift Program, which encourages charitable donations by all of our U.S. employees by matching their contributions to eligible institutions. Contributions of up to a total of $10,000 per year, in most cases, may be matched under the program. Most charitable organizations are eligible for the Matching Gifts Program, with a few exceptions. The value of these benefits is not included in the Summary Compensation Table because such benefits are made available on a Company-wide basis to most U.S. salaried employees. We also provide vacation and other paid holidays to all employees, including the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table, which are comparable to those provided at other large companies. Deferred Compensation Opportunities and Retirement Plans Another aspect of our executive compensation program is our Deferred Compensation Plan. The plan is a voluntary, non-tax qualified, unfunded, deferred compensation plan available to all U.S.-based executive officers and other participants in our management incentive plans to enable them to save for retirement by deferring a portion of their current compensation. The plan also provides eligible employees with supplemental contributions equal to the contributions they would have received under our Employee Savings Plan, but for certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, compensation may be deferred until death, disability, retirement or termination or, in the case of the cash portion of certain incentive awards, other earlier specified dates the participants may select. Deferred amounts (other than the PPG common stock portion of deferred incentive awards, which must be invested in PPG stock) are credited to an investment account that earns a return based on the investment options chosen by the participant. The value of a participant’s investment account is based on the value of the investments selected. Benefits are paid out of our general assets. For certain longer-serving, U.S.-based, salaried employees, we maintain both a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Substantially all employees in the U.S., including our executive officers, participate in the PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan. For additional information concerning our Deferred Compensation Plan, pension plans and the PPG Industries Employee Savings ​ ​ ​ 60 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Plan, see “Pension Benefits” and “PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan” and the accompanying Pension Benefits Table and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table. ​ ​ ​ ​ WHY YOU SHOULD APPROVE OUR SAY-ON-PAY? ​ ​ The Board believes that PPG’s executive compensation program aligns the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders. Our executive compensation is based on our pay for performance philosophy, which emphasizes executive performance measures that correlate closely with the achievement of both shorter term performance objectives and longer term shareholder value creation. At the 2021 Annual Meeting, we held a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a say-on-pay vote. Our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 91% of shareholder votes cast in favor of our 2021 say-on-pay resolution. Following its review of this vote, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee recommended to the full Board that we retain our general approach to executive compensation, with an emphasis on short- and long-term incentive compensation that rewards our executive officers when they deliver value for our shareholders. Consistent with this philosophy: ● Our performance metrics are focused on increasing shareholder value and are tied to measures impacting both shorter-term and longer-term performance. Shorter-term performance metrics include adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, cash flow from operating activities-continuing operations, earnings before interest and taxes, working capital reduction, price increase and sales volume growth. Longer-term performance metrics include total shareholder return, adjusted earnings per diluted share growth, adjusted cash flow return on capital and stock price appreciation. ● Payment of long-term incentive awards is based solely on Company performance. We have three-year award and payout cycles for both performance-based restricted stock units and total shareholder return shares. We also have three-year vesting for stock options. ● Between 74% and 90% of the named executive officers’ target total direct compensation opportunity for 2021 was in the form of performance-based variable compensation and long term incentives motivating them to deliver strong business performance and create shareholder value. ● While our financial performance was strong, we did not achieve our adjusted cash flow from operating activities target, which lowered the payout. ● Executive stock ownership goals align the interests of executives with shareholders. ● We provide very limited perquisites to our executive officers. ● Our officers may not engage in transactions that are contrary to the interests of shareholders, such as “short sales,” “short sales against the box,” “put” and “call” options and hedging transactions designed to minimize an executive’s risk inherent in owning PPG stock. In addition, officers may not hold PPG stock in a margin account and may not pledge PPG stock as collateral for a loan. ● Executive officers are subject to a “clawback” policy that is designed to recoup incentive compensation when a financial restatement occurs and certain other conditions exist. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 61 ​ Table of Contents COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Summary Compensation Table (2019-2021) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ CHANGE ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ IN PENSION ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ VALUE AND ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NONQUALIFIED ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NON-EQUITY ​ DEFERRED ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ STOCK ​ OPTION ​ INCENTIVE PLAN ​ COMPENSATION ​ ALL OTHER ​ ​ ​ NAME AND POSITION ​ YEAR ​ SALARY (3) ​ BONUS (4) ​ AWARDS (5) ​ AWARDS (6) ​ COMPENSATION (7) ​ EARNINGS (8) ​ COMPENSATION (9) ​ TOTAL M. H. McGarry 2021 ​ $ 1,300,000 ​ $ — ​ $ 6,266,679 ​ $ 3,133,323 ​ $ 2,250,000 ​ $ (218,598) ​ $ 468,212 ​ $ 13,199,616 Chairman and Chief 2020 ​ $ 1,164,167 ​ $ — ​ $ 5,499,994 ​ $ 2,749,715 ​ $ 1,950,000 ​ $ 4,289,632 ​ $ 250,485 ​ $ 15,903,993 Executive Officer 2019 ​ $ 1,265,000 ​ $ — ​ $ 5,333,357 ​ $ 2,666,565 ​ $ 1,850,000 ​ $ 3,827,671 ​ $ 175,345 ​ $ 15,117,938 V.

Liebert and Foulkes, their base salary was reduced by 25% to $532,500, $525,000, $525,000 and $405,000, respectively. The full base salaries were restated effective August 2020 as follows: Mr. McGarry, $1,300,000; Mr. Morales, $710,000; Ms. Liebert, $700,000; Mr. Knavish, $700,000; and Ms. Foulkes, $540,000.

(4) The named executive officers were not entitled to receive any payments that would be characterized as “Bonus” payments for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Amounts listed under the column “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” constitute annual incentive awards for 2021, 2020 and 2019 that were determined by the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee at its February 16, 2022, February 17, 2021 and February 19, 2020 meetings, respectively, and, to the extent not deferred by an executive, were paid out shortly thereafter. (5) The amounts in this column represent the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for grants occurring in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 of performance-based restricted stock units, or PBRSUs, and performance-based total shareholder return contingent shares, or TSRs, granted as part of the long-term incentive components of our compensation program described on pages 56 through 60. The assumptions used in calculating these amounts for 2021 are set forth in Note 13 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is located on pages 55 through 61 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. PBRSUs and TSRs are subject to performance conditions, and the grant date fair value shown is based on performance at target levels, which is the probable outcome of such conditions. The value of these awards made in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, assuming that the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved, is as follows: Mr. McGarry $12,533,357; Mr. Morales, $3,066,456; Ms. Liebert, $2,333,280; Mr. Knavish, $2,333,280; and Ms. Foulkes, $1,466,611. The value of these awards made in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, assuming that the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved, is as follows: Mr. McGarry $10,999,988; Mr. Morales, $2,666,617; Ms. Liebert, $1,866,705; Mr. Knavish, $1,866,705; and Ms. Foulkes, $1,066,554. The value of these awards made in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, assuming that the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved, is as follows: Mr. McGarry, $10,666,716; Mr. Morales, $2,133,581; Ms. Liebert, $1,333,219; and Mr. Knavish, $1,333,219. (6) The amounts in this column represent the grant date fair value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for stock option grants occurring in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 as part of the long-term incentive component of our compensation program described on pages 56 through 60. The assumptions used in calculating these amounts are set forth in Note 13 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is located on pages 55 through 61of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. (7) The amounts in this column reflect the dollar value of annual incentive awards for 2021, 2020 and 2019, as described on pages 52 through 56. (8) The amounts in this column reflect the actuarial increase in the present value of the named executive officer’s benefits under our qualified and non-qualified pension plans, determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in our financial statements, except that retirement age is assumed to be normal retirement age as defined in the applicable plan.

Pension Benefits For certain longer-serving, U.S.-based, salaried employees we maintain both a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, called Retirement Plan C, and a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan, called the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are not eligible to participate in these plans. Each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table participates in these plans, with the exception of Ms. Liebert. The executives named below ceased to accrue benefits under Retirement Plan C on December 31, 2020. The table below shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to each such named executive officer as of December 31, 2021, including the number of years of service credited to each such named executive officer, under each of Retirement Plan C and the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan, determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in our financial statements. The material terms of Retirement Plan C and the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan are described below.

As further described in the narrative discussion following this table, the estimated lump-sum present value under the Non-Qualified Pension Plan to which the officer would be entitled is as follows: Mr. McGarry, $27,860,730; and Ms. Foulkes, $3,528,969. ​ ​ ​ 66 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents The values reflected in the “Present Value of Accumulated Benefit” column of the Pension Benefits Table are equal to the actuarial present value of each officer’s accrued benefit under the applicable plan as of December 31, 2021, using the same actuarial factors and assumptions used for financial statement reporting purposes, except that retirement age is assumed to be normal retirement age as defined in the applicable plan. These assumptions are described under Note 13 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is located on pages 55 through 61 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In accordance with Item 402(h) of Regulation S-K, the present value amounts are calculated using a 2.87% discount rate for Retirement Plan C and 2.78% discount rate for the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan. The lump-sum payment amounts for the Non-Qualified Pension Plan are calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Non-Qualified Pension Plan using the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation discount rate of 0.00% as in effect on December 31, 2021, rather than the 2.78% discount rate used for financial statement reporting purposes. The benefit payable under Retirement Plan C is a function of the participant’s five-year average annual covered base compensation for the highest five consecutive years out of the final ten years immediately prior to retirement and credited years of service. In January 2011, Retirement Plan C was amended such that eligible employees with combined age and service points fewer than 60 and actively employed by the Company as of December 31, 2011 ceased to accrue benefits under Retirement Plan C as of December 31, 2011. Eligible employees with combined age and service points of 60 or more and actively employed by the Company at December 31, 2011 ceased to accrue benefits under Retirement Plan C upon the earlier of their retirement date or December 31, 2020. Eligible employees now earn retirement benefits through the PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan. The Non-Qualified Retirement Plan’s benefit is supplemental to the qualified plan’s benefit in that the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan provides a benefit that is substantially equal to the difference between the amount that would have been payable under the qualified Retirement Plan C, in the absence of legislation limiting the compensation covered by the plan, and the amount actually payable under Retirement Plan C. The Non-Qualified Retirement Plan also includes a benefit based on bonus awards for certain U.S. management bonus program participants. The benefit payable under the Non-Qualified Plan is determined in the same manner as for Retirement Plan C with regard to credited service and base salary above legislative limits; incentive payments are factored in by using the average of the highest five payments during the last ten years prior to retirement. Retirement Plan C contains the following material terms: ● The normal form of benefit is a life annuity for unmarried participants and a joint and 50% survivor annuity for married participants; ● A participant may elect out of the normal form of benefit and receive an actuarially-equivalent alternative form of benefit, including a single life annuity (for a married participant) or a joint and survivor annuity with a survivor benefit ranging from 1%-100%, as selected by the participant; ● There is no lump-sum benefit option; ● A participant may elect early retirement up to ten years prior to the participant’s normal retirement age, subject to reduction of the retirement benefit to reflect the early commencement of the benefit; and ● A participant has a fully vested benefit under the plan upon completing five years of service or reaching early retirement age. The Non-Qualified Plan contains the following material terms: ● A participant is entitled to a distribution upon reaching the later of their early retirement date (as defined in the qualified plan) or the participant’s termination of employment; ● The normal form of payment for benefits at retirement for the group of participants that includes each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table who participates in the plan is a lump-sum payment; and ● A participant has a fully vested benefit under the plan upon completing five years of service or reaching early retirement age, but their accrued benefit is subject to forfeiture if the participant engages in any competitive activity, or other activity that is deemed contrary or harmful to the interests of PPG. PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan The PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan covers substantially all employees in the U.S. All of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table participate in the Savings Plan. The Company makes matching contributions to the Savings Plan, at management’s discretion, based upon participants’ savings, subject to certain limitations. For most participants, Company-matching contributions are established each year at the discretion of the Company and are applied to participant savings up to a maximum of 6% of eligible participant compensation. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 67 ​ Table of Contents Employees can contribute from 1% to 50% of eligible plan compensation to the Savings Plan, subject to certain Plan or legal limits that may apply. Employees are always 100% vested in any money employees contribute or the Company contributes to the Savings Plan as a matching contribution. Executive officers and certain other employees also receive additional Company contributions to the Employee Savings Plan. These contributions are between 2% and 5% of a participant’s eligible plan compensation, based on age and years of service. If contributions made for the benefit of an executive are limited due to requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, we credit such excess contributions to the executive officer’s account in the Deferred Compensation Plan. These contributions vest upon completion of three years of service with the Company. In the U.S., we maintain the Deferred Compensation Plan to allow participants, including each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table, to defer a portion of their compensation in a phantom PPG stock account or other phantom investment accounts. The amount deferred earns a return based on the investment options selected by the executive officer. Executive officers may elect to defer up to 50% of their base salary, and up to 100% of any incentive award, TSR share award and restricted stock unit award that the executive officer may be entitled to receive. All dividend equivalents earned on TSR share award grants are deferred into the Deferred Compensation Plan. We also may make certain additional contributions to the executive officer’s account. For example, if the executive officer’s contributions under the Employee Savings Plan are limited due to requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, we will credit such excess contributions to the executive officer’s account under the Deferred Compensation Plan. The executive officer is always fully vested in compensation that he or she elects to have deferred into the plan and any contributions made on behalf of the executive officer related to the Employee Savings Plan. Company contributions are invested proportionally into the investment options chosen by the employee. The table below shows the Deferred Compensation Plan’s current investment options and their respective annual rate of return for the year ended December 31, 2021, as reported by the administrator of the plan. ​ ​ ​ ​ INVESTMENT OPTION RATE OF RETURN PPG Stock Account 20.96 % Fidelity Growth Company Fund 22.67 % Fidelity Contrafund 24.36 % Fidelity US Equity Index Fund 28.69 % Fidelity Intermediate Bond Fund (1.33) % Fidelity Government Money Market 0.01 % The amount owed to executive officers under the Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded and unsecured general obligation of PPG. An executive officer receives a distribution of the balance in their plan account upon retirement, death, disability, termination of employment, a scheduled payment date, financial hardship (for amounts deferred prior to January 1, 2005) or unforeseeable emergency (for amounts deferred after December 31, 2004). Distributions can be in the form of a lump sum or installments. Payment can commence at the time of separation or, in certain situations, can be deferred until a later point in time. Compensation deferred prior to January 1, 2005 and related earnings are distributed according to the executive officer’s election. Compensation deferred after December 31, 2004 and related earnings are distributed according to the executive officer’s election only in the case of retirement (no earlier than six months following retirement). In the case of disability or termination, the distribution is made in a lump sum on the date that is the later of (i) the first day of the first quarter of a plan year that is six months and ten days following the separation or (ii) January 1 of the year following the separation. In the case of death, a distribution is made to the executive officer’s beneficiary as soon as administratively possible. Distributions from the PPG stock account are in the form of PPG common stock and distributions from all other investment options are in cash.

Compensatory Arrangements with Certain Executive Officers Rebecca B. Liebert. Rebecca Liebert currently serves as Executive Vice President of PPG. Upon her joining PPG as Senior Vice President, Automotive Coatings in June 2018, Ms. Liebert and PPG agreed to the following compensatory arrangement: ● A signing bonus of $1,200,000 and cash bonus of $140,000 paid in February 2019, both of which are subject to repayment should Ms. Liebert resign within two years of the payment of either of these bonuses. ● A starting base salary of $625,000 per year. ● A prorated, target bonus percentage for 2018 of 70% of Ms. Liebert’s salary. ● A grant in June 2018 of stock options, performance-based RSUs and TSR shares with an aggregate value of $1,000,000 on the grant date pursuant to PPG’s Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The RSUs and TSRs shares vest in February 2021 and the stock options vest on June 25, 2021. ● A grant in February 2019 of stock options, performance-based RSUs and TSR shares with an aggregate value of $1,000,000 on the grant date pursuant to the Plan. ● A one-time grant of time-based RSUs with an aggregate value of $3,145,000 on June 25, 2018 pursuant to the Plan with a vesting schedule of:  $1,075,000 on December 31, 2019, $1,500,000 on December 31, 2020, $420,000 on December 31, 2022, and $150,000 on December 31, 2023. ● In the event that Ms. Liebert is not selected by the Board of Directors as the next Chief Executive Officer of the Company as part of the Board of Directors’ normal succession planning process and decides to resign as a result, she will be entitled to a severance payment equal to two times her annual base salary under the following conditions: ● she remains employed and performs at a successful or above level for the 12 month period following the effective date of the appointment; ● her resignation is effective immediately following the expiration of the 12 month period; and ● she signs PPG’s standard separation agreement. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 69 ​ Table of Contents POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL The tables below reflect the amount of compensation to each of our currently serving executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in the event of termination of such executive’s employment under certain circumstances. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2021, and thus includes amounts earned through such time and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to the executives upon their termination. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such executive’s separation from PPG. For purposes of calculating the estimated potential payments to our officers under the Non-Qualified Pension Plan, as reflected in the tables below, we have used the same actuarial factors and assumptions used for financial statement reporting purposes and set forth under Note 13 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is located on pages 55 through 61 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the amounts reflected in the tables below for the Non-Qualified Pension Plan are calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Non-Qualified Pension Plan using the 2.78% discount rate for our U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plan that is used for financial statement reporting purposes. Potential Payments and Benefits Upon Termination The first column of each table below sets forth the payments to which the officer would be entitled, other than accrued but unpaid base salary and any benefits payable or provided under broad-based employee benefit plans and programs, in the event of a termination of the officer’s employment for any reason by PPG or the officer, and assuming such termination occurred prior to, or did not otherwise arise in connection with, a change in control of PPG. The second column of each table reflects payments that would be due in the event of the officer’s termination of employment due to death prior to a change in control of PPG. In any of these events, we are not obligated to provide other health or welfare benefits or any special severance payments, accelerated vesting of equity compensation or tax gross-ups to the officers. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are not eligible to participate in the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan. Ms. Liebert is not included in the table below because she does not participate in the Non- Qualified Retirement Plan and as of December 31, 2021 she did not receive financial counseling.

Potential Payments and Benefits Upon Termination Following, or in Connection with, a Change in Control of PPG We have entered into change in control agreements with our executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table and with certain other officers. The change in control agreements have three-year terms, which terms are automatically extended for one year upon each anniversary unless a notice not to extend is given by PPG. If a “change in control” occurs during the term of an agreement, then the agreement becomes operative for a fixed three-year period. The agreements provide generally that the officer’s terms and conditions of employment (including position, location, compensation and benefits) will not be adversely changed during the three-year period after a change in control of PPG. The change in control agreements also contain non-competition provisions and confidentiality provisions prohibiting the officer from divulging or communicating, without our prior consent or except as required by law, any confidential information, knowledge or data relating to PPG or its business during the officer’s employment and at all times thereafter. The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee approved certain changes to our change in control agreements, which are described under “Changes to Form of Change in Control Agreement.” Termination For Cause or Other Than For Good Reason. Under the change in control agreements, in the event of an officer’s termination of employment by PPG for cause or by the officer other than for good reason during the three-year period following a change in control, the officer will receive payment only of their accrued but unpaid base salary and any benefits payable or provided under broad-based employee benefit plans and programs. Termination Without Cause or For Good Reason. If PPG terminates the officer’s employment (other than for cause, death or disability) or the officer terminates their employment for good reason during the three-year period following a change in control, and upon certain terminations prior to a change in control or in connection with or in anticipation of a change in control, the officer is generally entitled to receive the following payments and benefits: ● a pro-rata bonus for the year of the date of termination based on the officer’s highest annual bonus during the three years prior to the change in control or the annual bonus for the most recent fiscal year after the change in control, whichever is higher (such higher amount referred to herein as the “highest annual bonus”); ● three times the officer’s annual base salary; ● three times the officer’s highest annual bonus; ● a lump-sum payment having an actuarial present value equal to the additional pension benefits the officer would have received if he or she had continued to be employed by PPG for an additional three years for purposes of both age and service credit, assuming the officer’s compensation for each such additional year is equal to their annual base salary prior to the change in control (or any higher salary thereafter) and their annual bonus is at least equal to the officer’s highest annual bonus during the three years prior to the change in control (the “Pension Differential”); ● a lump-sum payment equal to the present value of any employer contributions the executive would have received or accrued under PPG’s defined contribution retirement plans and arrangements (whether qualified or non-qualified) in which the executive participates if the executive’s employment continued for an additional three years in respect of retirement benefits provided in the form of a defined contribution retirement plan, program or arrangement, but ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 71 ​ Table of Contents excluding any salary or pay deferral contributions to such plans or arrangements that are deemed to be employer contributions under applicable law; ● continued medical, dental and life insurance benefits for three years and continued age and service credit for purposes of determining the officer’s eligibility for retiree medical benefits; ● continued payment of financial counseling expenses for the officer for three years; and ● a payment in an amount sufficient to make the officer whole for any excise tax on excess parachute payments imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The table below sets forth the amounts each executive officer named in the Summary Compensation Table would be entitled to receive, other than accrued but unpaid base salary and any benefits payable or provided under broad-based employee benefit plans and programs, in the event of a termination of the executive officer’s employment by PPG without cause or by the executive officer for good reason following or in connection with a change in control of PPG. For purposes of calculating the estimated potential payment to such executive officers with respect to the Pension Differential under the change in control agreements, as reflected in the table below, we have used the same actuarial factors and assumptions used for financial statement reporting purposes and set forth under Note 13 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is located on pages 55 through 61 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including a discount rate of 2.87% for Retirement Plan C and 2.78% for our U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plan and assuming a lump-sum payment of the Pension Differential. Termination During the 30-Day Window Period. Under certain of our change in control agreements, if an officer terminates their employment for any reason during a 30-day window period following the first anniversary of the change in control, the officer will be entitled to the payments and benefits described above, except that the multiplier of three referenced above would be two for purposes of all payments and benefits for which the multiplier is relevant. Definitions. For purposes of the agreements, the terms set forth below generally have the meanings described below. “Change in Control” generally includes the occurrence of any of the following events or circumstances: (i) the acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of PPG or the voting power of the outstanding voting securities of PPG, other than any acquisition from or by PPG or any PPG-sponsored employee benefit plan; (ii) the individuals who, as of the date of the agreement, constitute the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date of the agreement whose election, or nomination for election by the Company’s shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board are considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than the Board; (iii) shareholder approval of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all of the assets of PPG, unless following such transaction PPG’s historic shareholders retain at least 60% ownership of the surviving entity, no shareholder acquires a 20% or more ownership interest in the surviving entity and a majority of the surviving entity’s board of directors were members of our Board at the time such transaction was approved; (iv) shareholder approval of a dissolution or liquidation of PPG; or (v) a determination by a majority of our Board that a change in control has occurred. “Cause” generally means (i) the willful and continued failure of the officer to perform their duties; or (ii) the willful engaging by the officer in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to PPG. “Good reason” generally means (i) the assignment of duties inconsistent with the officer’s position, authority, duties or responsibilities in effect at the time of the change in control, or any other action resulting in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, other than isolated and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith that is remedied promptly; (ii) failure to provide the employment compensation and benefits required under the change in control agreement, other than an isolated and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith that is remedied promptly; or (iii) a relocation or substantial change in the officer’s workplace or the company’s requiring the officer to travel on company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the change in control. ​ ​ ​ 72 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Changes to Form of Change in Control Agreement. The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee has made modifications to the form of change in control agreement for officers in response to current trends in executive compensation and to a shareholder proposal that was supported by shareholders at the 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. PPG began entering into the revised agreements in 2008 with certain newly hired or promoted officers. Key revisions include: ● Modification of the definition of “change in control” to require “consummation” of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all of the assets of PPG. ● Modification of the definition of “compensation” to include “target” bonus instead of the “highest” bonus over the last three years. This change affects the cash payment and the Pension Differential calculation. ● Modification of certain termination provisions, including elimination of the window period termination. ● Modification of the excise tax and gross-up provision to replace the full gross up with a “conditional” gross up, which provides for a reduction in change in control payments if such payments trigger an excise tax by a limited amount. ● Elimination of the provisions providing for the payment of financial counseling and legal expenses. In subsequent years, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee made additional modifications to the form of change in control agreement for officers in response to current trends in executive compensation. The key revisions include: ● Elimination of the excise tax gross-up entirely. ● Including a “conditional” payment limitation, which provides for a reduction in change of control payments if such payments would trigger an excise tax, unless a larger amount would be received on an after-tax basis without a payment reduction. ● Modification of the definition of Retirement and the associated benefits related to retirement to ensure that all applicable provisions are applied properly for executives who only participated in the former PPG Defined Contribution Retirement Plan and non-U.S. executives who do not participate in either Retirement Plan C or the former Defined Contribution Retirement Plan. ● Elimination of potential double payments under other PPG severance provisions or statutory requirements and the change in control agreement. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 73 ​ Table of Contents Change in Control Involuntary or Good Reason Termination (2021) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ INVOLUNTARY OR ​ ​ GOOD REASON ​ ​ TERMINATION M.

The table below reflects the calculation of the aggregate dollar values related to acceleration of vesting of the incentive equity awards held by the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in the event of a termination following a change in control, and the total is reflected in the “Accelerated Vesting of LTI” row for each officer in the table above. The stock option value was calculated by multiplying the number of unvested shares by the difference between the grant price and the closing stock price on December 31, 2021 ($172.44). If any stock options were underwater as of December 31, 2021, no value was assigned to such options. The TSR share and restricted stock unit value was calculated by multiplying the target number of unvested shares by the closing stock price on December 31, 2021, except as otherwise noted.

Total compensation amounts are required to be calculated using the Securities and Exchange Commission’s compensation disclosure rules applicable to reporting compensation in the Summary Compensation Table of the Proxy Statement. Median employee compensation used to calculate the pay ratio is required to be the total compensation paid to an actual employee of the Company. We identified our median employee using our total employee population as of October 1, 2021 by applying a consistently applied compensation measure across our global employee population. For our consistently applied compensation measure, we used annual base salary. We used an annual base salary as our consistently applied compensation measure as it represents the primary compensation component paid to all of our employees. As a result, annual base salary provides an accurate depiction of total earnings for the purpose of identifying our median employee. We then calculated the median employee’s total annual compensation in accordance with the requirements of the Summary Compensation Table. We did not use any material estimates, assumptions, adjustments or statistical sampling to determine the worldwide median employee. The methodology we used to determine the median was unchanged from 2020. Our median employee’s total 2021 compensation was $37,282. Our Chief Executive Officer’s total 2021 compensation was $13,199,616 as reported in the Summary Compensation Table. Accordingly, our 2021 CEO to Median Employee Pay Ratio was 354:1. The annual salary of the median employee in 2021 was comparable to the annual salary of the median employee in 2020. The lower amount of the median employee’s total compensation for 2021 was the result of a lower bonus payout received by the median employee in 2021 versus 2020. Each individual’s total annual compensation can be comprised of different compensation elements and is dependent on where the individual works globally. Please keep in mind that under Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and guidance, there are numerous ways to determine the compensation of a company’s median employee, including the employee population sampled, the elements of pay and benefits used, any assumptions made and the use of statistical sampling. In addition, no two companies have identical employee populations or compensation programs, and pay, benefits and retirement plans differ by country even within the same company. As such, our pay ratio may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. ​ ​ ​ ​ 76 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents PROPOSAL 2: Advisory Vote on Approval of the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers As required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are including in this Proxy Statement a non-binding, advisory shareholder vote on our executive compensation as described in this Proxy Statement (commonly referred to as “say-on-pay”). Based upon the vote of our shareholders at the 2011 and 2017 Annual Meetings and the Board’s recommendation, PPG has provided this advisory vote on an annual basis. We encourage shareholders to review the section of this Proxy Statement relating to executive compensation on pages 42 through 75. The Board believes that PPG’s executive compensation program aligns the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders. Executive compensation is based on our pay-for-performance philosophy, which emphasizes executive performance measures that correlate closely with the achievement of both shorter-term performance objectives and longer-term shareholder value. To this end, a substantial portion of our executives’ annual and long-term compensation is performance-based, with the payment being contingent on the achievement of performance goals. We believe our program strikes the appropriate balance between utilizing responsible, measured pay practices and effectively incentivizing our executives to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our shareholders. This balance is evidenced by the following: ● In 2021, the Company delivered record net sales despite the global COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing raw material and transportation availability challenges, which significantly impacted the Company’s 2021 performance and businesses. Organic sales were higher by 10%, including sales volume growth and higher selling prices. Total net sales from continuing operations for 2021 were approximately $16.8 billion, up about 21% compared to 2020. The Company’s 2021 full-year reported net income from continuing operations was $1.4 billion, or $5.93 per diluted share versus $1.1 billion, or $4.44 per diluted share, in 2020. Full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased about 11% year-over-year to a record $6.77 compared with $6.12 in 2020. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for 2021 was $1.62 billion, versus $1.45 billion in 2020. ● In 2021, the Company generated approximately $1.6 billion in adjusted cash flow from operations, which is lower than 2020 due to higher absolute working capital as a result of increased sales and higher priced inventory due to raw material inflation. ● Operating working capital as a percent of sales as of December 2021 was comparable to December 2020. ● Our business portfolio continued to demonstrate its resiliency with record full year net sales, up about 21% compared to the prior year. ● Selling prices increased nearly 5% compared to prior year. ● Sales volume growth increased over 5% compared to prior year. ● In September, the Company raised the per-share dividend by nearly 10%—paying approximately $536 million in dividends in 2021. The Company also repurchased $210 million of stock in 2021. ● In 2021, the Company completed four acquisitions, increasing both geographic and product scope. Cash spending for these acquisitions totaled approximately $2.1 billion. The collective annualized sales of these four acquisitions and the acquisition completed in late 2020 was about $1.7 billion. ● The Company achieved about $135 million in cost savings from restructuring cost programs. ● The Company’s stock price increased 20% during 2021 providing value to our shareholders. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 77 ​ Table of Contents The following charts contain adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, net sales from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations as used for determining the compensation of our executive officers for each of the last five fiscal years: ​ ​ ​ Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share from Continuing Operations Net Sales (In Millions USD) Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations (In Millions USD) ​ *2017 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share include $15 million ($0.06) for the results of the North American fiber glass business through August 31, 2017, which has been recast as discontinued operations for all periods presented, but which is included in the compensation metric. These figures also include $20 million ($0.08) for the impact of raw materials and Puerto Rican business resulting from the 2017 natural disasters. **2019 Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share includes $0.16 for the year-over-year impact of foreign currency translation. *** Beginning in 2021, the Company reports adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding amortization expense relating to intangible assets from completed acquisitions. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2020 has been recast to exclude acquisition-related amortization expense. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for earnings per diluted share or net income or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the Company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. A Regulation G reconciliation of adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations to reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and net income from continuing operations is included in Annex A to this Proxy Statement. ● We had a solid performance in 2021. We achieved our 2021 targets for adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, price increase and sales volume growth. We did not achieve our adjusted cash flow from operating activities target. As a result, annual incentive awards were paid to executive officers ranged from 100% to 121% of target. Our total shareholder return over the past three years when measured against the S&P 500 was in the 56th percentile resulting in the payment of long term TSR share awards at 92.8% of target. ● Between 74% and 90% of the named executive officers’ target total direct compensation opportunity for 2021 was in the form of performance-based variable compensation and long-term incentives motivating them to deliver strong business performance and create shareholder value. ● Base salary and annual incentive targets for our executive officers are established annually to maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions. Target total annual compensation for each position is set at or near the market median. ● PPG’s compensation programs are reviewed annually to identify any inherent material risks to PPG created by these programs. Based on the results of the 2021 review, we concluded that the design of our compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long-term value of PPG. ● At the 2021 Annual Meeting, we held a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a say-on-pay vote. Our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 91% of shareholder votes cast in favor of our 2021 say-on-pay resolution. Following its review of this vote, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee recommended to the full Board that we retain our general approach to executive compensation, with an emphasis on short- and long-term incentive compensation that rewards our executive officers when they deliver value for our shareholders. Consistent with this philosophy: ● Our performance metrics are focused on increasing shareholder value and are tied to measures impacting both shorter-term and longer-term performance. Shorter-term performance metrics include adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, cash flow from operating activities–continuing operations, earnings before ​ ​ ​ 78 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents interest and taxes, working capital reduction, price increase and sales volume growth. Longer-term performance metrics include total shareholder return, adjusted earnings per diluted share growth, cash flow return on capital and stock price appreciation. ● Payment of long-term incentive awards is based solely on Company performance. We have three-year award and payout cycles for both performance-based restricted stock units, or PBRSUs, and total shareholder return shares, or TSR shares. We also have three-year vesting for stock options. ● We provide very limited perquisites to our executive officers. ● Our officers are subject to stock ownership requirements. Our Chief Executive Officer must own shares of PPG common stock with a value of six times his base salary, and the other executive officers must own shares of PPG common stock with a value of three times their base salary. Officers are expected to meet these ownership requirements within five years of election. Those officers who have not yet met this requirement are paid 20% of their annual incentive in PPG stock, which is restricted from sale for a period of two to five years. In addition, for officers who have been subject to the policy for more than five years at their current requirement level and have not met the ownership requirement, 100% of the vested shares delivered from the PBRSU award and TSR share award must be held by the officer for a minimum of one year and until the requirement is met. All executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table have met their ownership requirement. ● Our officers may not engage in transactions that are contrary to the interests of shareholders, such as “short sales,” “short sales against the box,” “put” and “call” options and hedging transactions designed to minimize an executive’s risk inherent in owning PPG stock. In addition, officers may not hold PPG stock in a margin account and may not pledge PPG stock as collateral for a loan. ● Executive officers are subject to a “clawback” policy that is designed to recoup incentive compensation when a financial restatement occurs and certain other conditions exist. ● We do not provide tax gross-ups on perquisites to our named executive officers. Accordingly, you are asked to vote on the following resolution: RESOLVED: The Board strongly endorses the Company’s executive compensation program and recommends that the shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution: that the shareholders approve the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement on pages 42 through 75 and disclosed in accordance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the tabular and narrative disclosure contained therein. Because the vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board or the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee, and neither the Board nor the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee will be required to take any action as a result of the outcome of the vote on this proposal. However, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee will carefully consider the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation programs. Vote Required Adoption of the resolution approving the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers will require the affirmative vote of more than one-half of the shares present, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote and voting (excluding abstentions) at the Annual Meeting. ​ THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY’S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 79 ​ Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: Proposal to Amend the Articles of Incorporation to Provide for the Annual Election of Directors PPG’s Board of Directors has unanimously approved and is recommending that shareholders approve an amendment to PPG’s Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to provide for the phased-in elimination of the classified board of directors structure and the annual election of directors. At PPG’s 2012, 2013, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Meetings of Shareholders, PPG presented the same proposal for approval by the Company’s shareholders. In 2012, 2013, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the proposal received the affirmative vote of approximately 99% of the votes cast, but approximately 67%, 68%, 74%, 79%, 74% and 79%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. Since PPG’s Articles of Incorporation require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock to approve a proposal to amend the Articles of Incorporation to declassify the Board, the proposals failed to receive the required vote. For the reasons discussed below, the Board of Directors has resolved to present this proposal to the Company’s shareholders again at this year’s Annual Meeting. In its review of our classified board structure, the Board has carefully weighed the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a classified board structure. The Board considered that many U.S. public companies have eliminated their classified board structures in recent years in favor of annual elections and that many investors now consider the election of directors to be the primary means for shareholders to influence corporate governance policies and to increase a board’s accountability. The Nominating and Governance Committee regularly considers and evaluates a broad range of corporate governance issues affecting PPG and takes into consideration feedback we receive from our shareholders. Our Board has responded to shareholder feedback on our classified board structure by placing management proposals to eliminate our classified board before our shareholders. By placing the weight of management behind these proposals, these proposals were more likely to achieve a successful vote as exemplified by votes in favor of this proposal of approximately 79% at two of the past three annual meetings. After carefully weighing these considerations and shareholder opinion on this topic and the vote received on this proposal at PPG’s recent annual meetings, the Board concluded that the annual election of all directors will both enhance our corporate governance practices and be an effective way to maintain and enhance the accountability of the Board. Accordingly, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to eliminate the classified board structure. PPG’s Articles of Incorporation currently provide that the Board shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible with members of each class serving for three-year terms. If this proposal is approved, all directors will be elected annually beginning at the 2025 Annual Meeting. The directors to be elected at the 2022 Annual Meeting will be elected to serve a full three-year term. The directors to be elected at the 2023 Annual Meeting will be elected to serve a two-year term. The directors to be elected at the 2024 Annual Meeting will be elected to serve a one-year term. At the 2025 Annual Meeting and at each meeting of shareholders thereafter, all directors will be elected annually. Because the declassification process discussed in this proposal would not be complete until the 2025 Annual Meeting, it would not operate to shorten the upcoming term of any of our directors nominated for election at the 2022 Annual Meeting, ensuring a smooth transition to annual elections of all of our directors. All directors elected to fill vacancies will hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting at which the term of the class to which they have been elected expires. Complete Text of the Proposed Amendment The general description of the proposed amendment to PPG's Articles of Incorporation set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the proposed amendments to the Articles of Incorporation, which are attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement. If the proposal is approved, the Board will make conforming amendments to our Bylaws. ​ ​ ​ 80 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Vote Required The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required for approval of this proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against this proposal. If approved, the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation will become effective upon its filing with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which we intend to do following the Annual Meeting. If this proposal is not approved, the Board will remain classified. ​ THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT OF PPG’S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO PROVIDE FOR THE ANNUAL ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 81 ​ Table of Contents PROPOSAL 4: Proposal to Amend the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to Replace the Supermajority Voting Requirements PPG’s Board of Directors has unanimously approved and is recommending that shareholders approve an amendment to PPG’s Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and PPG’s Amended and Restated Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements set forth therein. In 2014, 2015, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Board considered this proposal, including the amount of shareholder support it received in the past, and proposed to amend PPG’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements with a simple majority vote or the closest standard to a simple majority vote allowed by Pennsylvania law. At our 2014, 2015, 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Meetings, the Board’s proposal to amend PPG’s Articles and Bylaws received the support of the holders of approximately 99% of the votes cast at the meeting but approximately 67%, 68%, 78%, 74% and 78%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. Since PPG’s Articles of Incorporation and certain sections of PPG’s Bylaws require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock to approve a proposal to replace the supermajority voting requirements, the proposals failed to receive the required vote. Considering the recent vote received on this proposal and shareholder opinion on this topic, including our receipt of a shareholder proposal this year, which the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed PPG to exclude from its Proxy Statement due to the inclusion of this Proposal 4 and engagement with the shareholder proponent, the Board is again proposing to amend PPG’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements with a simple majority vote or the closest standard to a simple majority vote allowed by Pennsylvania law. The Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the “Pennsylvania BCL”) generally provides that whenever any corporate action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders of a business corporation, it will be authorized upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon. PPG’s Articles of Incorporation currently require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of PPG’s outstanding common stock entitled to vote for shareholders to approve the following actions: ● repealing the classified board structure; ● changing the size of the Board beyond the parameters set forth in the Articles of Incorporation; ● removing a director from office outside of the annual meeting process; ● amending the provision of the Articles of Incorporation requiring a supermajority vote to approve certain business combinations with a party that owns 20% or more of PPG’s shares; and ● amending the director indemnification provisions. PPG’s Bylaws currently require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of PPG’s outstanding common stock entitled to vote in order for shareholders to approve the following actions: ● repealing the classified board structure; ● removing a director from office outside the annual meeting process; and ● amending the director liability and indemnification provisions. The proposed amendment to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws would reduce the voting requirements for these actions to require a vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote in each circumstance described above other than the business combination provision. The Pennsylvania BCL requires that certain business combinations between PPG and a person who owns 20% or more of PPG’s shares (an interested shareholder) receive the affirmative vote of no less than the majority of the votes cast if the transaction meets certain criteria. However, depending on the form of the transaction, approval may require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of outstanding common stock, excluding the votes of the interested shareholders, or may require the affirmative vote of all of the shares of outstanding common stock. Therefore, the vote required to approve such a transaction would be reduced to the minimum vote required by the Pennsylvania BCL. The Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining the supermajority voting requirements in PPG's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. Proponents of the elimination of supermajority voting requirements posit that these requirements impede accountability to shareholders ​ ​ ​ 82 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents and contribute to Board and management entrenchment. They argue that a minority of shareholders can block an initiative supported by a majority of shareholders and that a simple majority vote requirement should be sufficient for any corporate action requiring shareholder approval. In this regard, the Board gave considerable weight to the fact that the 2014, 2015, 2019, 2020 and 2021 management proposals each received a substantial majority of votes in favor of the proposal and to the opinion of current PPG shareholders on this topic. After carefully reviewing these considerations, the Nominating and Governance Committee determined, and the Board of Directors agreed, that it is in the best interest of PPG to replace the supermajority voting requirements. The Board concluded that replacement of the supermajority voting provisions will both enhance our corporate governance practices and be an effective way to maintain and enhance the accountability of PPG to its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to amend PPG's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements set forth therein. Conforming Changes to PPG's Bylaws PPG's Bylaws also include supermajority voting provisions relating to the repeal of the classified board structure, removal of a director from office outside of the annual meeting process and amendment of the director liability and indemnification provisions that are consistent with the same provisions in the Articles of Incorporation. Conditional upon approval by the shareholders of the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws described in this proposal, PPG's Board has voted to remove the supermajority voting standards from the Bylaws and replace them with a standard requiring the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast and entitled to vote. Complete Text of Proposed Amendment The general description of the proposed amendment to PPG's Articles of Incorporation and the proposed amendment to PPG's Bylaws set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the proposed amendments to the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws, which are attached as Annex C and Annex D, respectively, to this Proxy Statement. Proposed additions are underlined, and proposed deletions are stricken through. Vote Required The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required for approval of this proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against this proposal. If approved, the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation will become effective upon its filing with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which we intend to do following the Annual Meeting. If the proposal is approved, the Board will make conforming amendments to our Bylaws. If this proposal is not approved, the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws will remain unchanged. ​ THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT OF PPG’S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS TO REPLACE THE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING REQUIREMENTS. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 83 ​ Table of Contents INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Service Fees Paid to the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm In 2020 and 2021, we retained PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.

(3) Fees related to tax compliance, planning and advice. (4) Fees related to seminars and the use of accounting research and reporting tools; however, due to rounding, this fee is not represented in 2020. The services performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in 2021 were pre-approved in accordance with the Audit Committee pre-approval policy and procedures adopted at its April 14, 2021 meeting. Additional services were approved during the year as needed, in accordance with this policy. In so doing, the committee determined that the provision of these services is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant’s independence. In 2021, no services were provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that were approved by the committee after such services were performed. Audit Committee Pre-approval Policy The pre-approval policy describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP may perform and lists a range of fees for these services (referred to as the Service List). The services listed in the pre-approval policy are pre-approved by the Audit Committee. If a type of service to be provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is not included in the Service List, the committee must specifically pre-approve it. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings. However, the authority to pre-approve engagements has been delegated to the committee chair to accommodate time sensitive service proposals. Any pre-approval decisions made by the chair must be communicated to the full committee at the next scheduled meeting. ​ ​ ​ ​ 84 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents PROPOSAL 5: Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2022.

The shareholder proposal and the supporting statement are presented exactly as received from the proponent in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we disclaim any responsibility for their content. Shareholder Proposal RESOLVED: Shareholders of PPG Industries, Inc. (the “Company”) request that when setting target amounts for CEO compensation, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors take into consideration the compensation of the Company’s employees and any other workforce that the Compensation Committee determines to be relevant to the Company’s business operations. Compliance with this policy is excused if it will result in the violation of any existing contractual obligation or the terms of any existing compensation plan. SUPPORTING STATEMENT This proposal encourages the Compensation Committee to consider whether the CEO’s compensation is internally aligned with the Company’s compensation practices for its employees as well as the compensation of any other workforce that is relevant to the Company’s business operations. Under this proposal, the Compensation Committee will have discretion to determine how employee and other workforce compensation should influence CEO compensation. This proposal does not require the Compensation Committee to use worker compensation data in a specific way to set CEO compensation. Rather, it is a suggested enhancement to the Compensation Committee’s process for setting target amounts for the CEO’s compensation. Under this proposal, how the Compensation Committee would consider employee compensation and other workforce compensation is within its discretion. The Compensation Committee also will retain authority to consider any other information when setting CEO compensation targets. This proposal provides flexibility to consider the compensation of any other workforce that the Compensation Committee determines to be relevant to the Company’s business operations. For example, our Company has developed customer-facing digital technology platforms such as PPG Services for commercial businesses and Paintzen for residential customers. We believe that the workforces employed via these platforms are a material part of the Company’s value chain and therefore the compensation of these workforces is relevant information. Like at many companies, our Company’s Compensation Committee has used a peer group of what other companies pay their CEOs to set its target CEO pay. Over time, using peer group benchmarks as the primary measure to set CEO compensation targets can lead to pay inflation. Although many companies target CEO compensation at the median of their peer group, certain companies have targeted their CEO’s pay above median. In addition, peer groups can be cherry­ picked to include larger or more successful companies where CEO compensation is higher. To ensure that our Company’s CEO compensation is reasonable relative to our Company's overall compensation philosophy and structure, we believe that the Compensation Committee should also consider the compensation of Company employees and other relevant workforces when setting CEO compensation. We note that in 2020, the Company's median employee compensation was $43,783 and the Company’s CEO to median employee pay ratio was 363:1. For those reasons, we urge you to vote in favor of this proposal. Board of Directors’ Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal After careful consideration, and for the reasons set forth below, PPG’s Board of Directors does not believe that approval of the proposed resolution is in the best interests of PPG . Our established compensation principles promote fair and reasonable practices aligned with the creation of long-term shareholder value. We believe that PPG’s executive compensation program strikes the appropriate balance between effectively incentivizing our executives based on performance and utilizing responsible and market-driven competitive pay practices in order that our executives dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our shareholders. In keeping with this philosophy, 90% of our Chief Executive Officer’s 2021 target compensation was performance based. As described in detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, the primary objectives of our executive compensation policies are to: ​ ​ ​ 86 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents ● Attract and retain executive officers by offering total compensation that is competitive with that offered by similarly situated companies and rewarding outstanding personal performance; ● Promote and reward the achievement of short-term objectives that our Board of Directors and management believe will lead to long-term growth in shareholder value; and ● Closely align the interests of executive officers with those of our shareholders by making long-term incentive compensation dependent upon the Company’s financial performance and total shareholder return. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement provides extensive information about the factors that the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee considers when designing the elements of our executive compensation program, the process followed by the committee in setting the target compensation for the Company’s executive officers and the specific elements that resulted in the compensation paid to each of our named executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer. In addition, our compensation principles are intended to ensure that our compensation practices are fair and reasonable as applied to all PPG employees. At all levels of our organization, we seek to balance both individual and Company-wide performance and to provide competitive wages and benefits to all employees based on their roles, responsibilities, skills, performance and location. To monitor and support the effectiveness of this program, PPG annually compares its pay components to those of other companies relevant to PPG, and we annually adjust our compensation as necessary to stay competitive and attract, retain, and motivate a highly qualified, diverse workforce at all levels throughout the organization, not just for our executive officers. In its supporting statement, the proponent requests that special consideration be given to the workforces associated with PPG’s Paintzen and PPG Services businesses. These businesses do not employ their own workforces, and the sales of these businesses are less than 1% of PPG’s total sales and are immaterial to PPG as a whole. The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee values and carefully considers the feedback that we receive from our shareholders regarding our executive compensation programs. Our shareholder outreach efforts included engaging with shareholders collectively representing approximately 60% of our outstanding shares and hearing from shareholders their perspectives on our executive compensation program. Approximately 91% of the votes cast on the Company’s 2021 say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in last year’s Proxy Statement, and PPG’s say-on-pay proposal has been approved by more than 90% of the votes cast every year it has appeared on the ballot. Based on this feedback, the Board of Directors believes that the overwhelming majority of our shareholders support the Company’s executive compensation program. The Board believes that the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee already follows a thoughtful and deliberate approach in making executive compensation decisions and has access to meaningful information about our broad-based compensation practices. Given this approach, the Board believes that mandating that the Committee consider the required information would not significantly aid or improve the process already followed by the Committee. Vote Required Adoption of the shareholder proposal requesting that when setting target amounts for Chief Executive Officer compensation, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee take into consideration the compensation of the Company’s employees and any other workforce that the committee determines to be relevant to the Company’s business operations will require the affirmative vote of more than one half of the shares present, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote and voting (excluding abstentions) at the Annual Meeting. THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE AGAINST THIS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL IF IT IS PROPERLY PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 87 ​ Table of Contents EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION The following table provides information as of December 31, 2021 regarding the number of shares of PPG common stock that may be issued under PPG’s equity compensation plans: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NUMBER OF SECURITIES ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ REMAINING AVAILABLE FOR ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ FUTURE ISSUANCE ​ ​ NUMBER OF SECURITIES ​ WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ​ UNDER EQUITY ​ ​ TO BE ISSUED UPON EXERCISE ​ EXERCISE PRICE OF ​ COMPENSATION PLANS ​ ​ OF OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, ​ OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, ​ (EXCLUDING SECURITIES ​ ​ WARRANTS AND RIGHTS ​ WARRANTS AND RIGHTS ​ REFLECTED IN COLUMN (A)) PLAN CATEGORY ​ (A) ​ (B) ​ (C) (2) Equity compensation plans approved by security holders (1) 3,784,542 ​ $ 110.98 ​ 8,993,763 Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders (3) — ​ $ — — Total 3,784,542 ​ $ 110.98 ​ 8,993,763 (1) All securities were granted under the PPG Industries, Inc.

(2) Shares of common stock considered to be “beneficially owned” include both common stock actually owned and shares of common stock as to which there is a right to acquire ownership on, or within 60 days after, February 18, 2022. These amounts reflect shares subject to options exercisable within 60 days of February 18, 2022: as follows: Mr. McGarry, 448,816; Ms. Foulkes, 21,757; Mr. Knavish, 19,614; Ms. Liebert, 30,086; and Mr. Morales, 61,231.

In April 2021, each director received 947 time-based restricted stock units. The directors’ restricted stock units granted in 2021 vest on April 20, 2022 and are not included in the table because these restricted stock units do not vest within 60 days of February 18, 2022. To the Company’s knowledge, none of the shares reflected in the table have been pledged. (3) Certain directors hold common stock equivalents in their accounts in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, which is described under “Deferred Compensation.” Certain executive officers hold common stock equivalents in their accounts in the Deferred Compensation Plan, which is described under “PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan.” Common stock equivalents are hypothetical shares of common stock having a value on any given date equal to the value of a share of common stock. Common stock equivalents earn dividend equivalents that are converted into additional common stock equivalents, but carry no voting rights or other rights afforded to a holder of common stock. Upon leaving the Company, the common stock equivalents are made available for distribution, and all distributions are made in the form of one share of PPG common stock for each common stock equivalent credited to the person’s deferred account. (4) This is the sum of the beneficially owned common stock and the common stock equivalents as shown in the previous two columns. None of the identified beneficial owners holds more than 1.0% of the voting securities of PPG outstanding. The beneficial owners as a group hold less than 1.0% of the voting securities of PPG outstanding. (5) The group consists of 19 persons: the directors and executive officers named in this Proxy Statement and PPG’s remaining executive officers: Ms. Amy R. Ericson and Mr. Ram Vadlamannati. ​ ​ ​ ​ 90 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents DELINQUENT SECTION 16(a) REPORTS The directors and Section 16 officers of PPG are required to file reports of initial ownership and changes of ownership of PPG securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. As a practical matter, PPG assists its directors and Section 16 officers by monitoring transactions and completing and filing such reports on their behalf. To PPG's knowledge, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the required filings of all such directors and Section 16 officers were timely filed, except for the filing by the Company of one Form 4 on behalf of Brian R. Williams, PPG's Vice President and Controller, reporting one transaction one day late due to an administrative error. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 91 ​ Table of Contents ​ GENERAL MATTERS When and where is the Annual Meeting? The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, April 21, 2022, at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at https://www.cesonlineservices.com/ppg22_vm. This year’s Annual Meeting will be a virtual shareholders meeting held via the Internet. There will be no physical location for in-person attendance at the Annual Meeting. Why am I receiving these proxy materials? In connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors to be voted at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, these materials have been made available to you on the Internet or, upon your request or under certain other circumstances, have been delivered to you by mail in printed form. If your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, as of the close of business on February 18, 2022, you are considered a shareholder of record, and we have sent you these proxy materials. If your shares were held in the name of a bank, brokerage account or other nominee as of the close of business on February 18, 2022, you are considered a beneficial owner of the shares held in street name. Your bank, broker or other nominee has sent you these proxy materials. You should direct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares, and we encourage you to make such direction. If you do not make a direction with respect to Proposals 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6, your bank, broker or other nominee will not be able to vote your shares on your behalf with respect to such proposals. What is included in these materials? These proxy materials include: ● Our Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement for the 2022 Annual Meeting; and ● Our 2021 Annual Report to shareholders, which includes our audited consolidated financial statements. If you received printed versions of these materials by mail, these materials also include the proxy card or vote instruction form for the Annual Meeting. Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of printed proxy materials? In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to our shareholders, we have elected to furnish these materials by providing access to these documents over the Internet. Accordingly, on or about March 10, 2022, we sent a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (“Notice of Internet Availability”) to our shareholders of record and beneficial owners. All shareholders have the ability to access the proxy materials on a website referred to in the Notice of Internet Availability. What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials? It means you have multiple accounts at the transfer agent or with banks, brokers or other nominees. If you received more than one Notice of Internet Availability, you may need to enter separate electronic control voting numbers when voting by the Internet to ensure that all of your shares have been voted. If you received more than one proxy card or vote instruction form, please complete and provide your voting instructions for all proxy cards and vote instruction forms that you receive. How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials? The Notice of Internet Availability provides you with instructions regarding how to (1) view our proxy materials for the Annual Meeting on the Internet; (2) vote your shares after you have viewed our proxy materials; and (3) request a printed copy of the proxy materials. Our proxy materials are also available online at investor.ppg.com. ​ ​ ​ 92 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents What am I voting on? You are voting on six proposals.

What are my choices when voting? ● Proposal 1: You may cast your vote in favor of or against election of each of the nominees or you may elect to abstain from voting your shares. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be taken into account to determine the outcome of the election of directors. ● Proposals 2, 5 and 6: You may cast your vote in favor of or against each proposal, or you may elect to abstain from voting your shares. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. ● Proposals 3 and 4: You may cast your vote in favor of or against each proposal, or you may elect to abstain from voting your shares. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against these proposals. What vote is needed for the proposals to be adopted? As of the record date, February 18, 2022, there were 236,148,121 shares of PPG common stock issued and outstanding. Each shareholder is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held. ● Quorum: In order to conduct the Annual Meeting, more than one-half of the outstanding shares must be present or be represented by proxy. This is referred to as a quorum. If you vote by Internet or by telephone, or submit a properly executed proxy card or vote instruction form, you will be considered part of the quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes on any proposal to be acted on by shareholders will be treated as present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of a quorum. ● Proposal 1: Each director nominee who receives a majority of the votes cast (the number of shares voted “for” the director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director) at the Annual Meeting will be elected as a director. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 93 ​ Table of Contents ● Proposal 2: More than one-half of the shares present, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote and voting (excluding abstentions) at the Annual Meeting must vote for the proposal for it to be adopted. The advisory vote on this proposal is nonbinding. However, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote on this proposal when making future decisions about the Company's executive compensation arrangements, policies and procedures. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. ● Proposals 3 and 4: At least 80% of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must vote for the proposals for them to be adopted. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against these proposals. ● Proposals 5 and 6: More than one-half of the shares present, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote and voting (excluding abstentions) at the Annual Meeting must vote for the proposal for it to be adopted. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. How do I vote? You may vote your shares by any one of the following methods: ● By Internet: Log onto the website indicated in the Notice of Internet Availability or on the proxy card or vote instruction form. ● By telephone: Call the toll-free number shown on the proxy card or vote instruction form and follow the voice prompts. ● By mail: Mark your votes, sign and return the proxy card or vote instruction form in the postage-paid envelope provided. ● By ballot: Attend the Annual Meeting virtually and vote online during the meeting. If you vote by the Internet or by telephone, you do not need to send in a proxy card or vote instruction form. The deadline for Internet and telephone voting will be 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 20, 2022. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, and you wish to vote your shares online while attending the virtual Annual Meeting, you will need to contact your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a legal proxy form that you must submit to Corporate Election Services when you register to attend the meeting. What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions? The Board of Directors is asking for your proxy. Giving us your proxy means that you authorize us to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting in the manner you direct. If you (1) choose the “submit your vote” option without voting on each individual proposal when voting on the Internet or by telephone or (2) if you are a shareholder of record and sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then your shares will be voted in the manner recommended by our Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement. If your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, the broker, bank or nominee will ask you how you want to vote your shares. If you give the broker, bank or nominee instructions, your shares will be voted as you direct. If you do not give instructions, your broker, bank or nominee may vote your shares in its discretion for the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2022 (Proposal 5), but your broker, bank or nominee will not vote your shares at all with respect to any of the other proposals. We encourage you to provide instructions to your bank, broker or nominee by carefully following the instructions provided. This will ensure that your shares are voted at the Annual Meeting as you direct. How can I change or revoke my vote after I have voted? You have the right to change your vote or revoke your proxy before it is exercised at the Annual Meeting. You may vote again on a later date on the Internet or by telephone (only your latest Internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted), by signing and returning a new proxy card or vote instruction form with a later date, or by attending the virtual Annual Meeting and voting online during the meeting. However, your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote again at the Annual Meeting or specifically request in writing that your prior proxy be revoked. Please note that any re-votes by mail or proxy revocations must be received by our corporate secretary at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272 prior to the Annual Meeting in order to be effective. ​ ​ ​ 94 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents How will shares in employee benefit plans be voted? This Proxy Statement is being used to solicit voting instructions from you with respect to shares of PPG common stock that you own, but which are held by the trustees of a retirement or savings plan for the benefit of you and other plan participants. Shares held in the benefit plans that are entitled to vote will be voted by the trustees pursuant to your instructions. Shares held in any employee benefit plan that you are entitled to vote, but do not vote, will not be voted by the trustees.

Substantially similar questions will be answered once to avoid repetition and allow more time for other questions. Questions pertinent to meeting matters will be answered during the Annual Meeting, subject to time constraints. If there are questions pertinent to meeting matters that are not answered during the meeting due to time constraints, management will post answers to a representative set of such questions on our ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 95 ​ Table of Contents Investor Relations website at investor.ppg.com. These questions and answers will be available as soon as practicable after the meeting. How do I obtain a copy of materials related to corporate governance? Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, charters of each standing committee of our Board of Directors, Global Code of Ethics, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and other materials related to our corporate governance are published on the Corporate Governance section of our website at investor.ppg.com. Who is soliciting my vote and what are the solicitation expenses? This solicitation is being made on behalf of our Board of Directors, but may also be made without additional compensation by our directors, officers or employees by telephone, facsimile, e-mail or personal interview. We will bear the expense of the preparation, printing and mailing of the Notice of Internet Availability and these proxy materials. We have hired D.F. King & Company to help us send out the proxy materials and to solicit proxies for the Annual Meeting, the estimated cost of which is approximately $300,000 plus reimbursement of certain additional out of pocket expenses. We will request brokers, banks and other nominees who hold shares of PPG common stock in their names to furnish proxy materials to beneficial owners of the shares. We will reimburse these brokers, banks and nominees for their reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. How can I submit a proposal for consideration at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders? To be considered for the 2023 Annual Meeting, shareholder proposals must be submitted in writing to our corporate secretary at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272. No proposal can be included in our Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting unless it is received by our corporate secretary no later than November 10, 2022. The proposal must also comply with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to shareholder proposals. Any shareholder whose proposal is not included in our Proxy Statement relating to the 2023 Annual Meeting and who intends to present business for consideration at the 2023 Annual Meeting must give notice to our corporate secretary in accordance with Section 1.5 of our Bylaws (which are available on the Corporate Governance section of our website at investor.ppg.com) and such business must otherwise be a proper matter for shareholder action. If, as expected, the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is held on April 20, 2023, then the notice must be received by our corporate secretary on or before January 20, 2023. How can I recommend someone as a candidate for director? A shareholder who wishes to recommend or nominate a candidate for director of PPG may write to the chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, in care of our corporate secretary at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272. To be effective for consideration at the 2023 Annual Meeting, the recommendation or nomination must be received by our corporate secretary by the deadlines set forth in our Bylaws and must include information required under our Bylaws, including information about the nominating shareholder and information about the nominee that would be required to be included in a Proxy Statement under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Director nominations submitted pursuant to PPG’s proxy access Bylaw for consideration at the 2023 Annual Meeting must be received by PPG no earlier than October 11, 2022 and no later than November 10, 2022. For additional information regarding the nomination procedure, see “Corporate Governance—Shareholder Recommendations or Nominations for Director and Proxy Access.” ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 96 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents OTHER INFORMATION Householding Information PPG and some banks, brokers and other nominees are participating in the practice of “householding” proxy materials.

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania March 10, 2022 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement 97 ​ Table of Contents ANNEX A RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PPG believes investor’s understanding of the Company’s performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations adjusted for certain items. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the Company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and should not be considered a substitute for net income and earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies. Net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) and earnings per share – assuming dilution (attributable to PPG) are reconciled to adjusted net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) and adjusted earnings per share – assuming dilution below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 ​ 2020 ​ 2019 ​ 2018 ​ 2017 FOR THE YEAR-ENDED ​ NET INCOME ​ NET INCOME ​ NET INCOME ​ NET INCOME ​ NET INCOME (MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) $ EPS (1) $ EPS (1) $ EPS (1) $ EPS (1) $ EPS (1) Net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) ​ $ 1,420 ​ $ 5.93 ​ $ 1,056 ​ $ 4.44 ​ $ 1,243 ​ $ 5.22 ​ $ 1,323 ​ $ 5.40 ​ $ 1,369 ​ $ 5.31 Acquisition-related amortization expense (2) ​ 130 ​ ​ 0.55 ​ 99 ​ ​ 0.42 ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ — Acquisition-related costs, net (3) ​ ​ 69 ​ ​ 0.29 ​ ​ 7 ​ ​ 0.03 ​ ​ 13 ​ ​ 0.05 ​ ​ 4 ​ ​ 0.02 ​ ​ 6 ​ ​ 0.02 Pension settlement charges ​ ​ 36 ​ ​ 0.15 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 38 ​ ​ 0.14 Net charges related to environmental remediation and other costs ​ ​ 26 ​ ​ 0.11 ​ ​ 19 ​ ​ 0.08 ​ ​ 47 ​ ​ 0.20 ​ ​ 58 ​ ​ 0.24 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — Net tax charge related to UK statutory rate change ​ ​ 22 ​ ​ 0.09 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — Net charges related to business restructuring-related costs (4) ​ 20 ​ ​ 0.08 ​ 166 ​ ​ 0.70 ​ 168 ​ ​ 0.71 ​ 53 ​ ​ 0.21 ​ — ​ — Expenses incurred due to natural disasters ​ ​ 13 ​ ​ 0.06 ​ ​ 13 ​ ​ 0.06 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — Charges related to asset impairments ​ ​ 12 ​ ​ 0.05 ​ ​ 64 ​ ​ 0.27 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 11 ​ ​ 0.05 ​ ​ 7 ​ ​ 0.03 Change in allowance for doubtful accounts related to COVID-19 ​ (11) ​ ​ (0.05) ​ 23 ​ ​ 0.10 ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ — Income from legal settlements ​ (17) ​ ​ (0.07) ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ — Asbestos-related claims reserve adjustment (5) ​ ​ (101) ​ ​ (0.42) ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 9 ​ ​ 0.04 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — Charge related to early retirement of debt ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 5 ​ ​ 0.02 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — Net charges related to litigation matters ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 19 ​ ​ 0.08 ​ ​ (11) ​ ​ (0.04) Net tax (benefit)/charge related to U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ (13) ​ ​ (0.05) ​ ​ 134 ​ ​ 0.52 Gains from the sale of non-operating assets ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ (20) ​ ​ (0.08) ​ (8) ​ (0.03) Charges related to a customer assortment change ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 14 ​ ​ 0.05 ​ — ​ — Gain from sale of business ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ — ​ ​ — ​ (24) ​ (0.09) Adjusted net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) ​ $ 1,619 ​ ​ 6.77 ​ $ 1,452 ​ ​ 6.12 ​ $ 1,480 ​ ​ 6.22 ​ $ 1,449 ​ ​ 5.92 ​ $ 1,511 ​ $ 5.86 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (1) Earnings per diluted share is calculated based on unrounded numbers.

Section 1.4 Inclusion of Shareholder Director Nominations in the Corporation’s Proxy Materials .  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these bylaws, the Corporation shall include in its proxy materials for a meeting of shareholders, provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such a meeting, the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any person nominated for election (the “Shareholder Nominee”) to the Board of Directors by a shareholder or group of shareholders that satisfy the C ​ ​ ​ 2022 Proxy Statement D - 3 ​ Table of Contents requirements of this Section 1.4, including qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder (as defined in paragraph (d) below), and that expressly elects at the time of providing the written notice required by this Section 1.4 (a “Proxy Access Notice”) to have its nominee included in the Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 1.4.

The number of shares calculated in accordance with the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall be deemed not to include (and to the extent any of the following arrangements have been entered into by affiliates of the shareholder (or of any Constituent Holder), shall be reduced by) any shares (x) sold by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (y) borrowed by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) for any purposes or purchased by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) pursuant to an agreement to resell, or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates), whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of Voting Stock, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised by either party thereto would have, the purpose or effect of (i) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such shareholder's or Constituent Holder’s (or either’s affiliate’s) full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (ii) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or either’s affiliate), other than any such arrangements solely involving an exchange listed multi-industry market index fund in which Voting Stock represents at the time of entry into such arrangement less than 10% of the proportionate value of such index.  A shareholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall “own” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the shareholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of Directors and the right to direct the disposition thereof and possesses the full economic interest in the shares.  A shareholder’s (including any Constituent Holder’s) ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which such person has loaned such shares so long as such person has the retained the power to recall such shares at any time by the shareholder upon giving requisite notice or delegated any voting power over such shares by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement which in all such cases of such proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement is revocable at any time by the shareholder.  The terms “owned,” “owning” and other variations of the word “own” shall have correlative meanings.

The Corporation shall also include the name of the Shareholder Nominee in its proxy card.  For the avoidance of doubt, and any other provision of these bylaws notwithstanding, the Corporation may in its sole discretion solicit against, and include in the proxy statement its own statements or other information relating to, any Eligible Shareholder and/or Shareholder Nominee, including any information provided to the Corporation with respect to the foregoing. ​ ​ ​ D - 4 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents (b) To be timely, a shareholder’s Proxy Access Notice must be delivered to the principal executive offices of the Corporation not more than 150 days and not less than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the date (as stated in the Corporation’s proxy materials) the definitive proxy statement was first mailed to shareholders in connection with the preceding year’s annual meeting of shareholders.  In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, the date of which has been announced by the Corporation, commence a new time period for the giving of a Proxy Access Notice. (c) The number of Shareholder Nominees (including Shareholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Shareholder for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 1.4 but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the Board of Directors decides to nominate as Board of Directors’ nominees) appearing in the Corporation’s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of shareholders shall not exceed the greater of (x) two and (y) the largest whole number that does not exceed 20% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.4 (such greater number, the “Permitted Number”); provided, however, that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by: (i)         the number of such director candidates for which the Corporation shall have received one or more shareholder notices nominating director candidates pursuant to Section 1.3(b) of these bylaws plus the number of directors in office that were elected to the Board after being nominated at any of the two preceding annual meetings pursuant to such Section 1.3(b); (ii)         the number of directors in office or director candidates that in either case were elected or appointed to the Board or will be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting as an unopposed (by the Corporation) nominee pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or other understanding with a shareholder or group of shareholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of Voting Stock, by such shareholder or group of shareholders, from the Corporation), other than any such director referred to in this clause (ii) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board of Directors, for at least one full three-year term, but only to the extent the Permitted Number after such reduction with respect to this clause (ii) equals or exceeds one; and (iii) the number of directors in office for whom access to the Corporation’s proxy materials was previously provided (or requested) pursuant to this Section 1.4, other than (A)  any such director referred to in this clause (iii) whose term of office will expire at such annual meeting and who is not seeking (or agreeing) to be nominated at such meeting for another term of office and (B) any such director referred to in this clause (iii) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board of Directors, for at least one full three-year term; provided, that in no circumstance shall the Permitted Number exceed the number of directors to be elected at the applicable annual meeting as noticed by the Corporation; and provided, further, that in the event the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors effective on or prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced.  In the event that the number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.4 exceeds the Permitted Number, each Eligible Shareholder will promptly upon request of the Corporation select one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of Voting Stock each Eligible Shareholder disclosed as owned in its Proxy Access Notice submitted to the Corporation.  If the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Shareholder has selected one (1) Shareholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached. (d) An “Eligible Shareholder” is one or more shareholders of record who own and have owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own and have owned (in each case as defined above), in each case continuously for at least three (3) years as of both the date that the Proxy Access Notice is received by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 1.4, and as of the record date for determining shareholders eligible to vote at the annual meeting, at least three percent (3%) of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock (the “Proxy Access Request Required Shares”), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is received by the Corporation and the date of the applicable annual meeting, provided that the aggregate number of shareholders, and, if and to the extent that a shareholder is acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners, of such beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed twenty (20).

No shares may be attributed to more than one group constituting an Eligible Shareholder under this Section 1.4 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no shareholder may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Shareholder).  A record holder acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a shareholder with respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (d), for purposes of determining the number of shareholders whose holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Shareholder’s holdings.  For the avoidance of doubt, Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such if and only if the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy Access Notice has itself individually beneficially owned such shares continuously for the three-year (3 year) period ending on that date and through the other applicable dates referred to above (in addition to the other applicable requirements being met).

(C)         has not engaged and will not engage in, and has not and will not be a “participant” in another person’s, “solicitation” within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the annual meeting other than its Shareholder Nominee(s) or a nominee of the Board of Directors; (D)         will not distribute to any shareholder any form of proxy for the annual meeting other than the form distributed by the Corporation; and (E)         will provide facts, statements and other information in all communications with the Corporation and its shareholders that are and will be true and correct in all material respects and do not and will not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will otherwise comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this Section 1.4;

In order to be considered timely, any information required by this Section 1.4 to be provided to the Corporation must be supplemented (by delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation) (1) no later than ten (10) days following the record date for the applicable annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of such record date, and (2) no later than the fifth day before the annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of the date that is no earlier than ten (10) days prior to such annual meeting.  For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement to update and supplement such information shall not permit any Eligible Shareholder or other person to change or add any proposed Shareholder Nominee or be deemed to cure any defects or limit the remedies (including without limitation under these bylaws) available to the Corporation relating to any defect. (f) The Eligible Shareholder may provide to the Secretary of the Corporation, at the time the information required by this Section 1.4 is originally provided, a written statement for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy statement for the annual meeting, not to exceed five hundred (500) words, in support of the candidacy of such Eligible Shareholder’s Shareholder Nominee (the “Statement”).

(h) Any Shareholder Nominee who is included in the Corporation’s proxy statement for a particular annual meeting of shareholders, but subsequently is determined not to satisfy the eligibility requirements of this Section 1.4 or any other provision of these bylaws, the Corporation’s Restated Articles of Incorporation or other applicable regulation any time before the annual meeting of shareholders, will not be eligible for election at the relevant annual meeting of shareholders. (i) The Corporation shall not be required to include, pursuant to this Section 1.4, a Shareholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any annual meeting of shareholders, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, to allow the nomination of a Shareholder Nominee, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation: (i)         who is not independent under the listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the Corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the Board of Directors in determining and disclosing independence of the Corporation’s directors, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors; (ii)         whose service as a member of the Board of Directors would violate or cause the Corporation to be in violation of these bylaws, the Restated Articles of Incorporation, the rules and listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the Corporation is traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation; (iii)         if the Eligible Shareholder (or any Constituent Holder) or applicable Shareholder Nominee otherwise breaches or fails to comply in any material respect with its obligations pursuant to this Section 1.4 or any agreement, representation or undertaking required by this Section; or (iv)         if the Eligible Shareholder ceases to be an Eligible Shareholder for any reason, including but not limited to not owning the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the date of the applicable annual meeting. For the purposes of this paragraph (i), clauses (i) and (ii) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by the Shareholder Nominee, clause (iii) will result in the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this Section 1.4 of the specific Shareholder Nominee to whom the ineligibility applies, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, the ineligibility of such Shareholder Nominee to be nominated; provided, however, that clause (iv) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by an Eligible Shareholder (or any Constituent Holder), clause (iii) will result in the Voting Stock owned by such Eligible Shareholder (or Constituent Holder) being excluded from the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (and, if as a result the Proxy Access Notice shall no longer have been filed by an Eligible Shareholder, the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this Section 1.4 of all of the applicable shareholder’s Shareholder Nominees from the applicable annual meeting of shareholders or, if the proxy statement has already been filed, the ineligibility of all of such shareholder’s Shareholder Nominees to be nominated). ​ ​ ​ D - 8 2022 Proxy Statement ​ ​ Table of Contents Section 1.5 Other Matters Brought by Shareholders .

Where a proxy or proxies represent the holders of shares entitled to cast in aggregate a sufficient number of votes to adopt a particular resolution, the vote of such proxy or proxies may, in the discretion of the presiding officer, constitute action by the shareholders.

(c) “Referee” means an attorney with substantial expertise in corporate law who neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent:  (i) the Corporation or the Indemnitee, or an affiliate of either of them, in any matter material to either such party, except to act as a Referee in similar proceedings, or (ii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this Article.

The General Counsel or a senior officer shall be deemed “Disinterested” if not a party to the Proceeding and not alleged in the pleadings as to the Proceeding to have participated in the action, or participated in the failure to act, which is the basis for the relief sought in the Proceeding. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, to the extent that there has been a determination by a court as to the conduct of an Indemnitee such that indemnification would not be prohibited by Pennsylvania law, or if an Indemnitee would be entitled by Pennsylvania law to indemnification, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder. (e) A determination under this Section 6.3 shall be conclusive and binding on the Corporation but not on the Indemnitee. Section 6.4 Partial Indemnification .
