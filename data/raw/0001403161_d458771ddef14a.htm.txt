enhance stockholder value while avoiding excessive risk-taking. Principles of our Compensation Programs Pay for Performance The key principle of our compensation philosophy is pay for performance. Alignment with Stockholders’ Interests We reward performance that meets or exceeds the performance goals that the Compensation Committee establishes with the objective of increasing
stockholder value. Variation Based on Performance We favor variable pay opportunities that are based on performance over fixed pay. The total compensation
received by our named executive officers varies based on corporate and individual performance measured against annual and long-term goals. We maintain compensation plans that tie a substantial portion of our named executive officers’ overall target
annual compensation to the achievement of our corporate performance goals. The Compensation Committee employs multiple performance measures and strives to award an appropriate mix of annual and long-term equity incentives to avoid overweighting
short-term objectives. 3 Table of Contents Key Elements of our Compensation Programs

In 2017, under the leadership of our
new CEO, Alfred F. Kelly, Jr., Visa made several changes to the existing strategic framework. The strategic pillars were reframed as ‘foundational pillars’ – fundamental to maintaining Visa’s operational excellence and
reputation as a trusted leader in the industry – and ‘growth pillars’ – critical for driving long-term sustained growth in a rapidly evolving landscape. A new strategic pillar, Leverage World-Class Brand, was
added to highlight the importance of maximizing Visa’s brand to drive measurable outcomes for Visa and our partners. Our commitment to develop the best talent was placed at the center of the strategic framework, to reinforce how attracting,
developing and retaining the best people globally is crucial to all aspects of Visa’s activities and long-term success. The Board and
management routinely confer on our Company’s execution of its long-term strategic plans, the status of key strategic initiatives and the key strategic opportunities and risks facing Visa. In addition, the Board periodically devotes meetings to
conduct an in-depth long-term strategic review with our Company’s senior management team. During these reviews, the Board and management discuss the payments landscape, emerging technological and
competitive threats, and short and long-term plans and priorities within each strategic pillar. Additionally, the Board annually discusses and
approves the Company’s budget and capital requests, which are firmly linked to Visa’s long-term strategic plans and priorities. Through these processes, the Board brings its collective, independent judgment to bear on the most critical
long-term strategic issues facing Visa. For more information on our long-term strategy and the progress we made against our strategic goals in fiscal 2017, please see our 2017 Annual Report, including the letter from our CEO, Alfred F. Kelly, Jr.,
to our stockholders. Strategic Framework 6 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Our Board oversees the business of the Company to serve the long-term interests of our stockholders. Members of our Board oversee our business through
discussions with our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Vice Chairman and Chief Risk Officer and other officers and employees, and by reviewing materials provided to them and participating in regular
meetings of the Board and its committees. The Board regularly monitors our corporate governance policies and profile to ensure we meet or exceed
the requirements of applicable laws, regulations and rules, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We have instituted a variety of practices to foster and maintain responsible corporate governance, which are described in
this section. To learn more about Visa’s corporate governance and to view our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, and the charters of each of the Board’s
committees, please visit the Investor Relations page of our website at http://investor.visa.com under “Corporate Governance.” Copies of these documents also are available in print free of charge by writing to our Corporate Secretary
at Visa Inc., P.O. Box 193243, San Francisco, CA 94119. Board Leadership Structure In October 2016, the Board appointed Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. as Chief Executive Officer, effective December 1, 2016, replacing Charles W. Scharf, who
resigned as Chief Executive Officer effective December 1, 2016. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board believe having the Chair and Chief Executive Officer in separate roles is the most appropriate leadership structure
for the Company at this time, by allowing Mr. Kelly to focus on the day-to-day management of the business and on executing our strategic priorities, while allowing
our independent Chair, Robert W. Matschullat, to focus on leading the Board, providing advice and counsel to Mr. Kelly and facilitating the Board’s independent oversight of management. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will
continue to periodically review the Board’s leadership structure and to exercise its discretion in recommending an appropriate and effective framework on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the needs of the Board and the Company at such time. As our independent Chair, Mr. Matschullat’s duties and responsibilities include: presiding at meetings of the Board and calling, setting the
agenda for and chairing periodic executive sessions of the independent directors; providing feedback to the Chief Executive Officer on corporate policies and strategies; acting as a liaison between the Board and the Chief Executive Officer; and
facilitating one-on-one communication between directors, committee chairs, the Chief Executive Officer and other senior managers to keep abreast of their perspectives. In addition to our independent Chair, the Board has three standing committees: the Audit and Risk Committee, chaired by Mary B. Cranston; the
Compensation Committee, chaired by Suzanne Nora Johnson; and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, chaired by John A.C. Swainson. In their capacities as independent committee chairs, Ms. Cranston, Ms. Nora Johnson and
Mr. Swainson each have responsibilities that contribute to the Board’s oversight of management, as well as facilitating communication among the Board and management. Board of Directors and Committee Evaluations Our Board and each of our committees conduct an annual evaluation, which includes a qualitative assessment by each director of the performance of the
Board and the committee or committees on which the director sits. The Board also conducts an annual peer review, which is designed to assess individual director performance. The evaluations and peer review are conducted via oral interviews by an
independent, third party legal advisor selected by the Board, using as the basis for discussion a list of questions that are provided to each director in advance. The results of the evaluation and any recommendations for improvement are discussed
with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the evaluation process. 7 Table of Contents Over the past few years, the evaluation process has led to a broader scope of topics covered in the
board meetings and improvements in board process. These improvements include changes relating to the preparation and distribution of board materials, as well as adjustments to the timing and location of board and committee meetings. The process has
also informed board and committee composition, which includes changes to the director candidate skills and qualifications criteria. Director Succession Planning and Board Refreshment In addition to executive and management succession, the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee regularly oversees and plans for director succession and refreshment of the Board to ensure a mix of skills, experience, tenure, and diversity that promote and support the Company’s long-term strategy. In doing so, the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into consideration the overall needs, composition and size of the Board, as well as the criteria adopted by the Board regarding director candidate qualifications, which are described in the section
entitled Corporate Governance – Nomination of Directors . Individuals identified by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as qualified to become directors are then recommended to the Board for nomination or
election. Independence of Directors The NYSE’s listing standards and our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a majority of our Board and every member of the Audit and Risk,
Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees must be “independent.” Our Certificate of Incorporation further requires that at least fifty-eight percent (58%) of our Board be independent. Under the NYSE’s
listing standards, our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Certificate of Incorporation, no director will be considered to be independent unless our Board affirmatively determines that such director has no direct or indirect material
relationship with Visa or our management. Our Board reviews the independence of its members annually and has adopted guidelines to assist it in making its independence determinations. For details, see our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which can
be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at http://investor.visa.com under “Corporate Governance.” In October 2017,
with the assistance of legal counsel, our Board conducted its annual review of director independence and affirmatively determined that each of our non-employee directors (Lloyd A. Carney, Mary
B. Cranston, Francisco Javier Fernández-Carbajal, Gary A. Hoffman, Suzanne Nora Johnson, John F. Lundgren, Robert W. Matschullat, John A. C. Swainson and Maynard G. Webb, Jr.) is “independent” as that term is defined in the
NYSE’s listing standards, our independence guidelines and our Certificate of Incorporation. In addition, the Board previously determined that Cathy E. Minehan and David J. Pang were “independent” while they served on the Board during
fiscal 2017. In making the determination that the directors listed above are independent, the Board considered relevant transactions, relationships
and arrangements, including those specified in the NYSE listing standards and our independence guidelines, and determined that these relationships were not material relationships that would impair the director’s independence. In this regard,
the Board considered that certain directors serve as directors of other companies with which the Company engages in ordinary-course-of-business transactions, and that,
in accordance with our director independence guidelines, none of these relationships constitute material relationships that would impair the independence of these individuals. Discretionary contributions to certain charitable organizations with
which some of our directors are affiliated also were considered, and the Board determined that the amounts contributed to each of these charitable organizations in the past fiscal year were less than $120,000 and that these contributions otherwise
created no material relationships that would impair the independence of those individuals. In addition, each member of the Audit and Risk Committee
and the Compensation Committee meets the additional, heightened independence criteria applicable to such committee members under the applicable NYSE rules. 8 Table of Contents Executive Sessions of the Board of Directors The non-employee, independent members of our Board and all committees of the Board generally meet in executive
session without management present during their regularly scheduled in-person board and committee meetings, and on an as-needed basis during telephonic and special
meetings. Robert W. Matschullat, our independent Chair, presides over executive sessions of the Board and the committee chairs, each of whom is independent, preside over executive sessions of the committees. Limitation on Other Board and Audit Committee Service Our Corporate Governance Guidelines establish the following limits on our directors serving on outside publicly-traded company boards and audit
committees: Director Category Limit on publicly-traded board and committee service, including Visa All directors 5 boards Directors who are CEOs of a publicly-traded company 3 boards Directors who serve on our Audit and Risk Committee 3 audit committees The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may grant exceptions to the limits on a case-by-case basis after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the request. The Guidelines provide that prior to accepting an invitation to serve on
the board or audit committee of another publicly-traded company, a director should advise the Chair of the Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the invitation so that the Board, through the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee, has the opportunity to review the director’s ability to continue to fulfill his or her responsibilities as a member of the Company’s Board or Audit and Risk Committee. When reviewing such a request, the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee may consider a number of factors, including the director’s other time commitments, record of attendance at board and committee meetings, potential conflicts of interest and other legal considerations, and the
impact of the proposed directorship or audit committee service on the director’s availability. Management
Development and Succession Planning Our Board believes that one of its primary responsibilities is to oversee the development and
retention of executive talent and to ensure that an appropriate succession plan is in place for our Chief Executive Officer and other members of management. Each quarter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets with our Executive
Vice President, Human Resources and other executives to discuss management succession and development planning and to address potential vacancies in senior leadership. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also annually reviews with the
Board succession planning for our Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors’ Role in Risk Oversight Our Board recognizes the importance of effective risk oversight in running a successful business and in fulfilling its fiduciary
responsibilities to Visa and its stockholders. While the Chief Executive Officer, Vice Chairman and Chief Risk Officer and other members of our senior leadership team are responsible for the day-to-day management of risk, our Board is responsible for promoting an appropriate culture of risk management within the Company and for setting the right “tone at the top,” overseeing our
aggregate risk profile and monitoring how the Company addresses specific risks, such as strategic and competitive risks, financial risks, brand and reputation risks, cybersecurity and technology risks, legal and compliance risks, regulatory risks
and operational risks. 9 Table of Contents Board of Directors • The Board exercises its oversight responsibility for risk both directly and through its three standing committees. • Throughout the year, the Board and each committee spend a portion of their time reviewing and discussing specific risk topics. • On an annual basis, the Vice Chairman and Chief Risk Officer and other members of senior management report on our top enterprise risks, and the steps management has taken or will take to mitigate
these risks. • Our EVP, Technology provides annual updates to the Board on technology and cybersecurity. • In addition, the General Counsel updates the Board regularly on material legal and regulatory matters. • Written reports also are provided to and discussed by the Board regularly regarding recent business, legal, regulatory, competitive and other developments impacting the Company. Audit and Risk
Committee Oversees risks related to our enterprise risk
framework and programs, including: • financial statements, financial reporting and internal controls, • tax strategy, • credit and liquidity, • legal and regulatory, • key operational risks, • technology, including information security and cybersecurity, • compliance and ethics program, including AML and sanctions and • business continuity plan. Compensation Committee Oversees risks related to employees and compensation, including: • our compensation policies and practices for all employees, and • our incentive and equity- based compensation plans. For additional information regarding the Compensation Committee’s review of compensation-related risk, please see the section entitled Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs. Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Oversees risks related to our overall corporate governance, including: • board effectiveness, • board and committee composition, •  board size and structure, • director independence, • board succession, • senior management succession, and • our corporate responsibility, philanthropy, and political participation and contributions. In addition, each of the Committees meet in executive session with management to discuss our risk profile and risk
exposures. For example, the Audit and Risk Committee meets regularly with our Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Vice Chairman and Chief Risk Officer, Chief Auditor, Chief Compliance Officer and other members of senior management to
discuss our major risk exposures and other programs. Stockholder Engagement on Corporate Governance, Corporate
Responsibility and Executive Compensation Matters Our Board and management team greatly value the opinions and feedback of our
stockholders, which is why we have proactive, ongoing engagement with our stockholders throughout the year focused on corporate governance, corporate responsibility and executive compensation, in addition to the ongoing dialogue among our
stockholders and our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations team on Visa’s financial and strategic performance. 10 Table of Contents We contacted our Top 50 Stockholders and other key stakeholders Representing over of our

statement disclosures to improve transparency in these areas. In addition, we held our 2017 Investor Day in June of this year, which provided an opportunity for our stockholders to hear directly from management on Visa’s long-term corporate
strategy and ask questions of the management team. Stockholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with us on these or other
matters may contact our Corporate Secretary electronically at corporatesecretary@visa.com or by mail at Visa Inc., P.O. Box 193243, San Francisco, CA 94119. Communicating with the Board of Directors Our Board has adopted a process by which stockholders or other interested persons may communicate with the Board or any of its members. Stockholders and
other interested parties may send communications in writing to any or all directors (including the Chair or the non-employee directors as a group) electronically to board@visa.com or by mail c/o our
Corporate Secretary, Visa Inc., P.O. Box 193243, San Francisco, CA 94119. Communications that meet the procedural and substantive requirements of the process approved by the Board will be delivered to the specified member of the Board, non-employee directors as a group or all members of the Board, as applicable, on a periodic basis, which generally will be in advance of or at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board. Communications of a more
urgent nature will be referred to the General Counsel, who will determine whether it should be delivered more promptly. Additional information regarding the procedural and substantive requirements for communicating with our Board may be found on our
website at http://investor.visa.com , under “Corporate Governance – Contact the Board.” All communications involving

Whistleblower Policy, a copy of which may be obtained by contacting our Corporate Secretary. Attendance at
Board, Committee and Annual Stockholder Meetings Our Board and its committees meet throughout the year on a set schedule, hold special
meetings as needed, and act by written consent from time to time. The Board met 10 times during fiscal year 2017. Each director attended at least 75% or more of the aggregate of: (i) the total number of meetings of the Board held during the
period in fiscal year 2017 for which he or she served as a director, and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which such director served as a member during the period in fiscal year 2017. The total number of
meetings held by each committee is listed below, under the heading Committees of the Board of Directors . It is our policy that all members of the Board should endeavor to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. All nine of our
then-directors attended the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Mr. Lundgren joined the Board in April 2017 and, therefore, did not attend the 2017 Annual Meeting. Codes of Conduct and Ethics Our Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all directors, officers, employees and contingent staff of the Company.
Additionally, the Board has adopted a supplemental Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, which applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, General Counsel and other senior financial officers, whom we refer to
collectively as senior officers. These Codes require the senior officers to engage in honest and ethical conduct in performing their duties, provide guidelines for the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
professional relationships, and provide mechanisms to report unethical conduct. Our senior officers are held accountable for their adherence to the Codes. If we amend or grant any waiver from a provision of our Codes, we will publicly disclose such
amendment or waiver in accordance with and if required by applicable law, including by posting such amendment or waiver on our website at http://investor.visa.com or by filing a current report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Political
Engagement and Disclosure Public sector decisions significantly affect our business and industry, as well as the communities in which we
operate. For this reason, we participate in the political process through regular and constructive engagement with government officials and policy-makers, by encouraging the civic involvement of our employees, and by contributing to candidates and
political organizations where permitted by applicable law. We are committed to conducting these activities in a transparent manner that reflects responsible corporate citizenship and best serves the interests of our shareholders, employees, and
other stakeholders. Additional information regarding our political activities and oversight may be found at https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/operating-responsibly.html . Visa has a Political Participation, Lobbying and Contributions Policy that prohibits our directors, officers and employees from using Company resources
to promote their personal political views, causes or candidates, and specifies that the Company will not directly or indirectly reimburse any personal political contributions or expenses. Directors, officers and employees also may not lobby
government officials on the Company’s behalf absent the pre-approval of the Company’s Government Relations department. As such, our lobbying and political spending seek to promote the interests of
the Company and its stockholders, and not the personal political preferences of our directors or executives. 12 Table of Contents Under the Policy, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must pre-approve the use of corporate funds for political contributions, including contributions made to trade associations to support targeted political campaigns and contributions to organizations registered under
Section 527 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to support political activities. The Policy further requires the Company to make reasonable efforts to obtain from U.S. trade associations whose annual membership dues exceed $25,000 the portion of
such dues that are used for political contributions. This information must then be included in the annual contributions report that is posted on our website. We endeavor to maintain a healthy and transparent relationship with governments around the world by communicating our views and concerns to elected
officials and policy-makers. As an industry leader, we encounter challenges and opportunities on a wide range of policy matters. These issues may include regulations and policies on interchange fees, cyber security, data security, privacy,
intellectual property, surcharging, payroll and prepaid cards, mobile payments, tax, international trade and market access, and financial inclusion, among others. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews our political contributions and lobbying expenditures, which includes information
regarding memberships in, or payments to, tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation. Additional information on our political contributions and lobbying expenditures can be found on our
website, including our annual contributions report and links to our quarterly U.S. federal lobbying activities and expenditures reports. In 2017,
the Center for Political Accountability assessed our disclosures for its annual CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, known as the CPA-Zicklin Index. The CPA-Zicklin Index measures the transparency, policies and practices of the S&P 500 with respect to political disclosures. Visa was designated
a “trendsetter” (the highest designation in the CPA-Zicklin Index) with a score of 94.3 out of 100. Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability The Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee of our Board oversees Visa’s corporate responsibility initiatives. We believe that as a trusted brand in payments, Visa has a tremendous opportunity and responsibility to use our business to connect the world – enabling
economic growth and strengthening economies while also helping improve lives and create a better world. We are committed to managing the risks and opportunities that arise from environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. 13 Table of Contents As detailed below, Visa takes an integrated approach to managing ESG performance and transparency,

Lundgren joined the Board and the Audit and Risk Committee in April 2017. 15 Table of Contents Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions The Audit and Risk Committee has adopted a written Statement of Policy with Respect to Related Person Transactions, governing any
transaction, arrangement or relationship between the Company and any related person where the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 and any related person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest.
Under the Policy, the Audit and Risk Committee reviews related person transactions and may approve or ratify them only if it is determined that they are in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. When
reviewing a related person transaction, the Audit and Risk Committee may take into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances available to it, including: (i) the material terms and conditions of the transaction or transactions;
(ii) the related person’s relationship to Visa; (iii) the related person’s interest in the transaction, including their position or relationship with, or ownership of, any entity that is a party to or has an interest in the
transaction; (iv) the approximate dollar value of the transaction; (v) the availability from other sources of comparable products or services; and (vi) an assessment of whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the
terms available to us from an unrelated third party. In the event we become aware of a related person transaction that was not previously approved
or ratified under the Policy, the Audit and Risk Committee will evaluate all options available, including ratification, revision or termination of the related person transaction. The Policy is intended to augment and work in conjunction with our
other policies that include code of conduct or conflict of interest provisions, including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers. We engage in transactions, arrangements and relationships with many other entities, including financial institutions and professional organizations, in
the ordinary course of our business. Some of our directors, executive officers, greater than five percent stockholders and their immediate family members, each a related person under the Policy, may be directors, officers, partners, employees or
stockholders of these entities. We carry out transactions with these entities on customary terms, and, in many instances, our directors and executive officers may not be aware of them. To our knowledge, since the beginning of fiscal year 2017, no
related person has had a material interest in any of our business transactions or relationships. 16 Table of Contents Report of the Audit and Risk Committee The Committee, comprised of independent directors, is responsible for monitoring and overseeing Visa’s financial
reporting process on behalf of the Board. The functions of the Committee are described in greater detail in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter, adopted by the Board, which may be found on the Company’s website at www.visa.com under
“Corporate Governance – Committee Composition.” Visa’s management has the primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal financial controls, for preparing the financial statements, and for the
public reporting process. KPMG LLP, Visa’s independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of the Company’s audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In this
context, the Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. In addition, the Committee has discussed with KPMG the matters required
to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The Committee also has received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by the applicable
requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and the Committee has discussed the independence of KPMG with that firm. The Committee also
has considered whether KPMG’s provision of non-audit services to the Company impairs the auditor’s independence, and concluded that KPMG is independent from the Committee and the Company’s
management. Based on the Committee’s review and discussions noted above, the Committee recommended to the
Board that the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, for filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors Mary B. Cranston (Chair) Lloyd A. Carney Gary A. Hoffman John F. Lundgren 17 Table of Contents Compensation Committee Committee

Fernández-Carbajal, Alfred F. Kelly, Jr., before his employment with Visa, David J. Pang, before leaving the Board during fiscal 2017, John A. C. Swainson, and Maynard G. Webb, Jr.) was or had ever been one of our officers or employees.
In addition, during the last fiscal year, none of our executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or the compensation committee of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board or Compensation
Committee. Effective as of October 17, 2016, Alfred F. Kelly, Jr., who became our Chief Executive Officer Designate as of October 31, 2016 and our Chief Executive Officer on December 1, 2016, ceased to serve on the Compensation
Committee when he was named as our Chief Executive Officer Designate. David J. Pang ceased to serve on the Compensation Committee effective as of January 31, 2017. Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs The Compensation Committee annually considers potential risks when reviewing and approving our compensation programs. We have designed our compensation
programs, including our incentive compensation plans, with specific features to address potential risks while rewarding employees for achieving long-term financial and strategic objectives through prudent business judgment and appropriate risk
taking. The following elements have been incorporated in our compensation programs for executive officers: • A Balanced Mix of Compensation Components – The target compensation mix for our executive officers
is composed of salary, annual cash incentives and long-term equity incentives, representing a mix that is not overly weighted toward short-term cash incentives. • Multiple Performance Factors – Our incentive compensation plans use Company-wide metrics and
individual performance goals, which encourage the achievement of objectives for the overall benefit of the Company. Annual cash incentive awards are dependent on multiple performance metrics including Net Income Growth and Net Revenue Growth, both
as adjusted for unusual or non-recurring items, as well as individual goals related to specific strategic or operational objectives. • Long-term Incentives – Our long-term incentives are equity-based and generally have a three-year
vesting schedule to complement our annual cash-based incentives. • Capped Incentive Awards – Annual incentive awards and performance share awards are capped at 200%
of target for executive officers. • Stock Ownership Guidelines – Our guidelines call for significant share ownership, which aligns the
interests of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our stockholders. • Clawback Policy – Our Clawback Policy authorizes the Board to recoup past incentive compensation
in the event of a material restatement of the Company’s financial results due to fraud, intentional misconduct or gross negligence of the executive officer. Additionally, the Compensation Committee annually considers an assessment of compensation-related risks for all of our employees. Based on this
assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Visa. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee reviewed the key
design elements of our compensation programs in relation to industry “best practices” as presented by Frederic W. Cook & Co. (FW Cook), the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant, as well as the means of
mitigating potential risks, such as through our internal controls and oversight by management and the Board. In addition, management completed an inventory of incentive programs below the executive level and reviewed the design of these incentives
both internally and with FW Cook to conclude that such programs do not encourage excessive risk taking. 19 Table of Contents Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has: • reviewed and discussed the section entitled Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management; and • based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis section be included in this proxy statement. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE Suzanne Nora Johnson (Chair) Francisco Javier Fernández-Carbajal John A. C. Swainson Maynard G. Webb, Jr. 20 Table of Contents Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Committee

2017: 7 “We continued our focus on board refreshment, including reviewing our director skills and
qualification criteria to make sure we have the right mix of directors in place to support Visa’s long-term strategy.” – John A. C. Swainson, Chair Key Activities in 2017 • Identified, selected and recommended a new director, John F. Lundgren, to serve as a member of the Board and the Audit and Risk Committee; • Reviewed the criteria used to identify individuals qualified to become our directors to better align with our current business needs and long-term strategy; • Regularly discussed board composition and reviewed director candidates in light of our director qualification criteria, current business needs and long-term strategy; • Reviewed the company’s governance practices and policies, including the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, Corporate Governance Guidelines and Board Communications Policy, which were approved by
the Board; • Reaffirmed the Board’s categorical director independence standards, and reviewed the qualifications and determined the independence of the members of the Board and its committees; • Recommended to the Board changes to the Board’s committee composition, which resulted in • Appointment of Maynard Webb to the Compensation Committee; • Appointment of John F. Lundgren to the Audit and Risk Committee and his designation as an “audit committee financial expert”; and • Appointment of Francisco Javier Fernandez-Carbajal to the Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee; • Reviewed each director’s compliance with the requirements of the Corporate Governance Guidelines relating to service on other boards or audit committees of publicly-traded companies; • Reviewed succession and development plans for management, including the succession of the Chief Executive Officer in the event of an emergency or retirement; • Oversaw the annual evaluation of the Board, its committees and directors; • Oversaw our stockholder engagement program; • Reviewed and approved the 2017 corporate political contribution plan, and oversaw the Company’s political contributions and lobbying activities; and • Reviewed corporate responsibility developments and oversaw Company’s charitable giving. Nomination Process and Stockholder Proposed Candidates The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers and recommends
candidates to the Board in accordance with its charter, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the criteria adopted by the Board regarding director candidate qualifications. Candidates may come to the
attention of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee from current directors, members of management, a professional search firm or a stockholder. Stockholders may propose a director candidate to be considered for nomination by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee by providing the
information specified in our Corporate Governance Guidelines to our Corporate Secretary within the timeframe specified for stockholder nominations of directors in our Bylaws. For additional information regarding the process for proposing director
candidates to the Nominating and Corporate 21 Table of Contents Governance Committee for consideration, please see our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Stockholders who wish to nominate a person for election as a director at an annual meeting of stockholders
must follow the procedure described under the heading Other Information – Stockholder Nomination of Director Candidates and Other Stockholder Proposals for 2018 Annual Meeting on page 86 of this
proxy statement. For additional information regarding this process, please see our Bylaws. Criteria for
Nomination to the Board of Directors and Diversity The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee applies the same standards in
considering director candidates submitted by stockholders as it does in evaluating other candidates, including incumbent directors. The identification and selection of qualified directors is a complex and subjective process that requires
consideration of many intangible factors, and will be significantly influenced by the particular needs of the Board from time to time. As a result, there is no specific set of minimum qualifications, qualities or skills that are necessary for a
nominee to possess, other than those that are necessary to meet U.S. legal, regulatory and NYSE listing requirements and the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Corporate Governance Guidelines and charters of the Board’s
committees. However, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board have identified the ten skills and qualifications listed below as important criteria for membership on the Visa Board. In addition to the above qualities, the Board, through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, strives to
have a board which reflects the diversity of our key constituencies around the world (clients, customers, employees, business partners and stockholders). While the Board does not have a formal policy on diversity, in assembling our Board, our
objective is to have wide diversity in terms of business experiences, functional skills, gender, race, ethnicity, and cultural backgrounds. 22 Table of Contents COMPENSATION OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS We compensate non-employee directors for their service on the Board with a combination of cash and equity awards, the amounts of which are commensurate with their role and involvement, and consistent with peer company practices. In setting director compensation, we consider
the significant amount of time our directors expend in fulfilling their duties as well as the skill level required of members of our Board. We intend to compensate our non-employee directors in a way that is
competitive, attracts and retains a high caliber of directors, and aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. Neither Mr. Scharf, who was our Chief Executive Officer until December 1, 2016, nor Mr. Kelly who was our Chief
Executive Officer for the remainder of fiscal year 2017, received additional compensation for their service as directors. However, Mr. Kelly received one quarterly installment in fiscal year 2017 prior to his becoming an employee for his
service as a non-employee director. All amounts received by Mr. Kelly, whether in his capacity as a director or an executive officer, are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table. The Compensation Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, has the primary responsibility for reviewing and considering any
revisions to our director compensation program. The Compensation Committee undertook its annual review of the type and form of compensation paid to our non-employee directors in connection with their service
on the Board and its committees for fiscal year 2017. The Compensation Committee considered the results of an independent analysis completed by FW Cook. As part of this analysis, FW Cook reviewed non-employee director compensation trends and data from companies comprising the same executive compensation peer group used by the Compensation Committee in connection with its review of executive compensation. Pursuant to this compensation review process, and
after considering FW Cook’s advice that the changes are consistent with our peer group, the Compensation Committee made the following changes to the non-employee director compensation for fiscal year
2017: the annual equity grant value was increased to $185,000; the additional cash retainer for our independent Chair was increased to $185,000; and the additional cash retainer for the Chair of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee was
increased to $20,000. In addition, effective for fiscal year 2018, the annual equity award vests immediately upon grant. There have been no other changes to our non-employee director compensation program for
fiscal year 2017. Highlights of our Non-Employee Directors Compensation
Program AMONG THE HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR PROGRAM ARE: No Fees for
Board Meeting Attendance: No fees are paid for board meeting attendance. Emphasis on Equity: There is an emphasis
on equity in the overall compensation mix to further align interests with stockholders. Recognition of Special Roles: Special
roles (such as independent Chair and Committee Chairs) are fairly recognized for their additional time commitments. Formulaic Annual Equity Grants with Immediate
Vesting: Annual restricted stock units are granted under a fixed-value formula with immediate vesting (starting in fiscal year 2018) to support independence. Robust Stock Ownership Guidelines: A
robust stock ownership guideline of five times the annual board membership retainer supports alignment with stockholders’ interests. Limited
Perquisites and Related Tax Gross-Ups: Other benefits are limited (e.g., matching charitable contributions). 23 Table of Contents Annual Retainers Paid in Cash Each non-employee director receives an annual cash retainer for his or her service on the Board, as well as
additional cash retainers if he or she serves as the independent Chair, on a committee or as the chair of a committee. The following table lists the cash retainer amounts in effect during fiscal year 2017. Type of Retainer Amount of Retainer Annual Board
Membership $105,000 Independent Chair $185,000 Audit and Risk Committee
Membership $20,000 Compensation Committee
Membership $10,000 Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee Membership $10,000 Audit and Risk Committee
Chair $25,000 (in addition to member retainer) Compensation Committee Chair $20,000 (in addition to member retainer) Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
Chair $20,000 (in addition to member retainer) U.S.-based directors may defer the payment of all or a portion of the cash retainer payments. All cash retainers are
paid in quarterly installments throughout the year unless a director elected to defer the payment. Directors are also reimbursed for customary expenses incurred while attending meetings of the Board and its committees. Equity Compensation Each non-employee director also receives an annual equity grant. In fiscal year 2017, a grant with a grant date
value of $185,000 was awarded to each non-employee director other than Gary Hoffman on November 19, 2016. In the November following the date of a director’s election or appointment to the Board, the
director receives a prorated initial grant based on the partial year of board service. Accordingly, Gary Hoffman received a grant with a grant date value of $123,333 on November 19, 2016. Grants to all non-employee directors were made in the form of restricted stock units, which vest on the first anniversary of the grant dates, but may be accelerated upon completion of service on the Board or in other
limited circumstances. Effective for fiscal year 2018, the annual equity award vests immediately upon grant. Directors may elect to defer settlement of all or a portion of their equity grants. Stock Ownership Guidelines The stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors specify that each director should own shares of
our common stock equal to five times the annual board membership retainer. Equity interests that count toward the satisfaction of the ownership guidelines include shares owned outright by the director, shares jointly owned and restricted stock units
payable in shares. Directors have five years from the date they become a member of the Board to attain these ownership levels. Each non-employee director with at least five years of service on our Board
currently meets or exceeds the ownership guidelines. We also have an insider trading policy which, among other things, prohibits directors from hedging the economic risk of their stock ownership or pledging their shares. 24 Table of Contents Charitable Matching Gift Program Our non-employee directors may participate in our Board Charitable Matching Gift Program. Under this program,
Visa will match contributions to eligible non-profit organizations, up to a maximum of $15,000 per director per calendar year. Our non-employee directors may also
participate in our PAC Charitable Matching Program. Under this program, when non-employee directors make a contribution to a Visa PAC, Visa will match their contribution to a qualifying charity or charities
the non-employee director selects, up to a maximum of $5,000 per director per calendar year. Director Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2017 The following tables provide information on the total compensation earned by each

consolidated financial statements, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 17, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, each non-employee director had 2,289 unvested restricted stock units outstanding, except for Gary A. Hoffman who had 1,526 unvested restricted stock units outstanding, John F. Lundgren who did not have any unvested
restricted stock units and Alfred F. Kelly Jr., whose stock holdings are detailed in the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2017 Fiscal Year-End Table . (3) Amounts include the matching contributions we made on behalf of our directors for fiscal year 2017 pursuant to our Board

Mr. Webb. Because fiscal year 2017 overlaps two calendar years, amounts matched on behalf of Mr. Matschullat during the fiscal year is greater than $15,000 even though his donations were within the $15,000 per calendar year limit. The
amounts also include the $5,000 matching contributions we made on behalf of each of the following directors for fiscal year 2017 pursuant to our PAC Charitable Matching Program: Mr. Carney; Ms. Cranston; Mr. Matschullat; Ms. Nora
Johnson; Mr. Swainson; and Mr. Webb. 25 Table of Contents (4) Mr. Hoffman received a prorated stock award based on the portion of the Board year he served as a Director. (5) Mr. Hoffman’s All Other Compensation reflects $233,613 in compensation during fiscal year 2017 in consideration

Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Highlights Visa delivered another year of strong financial results in fiscal year 2017. The following table summarizes our key financial results for fiscal years
2017 and 2016. Please see the section entitled Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion
of our fiscal year 2017 financial results. In addition, Visa’s total shareholder return for fiscal year 2017 reflected a 28.2% increase in shareholder value. Fiscal Year 2017 Fiscal Year 2016 Change (%) (2) Net Revenue Growth, as

accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), adjusted to exclude the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. For supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation to U.S. GAAP see Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 filed with the SEC on November 17, 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. When making its determination of the net revenue, net income, and earnings per share metrics, which were used
as goals for the annual incentive plan and for performance share awards, the Compensation Committee further adjusted as reported results for the items described under the heading Compensation Discussion and
Analysis – Corporate Performance Measures and Results for Fiscal Year 2017 and Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Long-Term Incentive Awards Granted in Fiscal
Year 2017. (2) Calculated based on unrounded numbers. 37 Table of Contents How Fiscal Year 2017 Named Executive Officer Compensation Is Tied to Company Performance Our corporate performance was a key factor in our fiscal year 2017 named executive officer compensation program: Link to Company Performance • For fiscal year 2017, 92% of our Chief Executive Officer’s target compensation was performance-based and 89% of the
average of our other named executive officers’ target compensation was performance-based. Utilize
Annual and Long-Term Awards • Each named executive officer’s performance-based compensation includes an annual cash incentive award and long-term
performance shares. For the annual cash incentive, the target award is established at the beginning of the fiscal year and the actual award is adjusted based on performance against pre-established goals.
Performance shares provide the opportunity for shares to be earned at the end of a three-year performance period if pre-established financial goals are met. We also grant time-based stock options and
restricted stock units, which provide value based on the Company’s stock price performance. Focus on
Corporate Performance Metrics • For fiscal year 2017, Net Income Growth and Net Revenue Growth were the key metrics for our annual cash incentive
awards. These metrics were adjusted (in accordance with terms approved at the beginning of fiscal year 2017) when determining the annual cash incentive awards as described under the heading Compensation Discussion and
Analysis – Corporate Performance Measures and Results for Fiscal Year 2017 . In this proxy statement, we refer to these metrics as Net Income Growth – VIP adjusted and Net Revenue
Growth – VIP adjusted. Actual performance for each metric significantly exceeded target for fiscal year 2017. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee approved the corporate performance portion of the annual incentive award paying out
at 185% of target. • Earnings Per Share (EPS) and relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR), were established as performance metrics for our
performance share awards. The final number of shares earned pursuant to a performance share award is determined based on the average EPS result over the three separate years applicable to the particular performance share award and the relative TSR
for the three-year period. As described under the heading Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Long-Term Incentive Awards Granted in Fiscal Year 2017 , and in accordance with terms approved at the
beginning of fiscal year 2017, the Compensation Committee adjusted the fiscal year 2017 EPS when determining applicable performance share results. In this proxy statement, we refer to this metric as EPS – PS adjusted. Our fiscal year
2017 EPS – PS adjusted, was above target, resulting in a performance factor of 176.4% for the relevant portion of the award. • The performance shares previously awarded on November 19, 2014 completed their three-year performance period
following the 2017 fiscal year-end. Performance shares earned pursuant to this award were based on EPS – PS adjusted, for fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017 and three-year relative TSR (measured
against the S&P 500). As described under the heading Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Determination of Shares Earned for Performance Shares Previously Awarded on November 19,
2014 both metrics were above target and the performance shares earned equated to 175.8% of the target share award. 38 Table of Contents Principles of our Compensation Program The following underlying principles are reflected in our executive compensation program: Principles of our Compensation Programs Pay for Performance The key principle of our compensation philosophy is pay for performance. Alignment with Stockholders’ Interests We reward performance that meets or exceeds the performance goals that the
Compensation Committee establishes with the objective of increasing stockholder value. Variation Based on Performance We favor variable pay
opportunities that are based on performance over fixed pay. The total compensation received by our named executive officers varies based on corporate and individual performance measured against annual and long-term goals. 39 Table of Contents Key Elements of our Compensation Programs CEO Other NEOs

portion of each named executive officer’s target annual compensation is tied to corporate and individual performance. Annual Say-on-Pay Vote: We conduct an annual Say-on-Pay advisory vote. At our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, more than
96% of the votes cast on the Say-on-Pay proposal were in favor of the fiscal year 2016 compensation of our named executive officers. Similarly, at our 2016 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders, more than 97% of the votes cast on the Say-on-Pay proposal were in favor of the fiscal year 2015 compensation of our named executive
officers. Clawback Policy: Our Clawback Policy
allows the Board to recoup any excess incentive compensation paid to our executive officers if the financial results on which the awards were based are materially restated due to fraud, intentional misconduct or gross negligence of the executive
officer. Short-Term and Long-Term
Incentives/Measures: Our annual and long-term plans provide a balance of incentives and include different measures of performance. Independent Compensation Consultant: The
Compensation Committee engages an independent compensation consultant, who provides no other service to the Company. Stock Ownership Guidelines: To further
align the interests of management with our stockholders, we have significant stock ownership guidelines that require our executive officers to hold a multiple of their annual base salary in equity. Limited Perquisites and Related Tax Gross-Ups: We provide limited perquisites and no tax gross-ups except on business-related relocation expenses and tax equalization for employees on expatriate
assignments, as provided in our relocation and tax equalization policies or in the offer letters for our President and Chief Financial Officer. Double-Trigger Severance Arrangements: Our Executive Severance Plan and equity award agreements generally require a qualifying termination of employment in addition to a change of control before any change of control payments or benefits are triggered. Mitigate
Inappropriate Risk Taking: In addition to our clawback policy, stock ownership guidelines and prohibition of hedging and pledging, we structure our compensation programs so that they minimize inappropriate risk taking by our executive
officers and other employees, including using multiple performance metrics and multi-year performance periods and capping our annual incentive plan and performance share awards. WHAT WE DON’T DO Gross-ups for Excise Taxes: Our Executive Severance Plan does not contain a gross-up for excise taxes that may be imposed as a result of severance or other payments deemed made in connection with a change of
control. Reprice Stock Options: Our equity
incentive plan prohibits the repricing of stock options and stock appreciation rights without prior stockholder approval. Fixed Term Employment Agreements: Employment of our executive officers is “at will” and may be terminated by either the Company or the employee at any time. Hedging
and Pledging: Our insider trading policy prohibits all employees and directors from hedging their economic interest in the Visa shares they hold or pledging Visa shares as collateral for a loan. 41 Table of Contents How our Incentive Program is Tied to our Long-Term Company Strategy We have designed our strategic pillars, which are outlined below, to position the Company competitively and thereby deliver superior performance, which
will in turn create value for our stockholders. As illustrated below, we tie our executive compensation program to our long-term business strategy by keeping our
executive officers focused on, and rewarding them for, their achievement of goals and fulfillment of activities that support our strategic pillars. In addition, achieving our strategic pillars helps drive the long-term corporate performance metrics
used in our executive compensation program. Annual Incentive
Plan: Individual and Corporate Performance ● A significant portion
of our executive officers’ individual performance goals are tied to one or more of our strategic pillars (as explained further in this proxy statement under Individual Performance Goals and Results for Fiscal Year 2017 ) ● We link a substantial portion of compensation to corporate performance through use of annual cash incentives determined by Net Income Growth and Net Revenue
Growth Aligns executive officers’ interests with
stockholders’ interests by: ● rewarding individual performance for achievement of strategic goals (designed to position the Company competitively) ● promoting strong annual net income and revenue growth Long-Term Equity Grants: Individual
and Corporate Performance ● We consider individual performance (which is tied to the strategic pillars), in setting the value of our executive officers’ long-term equity grant ● We link a substantial portion of compensation to long-term corporate performance through the use of long-term incentives, including performance shares that use EPS and
relative TSR as financial metrics Further aligns executive officers’ interests with long-term stockholders’
interests by: ● taking individual performance (which is tied to strategic pillars) into account in making grants ● linking a substantial portion of long-term compensation to long-term corporate performance
and operational efficiency Compensation Component Link to Strategy
Strategy & Performance Alignment 42 Table of Contents Say-on-Pay At the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, more than 96% of the votes cast on the Company’s annual Say-on-Pay proposal supported our named executive officer compensation program. We believe these results represent strong investor support of our overall compensation philosophy and decisions for fiscal year
2016. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee did not make any material changes to the underlying structure of our executive compensation program for fiscal year 2017. Nevertheless, the Compensation Committee regularly reviews and adjusts the
program to ensure it remains competitive and aligned with our stockholders’ interests. Setting Executive
Compensation Compensation Committee and Management Our Compensation Committee, which consists solely of independent directors, is responsible for establishing and reviewing the overall compensation
philosophy and program for our named executive officers. As discussed in detail under the heading Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs, when establishing the annual compensation program for our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee takes into consideration the potential risks associated with the program and structures it to provide appropriate incentives without
encouraging excessive risk taking. Before End of Fiscal Year Beginning of
Fiscal Year During Fiscal Year After End of Fiscal Year 43 Table of Contents Setting Performance Goals and Making Compensation Determinations ● Compensation Committee begins review of our compensation program, including determining if our compensation levels are competitive with our peer companies and if
any changes should be made to the program for the next fiscal year. ● Compensation Committee determines the principal components of compensation for the named executive officers and the individual performance goals of the Chief
Executive Officer and sets the performance goals for each corporate performance-based compensation component. ● Chief Executive Officer sets individual performance goals for each of the other named executive officers, which are reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The
individual performance goals are designed to drive our corporate goals and strategic pillars. ● Compensation Committee meets regularly throughout the year, with management and in executive session, and reviews the Company’s performance to date against the
corporate performance goals. ● Compensation Committee conducts a multi-part review of each named executive officer and the Company’s performance for the preceding fiscal year measured
against the pre-established performance goals and makes annual compensation determinations. The Compensation Committee’s objective is to ensure that the level of compensation approved is consistent with the level of corporate and individual
performance delivered. ● As part of the annual compensation review process, our Chief Executive Officer
reviews the performance of each named executive officer (other than his own performance, which is reviewed by the Compensation Committee) relative to the individual annual performance goals established for the fiscal year. Our Chief Executive
Officer then presents his compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on his review. ● Compensation Committee exercises discretion in modifying any compensation recommendations relating to named executive officers that were made by our Chief Executive
Officer and approves all compensation decisions for our named executive officers. ● For his own performance review, the Chief Executive Officer prepares a self-assessment, which is presented to and discussed by the Compensation Committee and the
independent directors. When making compensation decisions for our Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers the views of the independent directors. Role of Independent Consultant Our Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain and replace compensation consultants to provide it with independent advice. The Compensation
Committee has engaged FW Cook as its independent consultant to advise it on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. This selection was made without the input or influence of management. Under
the terms of its agreement with the Compensation Committee, FW Cook will not provide any other services to the Company, unless directed to do so by the Compensation Committee. During fiscal year 2017 FW Cook provided no services to the Company other
than to advise the Compensation Committee on executive and non-employee director compensation issues. In addition, at the start of fiscal year 2017, the Compensation Committee conducted a formal evaluation of
the independence of FW Cook and, based on this review, did not identify any conflict of interest raised by the work FW Cook performed in fiscal year 2017. When conducting this evaluation, the Compensation Committee took into consideration the
factors set forth in Exchange Act Rule 10C-1 and the NYSE’s listing standards. 44 Table of Contents Compensation Philosophy and Objectives Our Philosophy We maintain compensation plans that tie a
substantial portion of our named executive officers’ overall target annual compensation to the achievement of our corporate performance goals. The Compensation Committee employs multiple performance measures and strives to award an appropriate
mix of annual and long-term equity incentives to avoid overweighting short-term objectives. Peer Group As part of its annual compensation review process, the Compensation Committee discussed with FW Cook an analysis of our fiscal year 2017 executive
compensation program, including total compensation and the elements used to compensate our named executive officers. It then compared the compensation of our named executive officers to the compensation of similarly situated named executive officers
of other companies. In particular, the Compensation Committee reviewed compensation levels of our compensation peer group as a reference point of competitive compensation levels. The review was based on public compensation data for our compensation
peer group and data from third-party compensation surveys. To best inform their pay decisions based on where the Company competes for talent, the
Compensation Committee established three categories for identifying peer companies: • Direct business competitors plus any companies listed as peers by a majority of these companies that would be considered
“peers of peers.” • Related-industry competitors who are S&P 500 companies (a) classified as financial services or technology,
excluding hardware and manufacturing, (b) with a 12-month average market-cap value between 1/4 th and 4x
Visa’s average market-cap, and (c) with revenues of less than $100 billion. • Strategic competitors who are S&P 500 companies recommended by management and approved by the Compensation Committee
that have respected global brands, fit the above size criteria, and are frequent competitors for executive talent. A list of 22
companies identified as peers for fiscal year 2017 is shown below. These remain unchanged from our fiscal year 2016 peer group: Direct Peers Related Industry Peers Financial Services Technology – American Express
Company – Discover Financial Services – MasterCard Incorporated – PayPal Holdings, Inc. – Bank of America Corporation – BlackRock, Inc. – Capital One Financial Corporation – Citigroup Inc. – JPMorgan Chase & Co. – Morgan Stanley – The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation – The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. – The PNC Financial Services Group,
Inc. – U.S. Bancorp – Wells Fargo & Company – Accenture plc – Facebook, Inc. – Alphabet Inc. – IBM Corporation – Microsoft Corporation – Oracle Corporation – salesforce.com, inc. Use of Market Data In order
to attract and retain key executives, we target total compensation for our named executive officers by reference to the range of compensation paid to similarly situated executive officers of our compensation peer group. This includes salary, annual
incentive targets and long-term incentive targets. The actual level of our named executive officers’ total direct compensation is determined based on both individual and corporate performance and can vary based on such factors as expertise,
performance or advancement potential. 45 Table of Contents Internal Equity and Tally Sheets As part of its annual compensation review, the Compensation Committee compares our named executive officers’ target annual compensation levels to
ensure they are internally equitable. The Compensation Committee also regularly reviews tally sheets for each named executive officer to ensure that it is considering a complete assessment of all compensation and benefits. The tally sheets include
each named executive officer’s wealth accumulation, which is comprised of the aggregate amount of equity awards and other compensation values accumulated by each named executive officer, and potential payments upon termination or termination
following a change of control. Components of Executive Compensation Compensation Component Type of Pay Key Characteristics Purpose Annual Cash Compensation Base Salary Fixed Annual adjustments based on individual performance, relative to market pay level, and internal pay equity. Attracts, retains and rewards NEOs by providing a fixed source of income to reward experience, skills, and competencies relative to market value of the job. Annual incentive Awards Cash Incentive Awards Performance- Based Variable cash compensation component Based on performance against pre- established individual and corporate performance goals. Focuses NEOs on our results by rewarding corporate and individual performance and achievement of strategic goals. Aligns NEO’s interests with stockholders by promoting strong annual income and revenue growth results. Long-term Incentive Awards Equity Granted in the Form of Stock Options, Restricted Stack Awards/Units and Performance Shares Performance- Based Long-term equity awards (excluding performance shares) vest in increments over a three-year period. Performance shares have a three-year performance period and vest at the end of the three-year period. Aligns each NEO’s interests with long- term stockholder interests by linking a substantial portion of each NEO’s
compensation to long-term corporate performance and operational efficiency. Retains NEOs through multi-year vesting of equity grants and
performance periods, as applicable Provides opportunities for wealth creation and stock ownership, which attract and motivate our NEOs and promotes retention. 46 Table of Contents Summary of Fiscal Year 2017 Base Salary and Incentive Compensation In November 2017, the Compensation Committee determined our named executive officers’ total direct compensation based on corporate
and individual performance for fiscal year 2017, which is comprised of the following elements: The table below reflects the above components for each named executive officer for fiscal year 2017. As the long-term
incentive awards for fiscal year 2017 set forth in the following table were awarded after the end of the fiscal year, they are discussed under the heading Fiscal Year 2018 Compensation – Long-Term

heading Fiscal Year 2018 Compensation – Long-Term Incentive Compensation for additional information regarding these awards. Fiscal Year 2017 Compensation Base Salary When setting our named executive officers’
base pay, the Compensation Committee generally targets the range of compensation paid to similarly situated executive officers of our compensation peer group. The Compensation Committee may set salaries above or below the median amount based on
considerations including the expertise, performance or advancement potential of each named executive officer. The base salary levels of our named executive officers typically are considered annually as part of our performance review process, and
upon a named executive officer’s promotion or other change in job responsibilities. During its annual review of the base salaries of our named
executive officers for fiscal year 2017, the Compensation Committee considered: • market data of our compensation peer group; • an internal review of each named executive officer’s compensation, both individually and relative to other named
executive officers; and • the individual performance of each named executive officer. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee made no changes to base salaries for fiscal year 2017. 48 Table of Contents Annual Incentive Plan These reflect weightings for our named executive officers, except our CEO. For our CEO, the weightings are: 80% for
Corporate Performance and 20% for Individual Performance. Incentive Plan Target Percentage. During fiscal year 2017, each of our named executive officers was eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award under the Visa Inc. Incentive Plan, or VIP, which we sometimes refer to as our annual
incentive plan. Each named executive officer’s potential award was expressed as a percentage of his or her base salary, including threshold, target and maximum percentages. After the end of the fiscal year, the Compensation Committee determined
the amount of each named executive officer’s actual annual incentive award based upon the achievement of a combination of pre-determined corporate and individual goals. Corporate Goals and Individual Goals. • In December 2016, the Compensation Committee established corporate threshold goals under the VIP for fiscal year 2017
based on Net Income and Net Revenue Growth, each as adjusted by the Compensation Committee. The threshold corporate performance goals for fiscal year 2017, which had to be met or exceeded before any annual incentive awards would be made, were Net
Income – VIP adjusted, of $4,044 million or Net Revenue Growth – VIP adjusted, of 8.0%. • No annual incentive payment may be made for fiscal year 2017 under the VIP unless one or both of these goals are
achieved. • The Compensation Committee established these threshold goals to allow the annual incentive award to be considered
performance-based and tax deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. They are separate from the payment goals the Compensation Committee uses to determine actual payouts for corporate performance described in the table below. • This approach further aligns our annual incentive plan program with stockholders’ interests by ensuring that no
incentive payment is made unless a certain level of corporate performance is achieved. Once either of the threshold corporate performance goals is met or exceeded, each named executive officer becomes eligible to receive up to his or her maximum
potential annual incentive award. When making final payout determinations, the Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion to award less than the maximum potential award. • As the threshold corporate performance levels for both metrics were achieved, fiscal year 2017 annual incentive payments
were then based on a combination of corporate and individual performance as described below. • For fiscal year 2017, 70% of the annual incentive award for our named executive officers is based on the achievement of
corporate performance goals (80% for our Chief Executive Officer), and 30% on the achievement of individual goals (20% for our Chief Executive Officer). These weightings balance the named executive officers’ shared responsibility to achieve
corporate goals that increase the value of the Company with the desire to motivate the named executive officers to achieve goals within each individual’s specific area of responsibility. These weightings also allow the Compensation Committee to
further differentiate compensation between the named executive officers based on their individual performance. Annual Base Salary x Annual Incentive
Target [% of Salary] x [Corporate Performance [ 70% ] + Individual Performance [ 30% ]] = Annual Incentive Award 49 Table of Contents Corporate Performance Measures and Results for Fiscal Year 2017 The Compensation Committee approved the corporate performance weightings, targets and metrics for fiscal year 2017 displayed in the table below. The
Compensation Committee selected the Net Income Growth and Net Revenue Growth performance measures based on their belief that they are important indicators of increased stockholder value. The Compensation Committee also approved a range of payouts as
a percentage of each named executive officer’s target annual bonus at various levels of performance. Displayed below are the specific
performance goals for each level of achievement, the payout ranges as a percentage of target for each level of achievement, and the actual FY17 result and approved payout as a percentage of target: Metric Weight Baseline Target Exceeding Target Significantly Exceeding Target Result Payout Net Income Growth – VIP adjusted 70% 7% 13%-16% 16.1%-19% 19.1%+ 23.3% 190% Net Revenue Growth – VIP
adjusted 30% 8% 16.5%-18.5% 18.6%-20.5% 20.6%+ 21.6% 174% Payout as a % of
Target 50%-90% 90%-130% 130%-170% 170%-200% 185% For purposes of the annual incentive plan payout percentage in fiscal year 2017, our Net Income
Growth – VIP adjusted, was determined by excluding the aforementioned adjustments from our U.S. GAAP Net Income described in footnote 1 to the table under the heading Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Highlights from our reported U.S.
GAAP Net Income, as well as other adjustments including VIP payment expenses for fiscal year 2016 and 2017, and net income related to acquisitions closed during fiscal 2017. Based on these pre-established adjustments for purposes of the annual incentive plan payout percentage in fiscal year 2017, our Net Income Growth – VIP adjusted was 23.3%, which is within the Significantly Exceeding Target range and allows for a payout range of 170%-200% of target. The Compensation Committee approved a payout of 190% for this metric. In making this determination, the Committee took into account that actual performance of 23.3% was well above the goal
established for the “Significantly Exceeding Target” range. Our actual Net Revenue Growth – VIP adjusted, for fiscal year
2017 was determined as year-over-year growth in gross operating revenues net of incentives, adjusted from our U.S. GAAP Net Revenue Growth by excluding net revenue related to acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2017. The result, as shown above,
was 21.6% Net Revenue Growth – VIP adjusted for fiscal year 2017, which is within the Significantly Exceeding Target range and allows for a payout of 170% – 200% of target. The Compensation Committee approved a payout
of 174% for this metric. In making this determination, the Committee took into account that actual performance of 21.6% was above the goals established for the “Significantly Exceeding Target” range. All of the Compensation Committee’s adjustments were made in accordance with the terms of the annual incentive plan determined at the beginning of
fiscal year 2017, as described earlier under Setting Performance Goals and Making Compensation Determinations . Based on the weightings
outlined in the above table, the payout result for corporate performance as a percentage of target is 185%. Individual Performance Goals and Results for
Fiscal Year 2017 The fiscal year 2017 individual goals for each of our named executive officers were set in December 2016. The Compensation
Committee believes that our named executive officers’ performance goals should support and help achieve the Company’s strategic objectives and be tied to their areas of responsibility. Individual performance goals for the Chief Executive
Officer were established with the oversight of the Compensation Committee. Individual performance goals for the other named executive officers were proposed by the Chief Executive Officer and reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. 50 Table of Contents As described under How our Incentive Program is Tied to our Long-Term Company Strategy earlier
in this proxy statement, these goals were established by reference to our corporate strategic “pillars” which are designed to position the Company competitively and thereby deliver superior performance, which would in turn create value for
our stockholders. To ensure that our executive officers stay focused on these pillars, a significant portion of their individual performance goals were tied to one or more of the pillars. Of note, our focus on Developing Best Talent includes goals
for our executives to attract and retain top talent, including creating a unique and compelling environment for our employees, a commitment to sponsorship of diverse employees, promotion of diversity and inclusion, gender and underrepresented
diversity, recruitment of underrepresented talent, and opportunities for women for leadership roles. After the end of the fiscal year, the
Compensation Committee, based on each named executive officer’s self-assessment and Mr. Kelly’s input, reviewed each named executive officer’s progress against his or her individual performance goals. Based on this assessment, a
named executive officer could receive an award from 0% to 200% of the individual portion of his or her annual incentive award. When making its award determinations, the Compensation Committee did not assign a specific weighting to any of the
individual goals, but instead reviewed each named executive officer’s progress against his or her individual goals in the aggregate. The following is a summary description of the performance goal results for each of the named executive officers
for fiscal year 2017. Mr. Kelly Goal Results FY2017 Performance Results •    Performed strongly against financial measures •    Deepened relationships with clients through key renewals and conversions •    Championed employee engagement, leadership, and diversity and inclusion

complex strategic opportunities •    Demonstrated leadership in continuing to implement strong corporate governance
practices •    Successfully led strategy for ongoing management of key litigation related
matters •    Successfully led legal and regulatory integration with Visa Europe Based on each named executive officer’s performance in managing their function and the progress they made towards
their individual goals as discussed above, the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, determined that each named executive officer made substantial progress and awarded the individual portion of each officer’s annual incentive at the
percentage of target displayed in the table below. Name Percentage of Target for individual portion Alfred F. Kelly,

Year 2017 Table. 52 Table of Contents Long-Term Incentive Compensation The Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, which we refer to as the equity incentive plan, is intended to promote our long-term success and
increase stockholder value by attracting, motivating and retaining our non-employee directors, officers, and employees. Additionally, to better tie our executive officers’ long-term interests with those
of our stockholders, the equity incentive plan does not allow the repricing of stock grants once they are awarded, without prior stockholder approval. The Compensation Committee administers the equity incentive plan with respect to our named executive officers and determines, in its discretion and in
accordance with the terms of the equity incentive plan, the recipients who may be granted awards, the form and amount of awards, the terms and conditions of awards (including vesting and forfeiture conditions), the timing of awards, and the form and
content of award agreements. Long-Term Incentive Awards Granted in Fiscal Year 2017 In determining the types and amounts of equity awards to be granted to our named executive officers in fiscal year 2017, the Compensation Committee
considered factors including the practices of companies in our compensation peer group, the actual compensation levels of similarly situated executive officers of companies in our compensation peer group, corporate and individual performance during
fiscal year 2016, recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer at the time (for awards to the named executive officers other than himself) and each named executive officer’s total compensation. The Compensation Committee also considered the
incentives provided by different award types, including increasing stockholder value, avoiding excessive risk taking, and encouraging employee retention. Below is an illustration of our equity grants awarded in fiscal year 2017 by type for our named
executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer: Fiscal Year 2017 Long-Term Incentive Awards Type 53 Table of Contents The following table displays the total combined value of equity awards approved by the Compensation

Fiscal Year 2017 and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2017 Table later in this proxy statement are computed in accordance with stock-based accounting rules and will be displayed in multiple years, the values in those tables
differ from the value displayed in the table above. Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units The dollar value of the equity awards in the table above were converted to a specific number of options or restricted stock units on the
November 19, 2016 grant date, based on the fair market value of our Class A common stock on that date and the Black-Scholes value of stock options. The value displayed for performance shares reflects the target value of the award. The
stock options and restricted stock units vest in three substantially equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment through each such vesting date. Performance Shares Designed to vary rewards based on
corporate performance results Generates value only if stock price appreciates Used to retain key executive officers Performance shares 50% Stock Options 25% Restricted Stock Units 25% 54 Table of Contents The target number of performance shares is determined at the beginning of a three-year performance
period and the number of shares earned at the end of the three-year period will range from zero to 200% of the target number of shares depending on our corporate performance, as measured by: • the annual EPS goal established for each fiscal year; and • an overall modifier based on Visa’s TSR ranked relative to S&P 500 companies, or TSR Rank, over the three-year
performance period. The TSR Rank modifier will reduce compensation to our named executive officers for periods when our
stockholders’ value increase is below the median of the companies comprising the S&P 500 and will enhance our named executive officers’ compensation for periods when our stockholders’ value increase exceeds the median of the
companies comprising the S&P 500. The total number of shares that may be earned at the end of the three-year period is capped at 200% of the target number of shares. One-third of the target performance shares awarded on November 19, 2016 were tied to the fiscal year 2017
EPS goal that the Compensation Committee established within the first ninety days of fiscal year 2017. The remaining two-thirds of the target shares awarded are tied to the EPS goals for each of fiscal years
2018 and 2019, which will be set by the Compensation Committee within the first ninety days of the respective fiscal year. The actual EPS result will be used to determine the percentage of target shares credited from each of the three award
segments. At the end of fiscal year 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed our EPS – PS adjusted, of $3.49 which was determined by excluding from U.S. GAAP EPS: the aforementioned adjustments from U.S. GAAP Net Income described in
footnote 1 to the table under the heading Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Highlights , as well as other adjustments including net income related to acquisitions closed during fiscal 2017. All of the Compensation Committee’s adjustments were
made in accordance with terms determined at the beginning of fiscal year 2017, as described earlier under Setting Performance Goals and Making Compensation Determinations . The Compensation Committee determined that the final EPS
result – PS adjusted, of $3.49 exceeded the target goal of $3.31 for fiscal year 2017. Using the unrounded result to interpolate between target (100%) and maximum (200%) yielded a result of 176.4% for fiscal year 2017. At the completion of the entire three-year performance period in November 2019, the shares credited from the above EPS calculations for the three fiscal
years will be totaled and the overall number of shares will be modified based on Visa’s TSR Rank for the full three-year period. This TSR Rank modification may increase or decrease the final number of shares earned by a maximum of 25% (see
chart below); however, the final number of shares earned at the end of the three-year period, after the modification is applied, is capped at 200% of the initial target number.

portion of the performance shares previously awarded to our named executive officers on November 19, 2014 and the second portion of the performance shares previously awarded to our named executive officers on November 19, 2015 (see
illustration below). Consistent with Financial Standards Accounting Board ASC Topic 718, the value of the performance share awards for
fiscal year 2017 included in the “Stock Awards” column of the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2017 later in this proxy statement represents the third segment of the award made on November 19, 2014, the second segment
of the award made on November 19, 2015 and the first segment of the award made on November 19, 2016. Determination of Shares Earned for Performance
Shares Previously Awarded on November 19, 2014 The performance shares previously awarded to certain of the named executive officers on
November 19, 2014 completed their three-year performance period following fiscal year 2017. As a result, the final number of shares earned pursuant to those awards based on the Company’s actual results over the three-year period was
determined and certified by the Compensation Committee in November 2017. As illustrated below, based on the annual EPS results for fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, and our TSR Rank over the three-year period, the performance shares earned equated
to 175.8% of the target award established on November 19, 2014.

Ms. Mahon Tullier earned shares equal to 175.8% of the target number of shares granted to each of them on November 19, 2014. As a result, Mr. McInerney earned 52,248 shares versus his target of 29,720 shares, Mr. Taneja earned
49,083 shares versus his target of 27,920 shares and Ms. Mahon Tullier earned 15,056 shares of her target of 8,564 shares. Messrs. Kelly and Prabhu did not receive performance share awards on November 19, 2014. Other Equity Awards in Fiscal Year 2017 The Compensation
Committee may award equity during the fiscal year to attract new executive officers and incent them to join Visa. During fiscal year 2017, the Committee made an equity grant to Mr. Kelly for this purpose in accordance with the terms of his
offer letter, which was the result of negotiations between Mr. Kelly and the Company. The terms of his offer letter are described in the section entitled Employment Arrangements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of
Control – Offer Letters with Alfred F. Kelly Jr. and Vasant M. Prabhu . During the negotiations, the Compensation Committee consulted with FW Cook, its independent compensation consultant,
and legal counsel with expertise in executive compensation matters. The Compensation Committee also reviewed relevant market data and the terms of Mr. Kelly’s compensation arrangements with his previous employer, including the value of
benefits Mr. Kelly would forfeit with his prior employer by agreeing to become our Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee and the independent members of the Board determined, in their judgment and based on Mr. Kelly’s
experience, qualifications, and skills, as well as prevailing market practices, that the compensation levels, awards and other terms contained in the offer letter were appropriate to attract and retain Mr. Kelly to serve as our Chief Executive
Officer. On November 19, 2016, as required under the terms of his offer letter, Mr. Kelly received “make-whole” equity
awards structured to replicate compensation that he forfeited by leaving his former employer to join Visa. Mr. Kelly received an award with a grant date value of $6,300,000, which converted into 77,951 restricted stock units. Also as required
under the terms of his offer letter, because his prior employer failed to exercise certain call rights in respect of Mr. Kelly’s equity investment in such employer within 90 days of his termination of employment with his prior employer, on
February 8, 2017, he received a make-whole equity award of $1,000,000, which converted into 11,752 restricted stock units. The restricted stock units will vest in three substantially equal annual instalments on November 19, 2017,
November 19, 2018 and November 19, 2019. Because these are make-whole awards, they are not considered to be a part of Mr. Kelly’s ongoing target annual compensation. Retirement and Other Benefits Our benefits program is
designed to be competitive and cost-effective. It is our objective to provide core benefits, including medical, retirement, life insurance, paid time off and leaves of absence, to all employees and to allow for supplementary non-core benefits to accommodate regulatory, cultural and practical differences in the various geographies in which we have operations. We sponsor a frozen tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, which we refer to as the retirement plan. We
also sponsor a tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan, which we refer to as the 401k plan, to provide market driven retirement benefits to all eligible employees in the United States. 57 Table of Contents We maintained a non-qualified excess retirement benefit plan
and a non-qualified excess 401k plan to make up for the limitations imposed on our tax-qualified plans by the Internal Revenue Code. New contributions to these non-qualified plans ceased effective February 1, 2014. We also sponsor an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which we refer to as the deferred
compensation plan, which allows executive officers and certain other highly compensated employees to defer a portion of their annual incentive awards and sign-on bonuses to help them with tax planning and to
provide competitive benefits. For additional information on these plans, see the sections entitled Executive Compensation – Pension Benefits Table for Fiscal Year 2017 and Executive
Compensation – Non-qualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2017. Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits We provide limited
perquisites and other personal benefits to facilitate the performance of our named executive officers’ management responsibilities. For instance, we maintain a company car and driver which allows for additional security that are used primarily
by the Chief Executive Officer for both business and personal use, as well as some business and limited personal use by other executive officers. From time to time, our named executive officers also may use the Company’s tickets for sporting,
cultural or other events for personal use rather than business purposes. If an incremental cost is incurred for such use, it is included in the “All Other Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2017 . In addition, we have a policy that allows for companion travel on business related flights on our corporate aircraft by the Chief Executive
Officer, the President and other key employees, as approved by the Chief Executive Officer. It is our policy that named executive officers are responsible for all income taxes related to their personal usage of the corporate car or aircraft, as well
as travel by their companions. Additionally, no named executive officer may use the corporate aircraft for exclusive personal use (not related to business) except under the terms and conditions outlined in the Company’s aircraft time sharing
agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, or under extraordinary circumstances with the advance approval of the Chief Executive Officer. Any personal use of the aircraft by our Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the aircraft time sharing
agreement requires him to reimburse Visa an amount (as determined by the Company) equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount that would, absent reimbursement, be reportable with respect to the Chief Executive Officer in the Summary Compensation
Table (which we refer to as the SEC Cost), or (ii) the expenses of operating such flight that may be charged pursuant to Federal Aviation Regulation Section 91.501(d) as in effect from time to time (which we refer to as the FAR
Expenses). The Chief Executive Officer’s personal use of the corporate aircraft is also subject to an annual cap of $500,000, as determined by the Company using the lesser of the SEC Cost and the FAR Expenses. As a result of this arrangement,
in fiscal year 2017, the Chief Executive Officer’s personal use of the aircraft resulted in no incremental cost to the Company. Please refer to the All Other Compensation Table for additional information about the other limited
perquisites and personal benefits provided to our named executive officers during fiscal year 2017. Severance We believe that it is appropriate to provide severance to an executive officer in certain circumstances. We do not provide for gross-ups for excise taxes that may be imposed as a result of severance payments and, for payments payable upon or following a change of control, we generally require a qualifying termination of employment in
addition to the change of control. Please see the section entitled Employment Arrangements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control – Executive Severance Plan for additional
information. Offer Letters with Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. and Vasant M. Prabhu We have outstanding obligations under executed offer letters with each of Mr. Kelly and Mr. Prabhu, in connection with their commencement of
employment by Visa. Please see the description of the offer letters in the section entitled Employment Arrangements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control – Offer Letters with Alfred F. Kelly and Vasant M.
Prabhu. 58 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2018 Compensation Long-Term Incentive Compensation On
November 8, 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the annual equity awards for our named executive officers to be granted on November 19, 2017, using a combination of 25% of the total value of equity awards in the form of stock
options, 25% in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units, and 50% in the form of performance shares. These are the same three equity vehicles and percentages used in prior years. For the performance shares awarded on November 19,
2017, the actual number of shares earned will be determined based on: • the annual EPS goal established for each of the three fiscal years in the performance period; and • an overall modifier based on our TSR Rank over the three-year performance period. Consistent with prior fiscal years, the total combined value of each equity award was approved by the Compensation Committee after considering the
practices of companies in our compensation peer group, the actual compensation levels of similarly situated executive officers of companies in our compensation peer group, corporate and individual performance during fiscal year 2017, recommendations
from our Chief Executive Officer (for awards to the named executive officers other than himself) and each named executive officer’s total compensation. The table below displays the total dollar value of the grants approved in November 2017 as
well as the dollar value of each component. Components Total Value of Equity Awards ($) Value of Stock Options ($) Value

adopted an equity grant policy, which contains procedures to prevent stock option backdating and other grant timing issues. Under the equity grant policy, the Compensation Committee approves annual grants to executive officers and other members of
the executive committee at a meeting to occur during the quarter following each fiscal year end. The Board has delegated the authority to Mr. Kelly as the sole member of the stock committee to make annual awards to employees who are not members
of the executive committee. The grant date for annual awards to all employees and non-employee directors has been established as November 19 of each year. 59 Table of Contents In addition to the annual grants, stock awards may be granted at other times during the year to new
hires, employees receiving promotions, and in other special circumstances. The equity grant policy provides that only the Compensation Committee may make such “off-cycle” grants to named executive
officers and other members of management’s executive committee. The Compensation Committee has delegated the authority to the stock committee to make “off-cycle” grants to other employees,
subject to guidelines established by the Compensation Committee. Any “off-cycle” awards approved by the stock committee or the Compensation Committee must be granted on the fourth business day after
we publicly announce our earnings or on such other date determined by the stock committee, Compensation Committee or the Board. For all newly
issued stock option awards, the exercise price of the stock option award will be the closing price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE on the date of the grant. If the grant date for the annual awards falls on a weekend, the exercise price
of stock option awards will be the closing price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE on the last trading day preceding the date of grant. Stock
Ownership Guidelines The Compensation Committee maintains stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers as follows: Officer Stock Ownership Guidelines Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. 6 x base salary Vasant M. Prabhu 4 x base salary Ryan McInerney 4 x base salary Rajat Taneja 4 x base salary Kelly Mahon Tullier 3 x base salary Equity interests that count toward the satisfaction of the ownership guidelines include shares owned outright by the
named executive officer, shares jointly owned, restricted stock and restricted stock units payable in shares. Newly hired or promoted executives have five years from the date of the commencement of their appointment to attain these ownership levels.
Each named executive officer currently meets or exceeds the applicable guideline set forth in the table above. If an executive officer does not meet the applicable guideline by the end of the five-year period, the executive officer is required to
hold a minimum of 50% of the net shares resulting from any future vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares or exercise of stock options until the guideline is met. These guidelines reinforce the importance of aligning
the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders and encourage our executive officers to consider the long-term perspective when managing the Company. Hedging and Pledging Prohibition As part of our insider
trading policy, all employees, including our named executive officers, and non-employee directors are prohibited from engaging in short sales of our securities, establishing margin accounts or otherwise
pledging or engaging in hedging transactions involving our securities. Policy Regarding Clawback of Incentive
Compensation We have a Clawback Policy pursuant to which named executive officers and other key executive officers may be required to
return incentive compensation paid to them if the financial results upon which the awards were based are materially restated due to fraud, intentional misconduct or gross negligence of the executive officer. 60 Table of Contents The Clawback Policy permits the Board to determine in its discretion if it will seek to recover
applicable compensation, taking into account the following considerations as it deems appropriate: • Whether the amount of any bonus or equity compensation paid or awarded during the covered time period, based on the
achievement of specific performance targets, would have been reduced based on the restated financial results; • The likelihood of success of recouping the compensation under governing law relative to the effort involved; • Whether the recoupment may prejudice Visa’s interest in any related proceeding or investigation; • Whether the expense required to recoup the compensation is likely to exceed the amount to be recovered; • The passage of time since the occurrence of the misconduct; • Any pending legal action related to the misconduct; • The tax consequences to the affected individual; and • Any other factors the Board may deem appropriate under the circumstances. Under the Clawback Policy, we can require reimbursement of all or a portion of any bonus, incentive payment, equity based award (including performance
shares, restricted stock or restricted stock units and outstanding stock options), or other compensation to the fullest extent permitted by law. Recoupment or reimbursement may include compensation paid or awarded during the period covered by the
restatement and applies to compensation awarded in periods occurring subsequent to the adoption of the Clawback Policy. We believe our Clawback
Policy is sufficiently broad to reduce the potential risk that an executive officer would intentionally misstate results in order to benefit under an incentive program and provides a right of recovery in the event that an executive officer took
actions that, in hindsight, should not have been rewarded. In addition, appropriate language regarding the policy has been included in applicable documents and award agreements and our executive officers are required to acknowledge in writing that
compensation we have awarded to them may be subject to reimbursement, clawback or forfeiture pursuant to the terms of the policy and/or applicable law. Tax Implications – Deductibility of Executive Compensation Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to deduct for tax purposes compensation in excess of $1,000,000 that is paid to our
principal executive officer or any one of our three highest paid executive officers, other than our principal executive officer or principal financial officer, who are employed by us on the last day of our taxable year unless, in general, the
compensation is paid pursuant to a plan that has been approved by our stockholders and is performance-related and non-discretionary. The Compensation Committee will review and consider the deductibility of
executive compensation under Section 162(m) and may authorize certain payments in excess of the $1,000,000 limitation. The Compensation Committee believes that it needs to balance the benefits of designing awards that are tax-deductible with the need to design awards that attract, retain and reward executives responsible for our success. In addition, Section 274(e) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the amount that companies can deduct for the personal use of corporate aircraft to
the amount recognized as income by the executives that used the aircraft. For fiscal year 2017, the total amount of our disallowed tax deduction resulting from the personal use of the corporate aircraft by our named executive officers and any guests
was $2,083,536. For information regarding the Compensation Committee’s review of compensation-related risk, please see the section entitled Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs . 61 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2017 The following table and related footnotes describe the total compensation earned for services rendered during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 by our

Pension Benefits Table for Fiscal Year 2017 The following table shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to our named executive officers and the number of years of service credited
to each executive, under the Visa Retirement Plan and the Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan. The value of the benefits is determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements. Name Plan Name Number of Years Credited Service (#) Present Value

The
number of years credited service differs from the years of vesting service as employer provided service credits ceased on December 31, 2015. Vesting service is as follows for each executive: Mr. Prabhu – 2.6 years,
Mr. McInerney – 4.3 years, Mr. Taneja – 3.8 years, Ms. Mahon Tullier – 3.3 years, Mr. Scharf – 4.1 years. Benefit accruals under the Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan
were discontinued effective February 1, 2014. Mr. Kelly is not an eligible participant in the Visa Retirement Plan or the Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan. 69 Table of Contents Visa Retirement Plan Under the Visa Retirement Plan, our U.S.-based employees, including our named executive officers, generally earn the right to receive certain benefits: • upon retirement at the normal retirement age of 65; • upon early retirement at or after age 55 (or at or after age 50 if hired prior to October 1, 2002) and having
completed at least ten years of service with us; or • upon an earlier termination of employment, but solely if the employee is vested at that time. Prior to January 1, 2011, retirement benefits were calculated as the product of 1.25% times the employee’s years of service multiplied by the
employee’s monthly final average earnings for the last 60 consecutive months before retirement (or, for employees hired prior to October 1, 2002, the product of 46.25% times the employee’s years of service divided by 25 years,
multiplied by the employee’s monthly final average earnings for the 36 highest consecutive months in the last 60 months before retirement). Eligible earnings include salary, overtime, shift differentials, special and merit awards and short-term
cash incentive awards. The formula below provides an illustration of how the retirement benefits are calculated. For employees hired on or before
September 30, 2002 46.25% Completed years of service, including partial year based on completed months / 25 years Monthly final average earnings for the 36 highest consecutive months in the last 60 months before retirement For employees hired after September 30, 2002 1.25% Completed years of
service, including partial year based on completed months (up to 35 full years) Monthly final average earnings for the last 60 consecutive months before retirement If an employee retires early, that is, between the ages of 55 and 64 (or between the ages of 50 and 61 if hired prior to
October 1, 2002), and has completed at least ten years of service with the Company, the amount of that employee’s benefits is reduced for each complete year that the employee begins receiving early retirement benefits before the age of 65
(or before the age of 62 if hired prior to October 1, 2002). If an employee retires prior to becoming eligible for early or normal retirement, the amount of his or her benefits is actuarially reduced and is generally not as large as if the
employee had continued employment until his or her early or normal retirement date. The Visa Retirement Plan began transitioning to cash balance
benefits effective January 1, 2008 and completed the transition effective January 1, 2011. The change to a cash balance benefit formula took effect immediately for employees hired or rehired after December 31, 2007. However, for
employees hired before January 1, 2008 (and not rehired thereafter), the applicable Visa Retirement Plan benefit formula described above was grandfathered for a three-year period and grandfathered employees continued to accrue benefits under
that benefit formula. Their accrued benefits at December 31, 2010 (the last day of the grandfathered period) or the date they terminated employment, if earlier, were preserved. Because we completed the conversion to a cash balance plan formula
beginning on January 1, 2011, all benefit accruals from that date until December 31, 2015 were under the cash balance benefit formula. Prior to January 1, 2016, under the cash balance plan formula, 6% of an employee’s eligible monthly pay was credited each month to the
employee’s notional cash balance account, along with interest each month on the 70 Table of Contents account balance at an annualized rate equal to the 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond average annual interest rate for November of the previous calendar year. The
employer provided credits described above ceased after December 31, 2015 and the Visa Retirement Plan had no new participants after that date. Interest credits continue to be provided on balances existing at the time of this freeze. Accrued
benefits under the Visa Retirement Plan become fully vested and nonforfeitable after three years of service. Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan Prior to February 1, 2014, we also provided for benefit accruals under an excess retirement benefit plan. To the extent that an employee’s
annual retirement income benefit under the Visa Retirement Plan exceeds the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, such excess benefit is paid from our non-qualified, unfunded, noncontributory Visa
Excess Retirement Benefit Plan. The vesting provisions of, and formula used to calculate the benefit payable pursuant to, the Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan are generally the same as those of the Visa Retirement Plan described above, except
that benefits are calculated without regard to the Internal Revenue Code tax-qualified plan limits and then offset for benefits paid under the qualified plan. Effective February 1, 2014, we discontinued
benefit accruals under the Visa Excess Retirement Benefit Plan. Non-qualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2017 Visa Deferred Compensation Plan Under the terms of the Visa
Deferred Compensation Plan, eligible participants are able to defer up to 100% of their cash incentive awards or sign-on bonuses, if they submit a qualified deferral election. Benefits under the Visa Deferred
Compensation Plan will be paid based on one of the following three distribution dates or events previously elected by the participant: (i) immediately upon, or up to five years following, retirement; (ii) immediately upon, or in the
January following, termination; or (iii) if specifically elected by the participant, in January in a specified year while actively employed. However, upon a showing of financial hardship and receipt of approval from the plan administrator, a
plan participant may be allowed to access funds in his or her deferred compensation account earlier than his or her existing distribution election(s). Benefits can be received either as a lump sum payment or in annual installments, except in the
case of pre-retirement termination, in which case the participant must receive the benefit in a lump sum. Participants are always fully vested in their deferrals under the Visa Deferred Compensation Plan. Upon
termination of the Visa Deferred Compensation Plan within 12 months of a “change of control,” participants’ benefits under the Visa Deferred Compensation Plan will be paid immediately in a lump sum. Visa 401k Plan and Visa Excess 401k Plan The Visa 401k Plan
is a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement savings plan pursuant to which all of our U.S.-based employees, including our named executive officers, are able to contribute up to 50%, or 13% for highly compensated
employees, of their salary up to the limit prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code to the Visa 401k Plan on a pre-tax basis. Employees also have the option of contributing on an after-tax basis from 1% up to 50%, or 13% for highly compensated employees, of salary or a combination of pre-tax and after tax contributions that do not exceed 50%, or
13% for highly compensated employees, of salary. All contributions are subject to the Internal Revenue Code limits. If an employee reaches the statutory pre-tax contribution limit during the calendar year, an
employee may continue to make contributions to the Visa 401k Plan on an after-tax basis, subject to any applicable statutory limits. During fiscal year 2017, we contributed a matching amount equal to 200% of the first 3% of pay that was contributed by employees to the Visa 401k Plan.
All employee and matching contributions to the Visa 401k Plan are fully vested upon contribution. 71 Table of Contents Prior to February 1, 2014, we also provided for a contribution in an excess 401k plan. Because
the Internal Revenue Code limits the maximum amount a company and an employee can contribute to an employee’s 401(k) plan account each year, we continued to provide the matching contribution, after the applicable Internal Revenue Code limits
are reached, to the Visa Excess 401k Plan, which is a non-qualified noncontributory retirement savings plan. Employees are eligible to participate in the Visa Excess 401k Plan if their salaries are greater
than the Internal Revenue Code pay cap or if the total of their contributions and our matching contributions to the Visa 401k Plan exceed the Internal Revenue Code benefit limit. The features of the Visa Excess 401k Plan are generally the same as
under the Visa 401k Plan, except that benefits cannot be rolled over to an IRA or another employer’s qualified plan. Effective February 1, 2014, we discontinued any future contributions to the Visa Excess 401k Plan. The following table provides information about each of our named executive officer’s contributions, earnings, distributions, and balances under the

Employment Arrangements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control The following discussion relates only to the offer letters with our named executive officers under which we still have outstanding
obligations during fiscal year 2017. We do not have fixed-term employment agreements with our named executive officers. Offer Letters with Alfred F. Kelly, Jr.
and Vasant M. Prabhu We executed offer letters with each of Mr. Kelly and Mr. Prabhu in connection with their employment by Visa.
Each of these offer letters was the result of negotiations with the Company, during which the Compensation Committee consulted with FW Cook, its independent compensation consultant, and legal counsel with expertise in executive compensation matters.
In connection with the negotiation of the offer letters the Compensation Committee also reviewed relevant market data, the compensation levels of our other executive officers, and the terms of each executive’s compensation arrangements with his
previous employer, including the value each would forfeit with such employer by agreeing to join Visa. Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. On October 17, 2016, we entered into an offer letter agreement with Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. under which he became Chief Executive Officer Designate as
of October 31, 2016 and was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer effective as of December 1, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the offer letter, Mr. Kelly receives an annual base salary of $1,250,000 and is eligible to participate in
our annual incentive plan for fiscal year 2017, with a target bonus of 250% of his base salary and a maximum bonus opportunity of 500% of his base salary. Mr. Kelly received a long-term equity incentive award with an aggregate grant date value
of $11,000,000, with $5,500,000 73 Table of Contents in performance shares, $2,750,000 in stock options and $2,750,000 in restricted stock units. This award was made at the same time and in the same general form as awards to other senior executives
of the Company on November 19, 2016, except that the provisions to qualify for retirement treatment were defined as age 60 and four years of service and six months of service from the date of grant. The standard provisions are age 55 and five
years of service and six months of service from the date of grant. On November 19, 2016, as required under the terms of his offer letter,
Mr. Kelly received a one-time “make-whole” equity award with a grant date value of $6,300,000 to compensate him for certain forfeited bonus opportunities with his prior employer. On
February 8, 2017, Mr. Kelly received an additional make-whole equity award of $1,000,000, after his prior employer failed to exercise certain call rights such that Mr. Kelly was unable to recover the cash value of his original equity
investment in his prior employer. These make-whole awards comprised of restricted stock units, which converted into 89,703 shares. The shares subject to the make-whole awards vest in three substantially equal installments on each of the three
anniversaries of the first quarterly grant date after Mr. Kelly’s commencement of employment, assuming his continued employment by the Company through each such date; provided, that upon the termination of his employment by the Company
without “cause” or his resignation of employment for “good reason” (each term as defined in the offer letter agreement), and subject to a release of claims against the Company and its affiliates in the form attached to our
Executive Severance Plan, Mr. Kelly will be entitled to twelve additional months of vesting. Further, in the event of Mr. Kelly’s death or “disability” (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan), the make-whole awards will
become fully vested. The make-whole awards will otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions of our equity incentive plan and their corresponding individual award agreements. In November 2016, we also entered into an aircraft time-sharing agreement with Mr. Kelly, which governs Mr. Kelly’s personal use of the
Company’s aircraft during his employment and his reimbursement of the Company for the costs of any such use. Please see the section entitled “ Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Perquisites and
Other Personal Benefits ” for additional information regarding this agreement. Vasant M. Prabhu On January 27, 2015, we executed an offer letter with Vasant M. Prabhu under which he became our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer on February 9, 2015. As negotiated in connection with the offer letter, and in order to compensate him for forfeited incentives from his prior employer, Mr. Prabhu was entitled to receive a one-time cash sign-on bonus of $2,500,000, a payment in the amount of $7,500,000 in January 2017, and a one-time make-whole
equity award structured in value and vesting to replicate the compensation he forfeited by leaving his former employer to join Visa. The make-whole equity award is comprised of restricted stock with a grant date value of approximately $7,500,000,
which converted into 113,012 shares. The shares subject to the make-whole award vest in three substantially equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Because the grant of the make-whole equity award and the sign-on bonus are one-time events, they are not considered to be a part of Mr. Prabhu’s ongoing target annual compensation. Pursuant to the terms of their offer letters, each of Mr. Kelly and Mr. Prabhu, are also eligible to participate in the Visa Inc. Executive
Severance Plan, the terms of which are discussed below . Executive Severance Plan We believe that it is appropriate to provide severance pay to an executive officer whose employment is involuntarily terminated by us without
“cause,” and, in some cases, voluntarily terminated by the executive for “good reason” (each as defined in the Executive Severance Plan), to provide transition income replacement that will allow the executive to focus on our
business priorities. We believe the level of severance provided by this Plan is consistent with the practices of our compensation peer group and is necessary to attract and retain key employees. Our named executive officers are participants in the Executive Severance Plan, which provides for lump sum severance upon a qualifying termination of
two times the sum of the executive’s base salary and target annual 74 Table of Contents incentive award, and a prorated bonus for any partial performance period under the annual incentive plan, along with continued health benefits for two years post-termination. The Executive
Severance Plan does not provide for any gross-ups for excise taxes imposed as a result of severance or other payments deemed made in connection with a change of control. Equity Incentive Awards Pursuant to the terms of certain
award agreements under the Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, if the employment of a named executive officer is involuntarily terminated by us without “cause” at any time or voluntarily terminated by the named executive
officer for “good reason” within two years following a change of control (as such terms are defined in the plan or applicable award agreement), then the unvested portion of any equity incentive award will become fully vested (and at target
levels, with respect to performance shares). There are generally no “single-trigger” payments available to named executive officers upon a change of control. Quantification of Termination Payments and Benefits The
following tables reflect the amount of compensation that would be paid to each of our named executive officers in the event of a termination of the executive officer’s employment under various scenarios. They do not include Mr. Scharf, as
he resigned from his employment with the Company effective as of December 1, 2016 and was therefore not an employee of the Company as of September 30, 2017. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of
September 30, 2017 and include estimates of the amounts that would be paid to each executive officer upon such executive officer’s termination. The tables only include additional benefits that result from the termination and do not include
any amounts or benefits earned, vested, accrued or owing under any plan for any other reason. Please see the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2017 Table, the Pension Benefits Table for Fiscal Year 2017 and the section
entitled Non-qualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2017 for additional information. Payments that would be made over a period of time have been estimated as the lump sum present value

ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS We are asking our Class A common stockholders to approve,
on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the section entitled Compensation Discussion and
Analysis, the compensation tables and the related narrative discussion. This proposal, commonly known as a “Say-on-Pay” proposal, gives our Class A
common stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers’ compensation. As described in detail under the
heading Compensation Discussion and Analysis above, our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain our named executive officers, who are critical to our success. Under these programs, our named executive
officers are rewarded for the achievement of specific annual, long-term, and strategic goals, corporate goals and the realization of increased stockholder value. Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy
statement for additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal year 2017 compensation of our named executive officers. The Say-on-Pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the
Company, the Compensation Committee or our Board. Our Board and the Compensation Committee value the views of our Class A common stockholders, and will carefully review and consider the voting results for this proposal when evaluating our
executive compensation programs. We currently conduct annual advisory votes to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, and we expect to conduct the next advisory Say-on-Pay vote at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. THE
BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. 78 Table of Contents PROPOSAL
3 –RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP The Audit and Risk Committee has appointed KPMG
LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the financial statements of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. KPMG has been our independent auditor since our initial public offering
in 2008, and KPMG audited our financial statements for fiscal year 2017. The Audit and Risk Committee periodically considers whether there should be a rotation of independent registered public accounting firms because the Audit and Risk Committee
believes it is important for the registered public accounting firm to maintain independence and objectivity. In determining whether to reappoint KPMG, the Audit and Risk Committee considered several factors including: • the length of time KPMG has been engaged; • KPMG’s independence and objectivity; • KPMG’s capability and expertise in handling the complexity of Visa’s global operations in our industry; • historical and recent performance, including the extent and quality of KPMG’s communications with the Audit and
Risk Committee, and feedback from management regarding KPMG’s overall performance; • recent PCAOB inspection reports on the firm; and • the appropriateness of KPMG’s fees, both on an absolute basis and as compared with its peers. The Audit and Risk Committee believes that the continued retention of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm
is in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders, and we are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2018. Although ratification is not required, the
Board is submitting a proposal to ratify KPMG’s appointment to our stockholders because we value our stockholders’ views and as a matter of good corporate practice. In the event that our stockholders fail to ratify KPMG as the
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, it will be considered a recommendation to the Audit and Risk Committee to consider the selection of a different firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit and Risk Committee may
in its discretion select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. A representative of KPMG will be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will
be available to respond to appropriate questions. THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF
KPMG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018. INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FEES The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed to the Company by KPMG for fiscal years 2017 and
2016 (in thousands): Services Provided Fiscal Year 2017 Fiscal Year 2016 Audit fees (1) $ 9,558 $ 8,810 Audit-related fees (2) 1,756 1,839 Tax fees (3) 824 218 All other
fees (4) 6 6 Total $ 12,144 $ 10,873 79 Table of Contents (1) Represents aggregate fees for professional services rendered in connection with annual financial statement audits, audits
of our internal control over financial reporting, preparation of comfort letters and consents related to SEC registration statements, quarterly review of financial statements and for services related to local statutory audits. (2) Represents aggregate fees for assurance and related audit services (but not included in the audit fees set forth above).
The assurance and related audit services include employee benefit plan audits, review of internal controls for selected information systems and business units (Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagement No. 18 audits), services related
to web trust certifications and consultations on financial accounting and reporting standards. (3) Represents aggregate fees for tax services in connection with the preparation of tax returns, other tax compliance
services, and tax planning services. (4) Represents fees for eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) services. Consistent with SEC and PCAOB requirements regarding auditor independence, the Audit and Risk Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting the
compensation for and overseeing the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. In accordance with its charter and the Audit and Risk Committee’s Pre-Approval Policy, the Audit and Risk
Committee is required to pre-approve all audit and internal control-related services and permitted non-audit services, including the terms thereof, to be performed for
us by our independent registered public accounting firm, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act that are approved by the Audit
and Risk Committee prior to the completion of the audit. During fiscal year 2017, all services KPMG provided to the Company were pre-approved by the Audit and Risk Committee in accordance with applicable SEC
regulations and the Pre-Approval Policy, and the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed and discussed the documentation KPMG supplied to it as to tax services and the potential effect of the provision thereof on
KPMG’s independence. To further help ensure the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm, we have adopted policies
and procedures relating to the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm and the hiring of employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm. 80 Table of Contents VOTING AND MEETING INFORMATION Information About Solicitation and Voting This proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board for use at the Annual Meeting to be held at the Le Méridien San Francisco, 333 Battery Street, San

on the basis of one vote for each share held. On December 1, 2017, there were 1,810,852,967 shares of Class A common stock outstanding. Stockholder
of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name If on December 1, 2017, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer
agent, Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, then you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As a stockholder of record, you may vote at the Annual Meeting or vote by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual
Meeting, we urge you to vote over the Internet or by telephone, or if you received paper proxy materials by mail, by filling out and returning the proxy card. For questions regarding your stock ownership, you may contact our transfer agent, Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, by telephone at (866) 456-9417 (within the U.S.) or +1 (651) 306-4433 (outside the U.S.). Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Nominee If on December 1, 2017, your shares of Class A common stock were held in an account with a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, then you are
the beneficial owner of the shares held in street name. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your nominee on how to vote the shares held in your account, and it has enclosed or provided voting instructions for you to use in directing
it on how to vote your shares. However, the organization that holds your shares is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. Because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the
Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from the organization that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting. 81 Table of Contents How to Vote If you are a stockholder of record, there are several ways for you to vote your shares: By mail. If you received
printed proxy materials, you may submit your vote by completing, signing and dating each proxy card received and returning it in the prepaid envelope. Sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card. Proxy cards submitted by mail must be
received no later than January 28, 2018 to be voted at the Annual Meeting By telephone. Instructions are shown on your proxy card. Via the Internet. Instructions are shown on your Notice of Internet
Availability. In person at the Annual Meeting. You may vote your
shares in person at the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, we recommend that you also submit your proxy card or vote by telephone or via the Internet by the applicable deadline so that your vote will be
counted if you later decide not to attend the meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Class A common stock, you should receive a Notice of Internet
Availability of Proxy Materials or voting instructions from the broker or other nominee holding your shares. You should follow the instructions in the Notice or the voting instructions provided by your broker or nominee in order to instruct your
broker or nominee on how to vote your shares. The availability of telephone and Internet voting will depend on the voting process of the broker or nominee. Shares held beneficially may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting only if you obtain a
legal proxy from the broker or nominee giving you the right to vote the shares. If the Annual Meeting is adjourned or postponed, your proxy will
still be effective and will be voted at the rescheduled or adjourned Annual Meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until the rescheduled or adjourned Annual Meeting. Change or Revoke a Proxy or Vote If you are a stockholder of record, you may change or revoke your vote before the completion of voting at the Annual Meeting by: • signing and returning a new proxy card with a later date; • submitting a later-dated vote by telephone or via the Internet, since only your latest telephone or Internet vote

your shares will be voted: • FOR the election of the ten director nominees named in this proxy statement; 82 Table of Contents • FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation paid to our named executive officers; and • FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for
fiscal year 2018. If you are a beneficial owner of Class A common stock and you do not provide the broker or other nominee
that holds your shares with voting instructions, the broker or nominee will determine if it has the discretionary authority to vote on your behalf. Under the NYSE’s rules, brokers and nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters such
as proposal 3, but do not have discretion to vote on non-routine matters such as proposals 1 and 2. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions to your broker or nominee, your broker or nominee may
only vote your shares on proposal 3 and any other routine matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. Brokers or other nominees
who hold shares of our Class A common stock for a beneficial owner have the discretion to vote on routine proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner at least ten days prior to the Annual Meeting. A
broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other nominee does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares. A quorum is required to transact business at our Annual Meeting. Stockholders of record holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
Class A common stock represented at the Annual Meeting either in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting constitute a quorum. If you have returned valid proxy instructions or attend the meeting in person, your shares will
be counted for the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum, even if you abstain from voting on some or all matters introduced at the meeting. In addition, broker non-votes will be treated as present
for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. The vote required to approve each proposal is set forth below. Proposal Vote Required Impact of Broker Non-Votes Impact of Abstentions 1 – Election of ten directors Majority of the Class A Shares Cast for Each Director Nominee (1) No Impact No Impact 2 – Approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation paid to our named executive officers Majority of the Class A Shares Entitled to

Annual Meeting Not Applicable Counts Against (1) Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require each incumbent director nominee to submit an irrevocable contingent
resignation letter prior to the mailing of the proxy statement for an annual meeting at which the nominee’s candidacy will be considered. If the nominee does not receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her re-election, meaning that he or she does not have more votes cast FOR than AGAINST his or her re-election, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will
recommend to the Board that it accept the nominee’s contingent resignation, unless the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines that acceptance of the resignation would not be in the best interest of the Company and its
stockholders. The Board will decide whether to accept or reject the contingent resignation at its next regularly scheduled meeting, but in no event later than 120 days following certification of the election results. The Board will publicly disclose
its decision and rationale. 83 Table of Contents Proxy Solicitor We will bear the expense of soliciting proxies. We have retained D.F. King & Co. to solicit proxies for a fee of $11,000 plus a reasonable

Sharing the Same Address The SEC has adopted rules that allow a company to deliver a single proxy statement or annual report to an
address shared by two or more of its stockholders. This method of delivery, known as “householding,” permits us to realize significant cost savings, reduces the amount of duplicate information stockholders receive, and reduces the
environmental impact of printing and mailing documents to our stockholders. Under this process, certain stockholders will receive only one copy of our proxy materials and any additional proxy materials that are delivered until such time as one or
more of these stockholders notifies us that they want to receive separate 85 Table of Contents copies. Any stockholders who object to or wish to begin householding may contact our Investor Relations Department at (650) 432-7644 or Investor
Relations, Visa Inc., P.O. Box 8999, San Francisco, CA 94128-8999.
