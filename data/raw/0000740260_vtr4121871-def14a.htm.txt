for Annual Meeting of Stockholders Table of Contents Letter to Ventas Stockholders Dear Fellow Stockholder, On behalf of our Board of Directors,
I am pleased to present the 2023 Ventas Proxy Statement and invite you to join our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 16, 2023. Over the past year, Ventas has
continued to deliver value to our stakeholders with strong financial performance and by taking decisive actions to position our
business for the future. We leveraged our deep expertise and strong relationships to drive operational excellence and create opportunities,
and we launched our powerful data analytics platform, Ventas Operational Insights (OI) TM , to accelerate the performance
of our assets. We have maintained our focus on curating and growing our diverse portfolio and our commitment to the organizational
strength, culture and values that power our long-term strategic priorities. Delivering Strong Financial
Performance In 2022, Ventas performed among
the top REITs in the S&P 500 and delivered total shareholder return that outperformed all major REIT benchmarks for the
year. With strong contributions across our businesses, we enjoyed the benefits of our diversified portfolio of assets, unified
in catering to the needs of the large and growing aging demographic. Our notable performance accomplishments include: Delivering total shareholder
    return that outperformed the Nareit Health Care Index by more than 13% and the MSCI US REIT Index by approximately 16% Delivering total company year-over-year same-store
    cash net operating income growth of 6.1%, led by the strong performance of our SHOP portfolio with 13.4% growth powered by
    Ventas OI™ Achieving record Medical Office Building (“MOB”)
    performance, complemented by strong contributions from our Life Science, Research & Innovation (“R&I”)
    portfolio Enhancing our financial strength and flexibility
    through opportunistically extending the Company’s debt duration Maintaining our BBB+ credit rating and receiving
    positive actions by all three rating agencies Curating and Growing our Diverse
Portfolio We completed or announced $1.2
billion in total investments in 2022, principally in senior housing, MOB and Life Science, R&I, with a continued focus on
capitalizing on favorable demographically led demand trends. We have taken decisive actions
in our SHOP portfolio to position Ventas to recapture NOI amid the multiyear growth and recovery cycle underway in senior housing.
In the past two years, we have converted more than 50 triple-net communities to SHOP and completed more than 130 transitions to
new operators to ensure we have the right partners in the right markets operating our assets. In that time, we also acquired more
than 100 new communities and executed 30 dispositions and eight new developments. Ventas OI™ continues to be a powerful
tool in the capital allocation process, as we leverage our vast and growing data advantage to generate industry and market-specific
insights that inform decisions around revenue-generating projects to maximize performance. In January, J. Justin Hutchens,
Executive Vice President, Senior Housing, was appointed to the additional role of Chief Investment Officer to oversee Ventas’s
capital allocation strategy and execution across the enterprise. By combining the Chief Investment Officer and EVP, Senior Housing
roles, we streamlined our executive management structure and enhanced the connection between our investment activity and business
operations to continue our long history of value creation. Maintaining our Commitment to
Organizational Strength, Culture and Values We know that diversity of thought,
experiences, perspectives and backgrounds drives better outcomes, and we continue our ongoing and rigorous focus on diversity.
Today, 50% of our Board members identify as diverse by gender or ethnicity, and as our Board has become more diverse, it has also
become more excellent. Since 2019, we have added four new Board members, including Sumit Roy, who we welcomed in October. A highly
accomplished REIT executive, Sumit brings deep industry knowledge and capital allocation expertise and a complementary skillset
that aligns with Ventas’s strategic vision. We also continued our board committee refreshment and the regular rotation of
committee chairmanships with the appointment of Melody Barnes as Chair of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility
Committee. We continue to lead at the forefront
of business efforts to address climate change and believe our sustainability leadership raises our returns. In 2022 we elevated
our sustainability targets, announcing a commitment to achieve carbon neutral operations by 2040, with a 30% decrease of absolute
carbon emissions by 2030. 2023 Proxy Statement i Table of Contents Accelerating our Strong Momentum We have begun 2023 with strong
momentum. We are well positioned to capitalize on the exciting demographically driven demand for our assets and to continue driving
sustainable value creation for our stockholders and broader stakeholders. Our experienced team is energized by the unprecedented
opportunity to capture organic growth over a multiyear time horizon, led by SHOP and supported by favorable supply-demand
fundamentals, actions we have taken in the portfolio and our post-pandemic rebound. We expect strong revenue growth in SHOP driven
by pricing improvements and a significant occupancy ramp throughout the year. We also expect to continue to benefit from our diverse
portfolio as we focus on operational excellence across our businesses. We look forward to continuing the
dialogue with our stockholders and are grateful for all the perspectives shared with us to date. Thank you for your investment
in our company and the trust you place in our team. Sincerely, Debra A. Cafaro Chairman and Chief

operates at the intersection of two large and dynamic industries—healthcare and real estate. Fueled by powerful demographic
demand from growth in the aging population, Ventas owns a diversified portfolio of over 1,200 properties in the United States,
Canada and the United Kingdom. Ventas uses the power of its capital to unlock the value of healthcare real estate. We hold a highly diversified portfolio
through three reportable business segments – triple-net leased properties (“NNN”), senior housing operating
properties (“SHOP”) and office properties (“Office”). Portfolio percentage based on Annualized
Adjusted NOI as of December 31, 2022. Annualized Adjusted NOI is a means of presenting Ventas’s portfolio composition and
is not used to monitor financial performance. For more than 20 years, Ventas
has pursued what we believe is a successful, enduring strategy built on diversification of property types, capital sources and
partners, financial strength and flexibility and strong environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives.
Working with industry-leading tenants, operators and partners, our collaborative and experienced team is focused on leveraging
our portfolio of properties to produce consistent, growing cash flows and superior returns on a strong balance sheet for the benefit
of our stockholders. In 2022, we delivered Nareit Funds From Operations (“FFO”) of $2.82 per share* and Normalized
FFO of $2.99 per share. 2 Table of Contents ABOUT

practices are essential to the long-term success of our business. Our industry-leading ESG program is designed to drive long-term
value creation through intentional actions and collective effort. We have developed an ESG strategy based on three
key pillars—People, Performance, Planet—that we believe are important to our company, stockholders and other stakeholders
and that have been validated through a GRI-aligned ESG materiality assessment. These pillars are supported by our foundational
values of health and safety and strong corporate governance. To hold ourselves accountable for progress, we set ambitious goals
for each of these key priority areas and provide updates about our performance through annual sustainability reporting. HEALTH & SAFETY Prioritizing Healthy Communities: We are committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and the residents,
tenants, caregivers and patients who live in and frequent our buildings. GOVERNANCE A Company Built on Ethics & Integrity: We seek to adhere to best-in-class governance practices. Integrity, transparency
and accountability are embedded in our culture, embraced by our Board of Directors, our leaders and our employees and reflected
in our business conduct. Core to our business, we have incorporated a comprehensive
ESG assessment into our due diligence process for acquisitions, dispositions, developments and major redevelopments, and selection
of new operators and partners. Considering these areas for evaluating business opportunities helps ensure that our business decisions
reflect our ESG priorities, consider ESG-related risks and align with our value-creation strategy. Reflecting our ongoing commitment to best-in-class
governance practices, in 2022, we expanded the role of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to include oversight
and monitoring of the Company’s ESG strategies, goals and initiatives including those relating to diversity, equity and
inclusion (“DE&I”). At the same time, we changed the name of the Committee to the Nominating, Governance and Corporate
Responsibility Committee, emphasizing the importance of the Committee’s role in the Board’s longstanding oversight
and monitoring of the Company’s DE&I and ESG strategies, goals and initiatives. Recognizing the importance of DE&I and influenced
by our engagement with stockholders, we began publishing our Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-1) data on our website this year. 2023 Proxy Statement 5 Table of Contents ABOUT VENTAS Achievements and Goals (1) People Our team drives our success and creates unmatched value. Ensuring our

statements regarding forward-looking information that should be carefully considered. Our statements and reports about our objectives
may include statistics or metrics that are estimates, which may make assumptions based on developments or standards that may change

proposals. This proxy summary provides limited information regarding each proposal. This summary does not contain all of the information
that you should consider, and you should read the entire Proxy Statement carefully before voting. 2023 Annual Meeting
Proposals The proposals that stockholders will be asked to vote on at
this meeting are as follows: Board
    Recommendation Page Reference Proposal 1: To elect the 11 director nominees named in the Proxy Statement to serve until the 2024 Annual
    Meeting of Stockholders FOR each Director Nominee listed on the proxy card 10 Proposal 2: To approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers FOR 47 Proposal 3: To recommend, on an advisory basis, the frequency with which we should hold future advisory
    votes regarding the compensation of our Named Executive Officers Every ONE Year 88 Proposal 4: To ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for
    the 2023 fiscal year FOR 89 Director Nominees Our Board has nominated 11 individuals for election as directors
at the Company’s 2023 Annual Meeting. All of our director nominees are currently members of our Board of Directors. Each
brings valuable skills and opinions, informed by their background and experience, to our deliberations and is an important contributor
to our Board and advisor to our management team. Additional information concerning the composition of our Board
and our director nominees can be found under Proposal 1: Election of Directors. Executive
Compensation The second item on the agenda is an advisory vote on our executive
compensation program. Our executive compensation program reflects our philosophy that compensation should be linked to performance,
align with stockholder experience and attract, retain and motivate talented employees. We benchmark our executive compensation
against that of our peers to ensure that our executives’ pay is appropriate based on their roles, responsibilities and years
of experience. A significant proportion of executive compensation—more than 80% of the 2022 compensation of our Named Executive
Officers—is in the form of equity and cash incentive awards tied to pre-identified performance measures such that an executive’s
realized pay is closely tied to the Company’s performance. Our 2022 executive compensation program reflects several changes
implemented in response to stockholder perspectives shared with us at the end of 2021, including, among other things, the reduction
in the value of the 2022 target compensation opportunity for our CEO by 14% and for our CFO and former CIO by 8%. The Board and
the Compensation Committee made additional changes to our executive compensation program for 2023 in response to the 2022 say-on-pay
vote and further engagement with our stockholders. Additional information regarding our executive compensation
program, including the changes discussed above, can be found in the section titled Proposal 2: Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation
of Our Named Executive Officers. 8 Table of Contents PROXY SUMMARY Frequency of Say-On-Pay Votes The third item on the agenda is an advisory vote regarding the frequency
with which we should hold future advisory votes on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. Regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) require us to hold an advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers
every one, two or three years, and require us to hold an advisory vote regarding the frequency of such votes every six years.
We currently hold an advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers every year and our Board is recommending
that we continue this practice. Additional information regarding this proposal can be found under Proposal
3: Advisory Vote to Recommend the Frequency with Which We Should Hold Future Advisory Votes regarding the compensation of our
Named Executive Officers. Auditors The fourth item on the agenda for the 2023 Annual Meeting is approval
of the selection of KPMG as our auditors for 2023. KPMG was first engaged to serve as our independent registered public accounting
firm in July 2014. We believe that the continued retention of KPMG to serve in this role for this fiscal year is in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders. Additional information regarding this proposal can be found under Proposal
4: Ratification of Fiscal 2023 Auditor Selection. 2023 Proxy Statement 9 Table of Contents Corporate Governance and Board Matters Proposal 1: Election of Directors At the 2023 Annual Meeting, stockholders will vote on the election of
the 11 director nominees listed on the following page, each of whom is currently a director of the Company, for a one-year term
of office. The Board has nominated the director nominees, on the recommendation
of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee, to serve until the 2024 Annual Meeting or until their successor
has been duly elected and qualified or their earlier resignation, death or removal. Each director nominee has indicated that he
or she will serve if elected. We do not anticipate that any of the director nominees will be unable or unwilling to stand for
election but, if that happens, your proxy may be voted for another person nominated by the Board, or the Board may reduce its
size, in each case, on the recommendation of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee. In nominating the following director nominees for election at the Company’s
2023 Annual Meeting, the Board has evaluated each director nominee by reference to the criteria described under the heading “Director
Recruitment, Nomination and Succession Planning.” In addition, the Board evaluates each individual director in the context
of the Board as a whole, with the objective of recommending a group that can best support the success of our businesses and represent
stockholder interests. The following section contains information provided by the director
nominees about their principal occupations, business experience and other matters, as well as a description of how each individual’s
experience qualifies him or her to serve as a director of the Company. The information reflects their respective ages and tenure
as of the 2023 Annual Meeting and their current committee and chair assignments. Our Board recommends that you vote FOR the election of each of the
11 director nominees to the Board of Directors listed on the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form. 10 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS Board Snapshot 2023

AND BOARD MATTERS Director Recruitment, Nomination
and Succession Planning In accordance with our Guidelines on Governance (our
“Guidelines”), the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee annually considers and recommends
to the Board a slate of director nominees for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders. In making its recommendations, the Nominating, Governance
and Corporate Responsibility Committee considers: high-performing, independent incumbent directors
    who have indicated a willingness to continue serving on our Board; candidates, if any, nominated by our stockholders in accordance
    with the Company’s organizational documents and applicable laws, including Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act
    of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”); and other candidates identified by the Nominating, Governance and Corporate
    Responsibility Committee. The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility
Committee also regularly reviews the size and composition of the Board on a holistic basis, utilizing the matrix of identified
skills, experience and qualifications disclosed above, and considers potential candidates during the course of the year on an
ongoing basis as part of our Board refreshment process. In recruiting and evaluating candidates, the Nominating,
Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee considers different perspectives, skill sets, education, ages, genders, racial
and ethnic demographics and other diversity factors, independence, conflicts of interest, outside commitments and business experience.
In general, the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee seeks to include on our Board a complementary mix
of individuals with diverse backgrounds, knowledge and viewpoints responsive to the broad set of challenges that the Company confronts. Our Guidelines provide that, in general, director
nominees should have one or more of the following qualifications: have demonstrated management or technical ability
    at high levels in successful organizations; are currently or have been employed in positions of significant
    responsibility and decision-making; have experience relevant to our operations, such as real estate,
    REITs, healthcare, finance or general management; be well-respected in their business and home communities; have time to devote to Board duties; and be independent from us and not related to our other directors or
    employees. Our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility
Committee looks for certain characteristics common to all Board members, including: integrity; independence; leadership ability, and a proven record of accomplishment; personal commitment of time and effort; expertise in business, professional, academic, political or community
    affairs; willingness to evaluate, challenge and stimulate; and candor. Our directors are expected to be active participants
in governing our enterprise. The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee seeks to recommend candidates who
have adequate time to devote to Board activities, recognizing that public company boards of directors command a significant portion
of directors’ time. Accordingly, the Company maintains an overboarding policy that prohibits anyone who serves as a Chief
Executive Officer of a public company from simultaneously serving on more than two public company boards in addition to the Company’s
Board and prohibits all other directors from simultaneously serving on more than four public company boards in addition to the
Company’s Board. The Company also prohibits Audit and Compliance Committee members from simultaneously serving on more than
two additional public company audit committees. Mr. Nolan, who is a current director and nominee,
serves on two public company boards in addition to the Company’s Board. He is the Chief Executive Officer of one of those
companies, and the other company is Social Capital Suvretta Holdings Corp. II, a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”)
where he serves as a non-executive director. The SPAC does not have significant operations and its initial term is set to expire
on July 2, 2023, subject to the right of its stockholders to elect to extend the term. The SPAC has publicly announced, and Mr.
Nolan has confirmed, that Mr. Nolan intends to resign as a director of the SPAC upon the earlier of the appointment of his successor
and July 31, 2023. 2023 Proxy Statement 25 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD
MATTERS The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility
Committee has carefully reviewed Mr. Nolan’s current time commitments, as it does for all director nominees, and assessed
whether he will have adequate time to carry out his responsibilities on the Board. The Committee determined that Mr. Nolan brings
valuable experience, qualifications and skills to our Board, has consistently demonstrated strong engagement and integrity and
is widely respected by fellow Board members for his informed and meaningful insights during Board discussions. In light of Mr.
Nolan’s experience, qualifications, skills, and his contributions and active engagement on the Board, the limited operating
nature of the SPAC, Mr. Nolan’s intent to resign as a director of the SPAC in the coming months and our assessment of his
continued commitment and availability to the Company, the Committee recommended that Mr. Nolan be reelected as a member of the
Board. No single factor or group of factors is necessarily
dispositive of whether a candidate will be recommended by our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee. The
Committee will consider candidates recommended by stockholders and applies these same standards in evaluating individuals in that
context. Candidates recommended by stockholders must meet the criteria and qualifications described above. Stockholders may submit
recommendations to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at 353 North Clark Street, Suite 3300, Chicago,
Illinois 60654. Director nominations by our stockholders must follow
the procedures described in the “Additional Information—Submission of Stockholder Proposals and Other Items for 2024
Annual Meeting” section of this Proxy Statement. Refreshment and Succession Planning The Board is committed to effective succession planning
and a rigorous, ongoing refreshment program. The average tenure of our independent director nominees is approximately six years
as of the date of the 2023 Annual Meeting. Including our CEO, the average tenure is less than eight years as of the date of the
2023 Annual Meeting. Our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee monitors the average tenure of our directors
and seeks to achieve a variety of director tenures in order to benefit from long-tenured directors’ institutional knowledge
and newly elected directors’ fresh perspectives. Since 2015, we have appointed seven new directors to the Board of Directors.
Robert B. Reed, a valued director who has served on the Board since 2008, will not be standing for re-election at the 2023 Annual
Meeting. In September 2022, we continued the ongoing refreshment
of the Board with the appointment of Sumit Roy as a director. Mr. Roy was identified as a candidate by a third-party search firm
and a non-management director. The search firm assisted the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee by identifying
a pool of potential director candidates based on specifications provided by the Committee. The firm reviewed potential candidates
with the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee, reached out to candidates selected from the pool to assess
interest and availability and arranged candidate interviews with members of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility
Committee and other members of the Board. The search firm also conducted reference checks and a background check on the candidate
before a final recommendation was made to the Board. In its annual review of the Board’s composition,
the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee considers succession planning in light of factors such as skills,
experience and qualifications needed, the Company’s strategy, director feedback from the annual Board self-evaluation, stockholder
perspectives shared during our annual engagement process and upcoming retirements and other potential departures. The Nominating,
Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee conducts an enhanced evaluation of any director with more than fifteen (15)
years of service on the Board and provides the Board with a detailed explanation as to the determinative factors for nominating
such director for another term if the Committee recommends that such candidate be nominated for election. 26 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
AND BOARD MATTERS Director Recruitment Our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility
Committee has the authority to identify, consider and recommend candidates to the Board. An overview of the Board’s director
recruitment process is provided below: Evaluate
    Board Composition The Nominating, Governance
    and Corporate Responsibility Committee periodically reviews Board composition and the skills, experience and qualifications
    held by existing directors and those sought in candidates, considering the needs of the Board in light of the Company’s
    strategy, director feedback (including from the annual Board self-evaluation), stockholder perspectives and upcoming retirements
    and other potential departures. Identify Candidates Based on its assessment of Board composition,
    the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee identifies a candidate profile to guide the Committee’s
    search and may retain a third-party search firm to assist in identifying and evaluating candidates. Candidates may also be
    recommended by our stockholders, existing directors, advisors and other sources. Assess
    Candidates Candidates are assessed against the
    criteria outlined in “—Director Recruitment, Nomination and Succession Planning” and the skills, experience
    and qualifications shown in “Board Nominees— Director Nominees Skills, Experience, Qualifications and Attributes
    Matrix,” as well as the future needs of the Board, including succession planning. The Committee, with the assistance
    of the Corporate Secretary, reviews candidates for independence and potential conflicts. Interview Candidates Qualified top candidates are interviewed
    by members of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and other Board members, as appropriate. Recommend Candidates The Nominating, Governance and Corporate
    Responsibility Committee recommends candidates to the Board for appointment or nomination for election. Stockholder

    and gender diversity Current
    and former CEOs All
    independent Expertise in investments, finance, accounting, investor perspectives/institutional investing, life sciences, technology, research and innovation, healthcare and REITs Independence Our Guidelines require that at least a majority of
the members of our Board meet the criteria for independence under the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).
For a director to be considered independent under the NYSE’s listing standards, the director must satisfy certain tests,
and the Board must affirmatively determine that the director has no direct or indirect material relationship (other than as a
director) with us. Not less than annually, our Board evaluates the independence of each non-management director on a case-by-case
basis by considering any matters that could affect their ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director, including all transactions and relationships between that director, members of their family and organizations with
which that director or their family members have an affiliation, on the one hand, and us, our subsidiaries and our management,
on the other hand. The Board has affirmatively determined that all of
the Company’s current directors and directors who served during 2022, with the exception of Ms. Cafaro, are independent
under the NYSE’s listing standards based on its most recent review upon application of the standards described above. Under
the NYSE listing standards, Ms. Cafaro is not considered independent due to her employment as our CEO. 2023 Proxy Statement 27 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD
MATTERS The Board has also determined that: all of the members of the Audit and Compliance
    Committee are independent under the applicable rules of the NYSE the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
    respectively; and all of the members of the Compensation Committee are independent,
    non-employee directors, under the applicable rules of the NYSE and the SEC respectively. In determining that Mr. Lustig is independent, the
Board considered that he is employed by Lazard, a large multi-national financial institution that, with its affiliates, has provided
financial advisory and investment banking services in the ordinary course of business to the Company and its subsidiaries, for
which Lazard has received customary compensation, fees and expense reimbursement. The Board did not believe that the Company’s
relationship with Lazard impacted the independence of Mr. Lustig for the following reasons: Lazard is a large multi-national financial institution
    and the Company had a relationship with Lazard for many years prior to Mr. Lustig’s appointment to the Board; and amounts paid by the Company to Lazard for the services described
    above represent an immaterial percentage of Lazard’s and its affiliates’ gross revenues, are well below the amounts
    that would preclude a finding of independence under the NYSE listing standards and are immaterial to Mr. Lustig. Director Resignation Policy In accordance with our Director Resignation Policy,
our Board will nominate an incumbent director for election only if the director agrees that, in the event the director fails to
receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election at our annual meeting, they will tender an irrevocable resignation
that will be effective upon acceptance by the Board. If an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of votes cast in an
uncontested election at our annual meeting, our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee will act on an expedited
basis to determine whether to recommend acceptance or rejection of the director’s resignation and submit its recommendation
for prompt consideration by the Board. Our Board will act on the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee’s
recommendation and publicly disclose its decision regarding the tendered resignation by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with
the SEC no later than 90 days following certification of the election results. Director Retirement Policy Under our Guidelines, a non-management director is
required to retire at the first annual meeting of stockholders following their 75th birthday. On the recommendation of our Nominating,
Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee, our Board may waive this requirement if it deems a waiver to be in our best
interests and the best interests of our stockholders. Annual Board Self-Evaluation The Board recognizes that a robust and constructive
evaluation process is an essential component of good corporate governance and Board effectiveness. The Board and each of its committees
conduct self-evaluations through completion of written questionnaires related to their performance on an annual basis. Through
this process, directors provide feedback and assess Board, committee and director performance, including areas where the Board
believes it is functioning effectively and areas where the Board believes it can improve. The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility
Committee supervises the annual self-evaluations and uses various processes to solicit feedback, including periodic interviews
conducted by the Chair of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee with each of the other directors.
The Board and each committee review and discuss the evaluation results and take this information into account when assessing the
qualifications of the Board and further enhancing the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. Director Orientation and Continuing
Education New directors typically participate in an orientation
coordinated by the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and management. New directors engage with senior
management to review the Company’s strategic plans, significant financial, accounting and risk management matters, compliance
programs, corporate governance practices, key policies, principal officers, internal and independent auditors and other key service
providers. We provide new directors with written materials to supplement the management meetings to permit them to further understand
our business and industry. Informally, our directors also meet individually with new directors as part of the new director onboarding. We expect our directors to be well informed about
the Company’s business, the competitive landscape in which the Company operates and issues currently affecting the Company,
the healthcare and life science, research and innovation industries, the real estate investment trust industry, matters of corporate
governance and the broader economy. Because our Board believes that ongoing director education is vital to the development of
best practices and helps directors fulfill their fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders, directors are encouraged
to participate in continuing education programs. The Company covers the fees, costs and expenses associated with attendance at
one director education program per year for each director. 28 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

MATTERS Corporate Governance Guidelines Our Guidelines reflect the fundamental corporate governance
principles by which our Board and its committees operate. They set forth general practices the Board and its committees follow
with respect to structure, function, organization, composition and conduct. These Guidelines are reviewed at least annually by
the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and are updated periodically in response to changing regulatory
requirements, evolving corporate governance practices, input from our stockholders and otherwise as circumstances warrant. In
2022, the Board approved, on the recommendation of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee, several
enhancements to the Guidelines, including among other things, to clarify and more clearly articulate the responsibilities of the
Company’s Lead Independent Director (which position was previously referred to as the Presiding Director). Independent Compensation Advisor The Compensation Committee has retained an independent
compensation advisor, Semler Brossy Consulting Group (“Semler Brossy”), to provide advice regarding the overall executive
and non-employee director compensation programs, including (i) selecting appropriate peer companies for benchmarking purposes;
(ii) setting base salaries and incentive award opportunities; (iii) establishing and evaluating achievement of applicable performance
measures and related goals under our incentive plans; (iv) determining annual cash and long-term equity incentive awards for our
executive officers; and (v) setting cash and equity award levels for our non-employee directors. Semler Brossy reports to the Compensation Committee
and received no fees from us that are unrelated to its role as advisor to our Board and its committees during the year ended December
31, 2022. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the scope
of work provided by Semler Brossy, as required under the Compensation Committee Charter. After considering the specific independence
factors set forth in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act and all other relevant facts and circumstances, the Compensation Committee
concluded in its reasonable business judgment that Semler Brossy met the independence criteria and determined that Semler Brossy’s
work for the Board and its committees during 2021 raised no conflict of interest. Transactions with Related Persons We did not have any related persons transactions during
2022. Our Guidelines on Transactions with Related Persons
and our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct outline our standards and procedures regarding transactions with related persons.
Any transaction involving us in which any of our directors, officers or 5% or greater stockholders (or their immediate family
members) has a direct or indirect material interest must be approved or ratified by the Audit and Compliance Committee, the disinterested
members of our Board or, in certain limited circumstances, the Chair of our Audit and Compliance Committee. Our directors, officers
and employees are required to disclose any existing or proposed transaction in which they have a personal interest, or in which
there is or might appear to be a conflict of interest, to our General Counsel in writing. Our General Counsel reviews these matters
with the Lead Independent Director to determine whether the transaction raises a conflict of interest that warrants review and
approval by the Audit and Compliance Committee or the disinterested members of the Board. In determining whether to approve or
ratify a transaction, the Audit and Compliance Committee or disinterested members of the Board consider all relevant facts and
circumstances and such other information as they deem appropriate, based on the information available to them. Prohibition on Hedging and Pledging
of Our Securities Our Securities Trading Policy includes restrictions
on both hedging and pledging of Company securities. Specifically, the policy: prohibits our directors, executive officers
    and employees and certain of their related persons from buying or selling any put or call options, warrants or similar derivative
    instruments with respect to Company securities, or any other financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any
    decrease in the market value of Company securities; prohibits directors, executive officers and employees from engaging
    in “short sales” with respect to Company securities; and prohibits our directors and executive officers from holding our
    securities in margin accounts or otherwise pledging our securities to secure loans. No director or executive officer hedged, pledged or
held our securities in margin accounts at any time during 2022. 30 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
AND BOARD MATTERS Codes of Ethics, Human Rights and
Vendor Code of Conduct Our Global Code of Ethics
and Business Conduct sets forth the legal and ethical standards for conducting our business. All of our directors and
employees, including our CEO, our CFO and the directors, officers and employees of our subsidiaries must comply with our
Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and the policies that support it. Our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
covers significant areas of professional conduct, including employment practices, conflicts of interest, unfair or unethical
use of corporate opportunities, protection of confidential information and other Company assets, compliance with applicable
laws and regulations, political activities and other public policy matters and proper and timely reporting of financial
results. See also “— Public Policy Matters.” Our Human Rights Policy reflects our commitment to
upholding human dignity and equal opportunity in all of our business functions under principles outlined in the United Nation’s
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our Vendor Code of Conduct is designed to educate our suppliers about our expectations
for ethical and responsible business dealings, including upholding human rights, protecting health and safety and pursuing environmental
sustainability. Our expectation is that our vendors will treat people with respect and dignity, encourage diversity, promote equal
opportunity for all and create an ethical and inclusive culture. Our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Human
Rights Policy and Vendor Code of Conduct are available in the Corporate Governance section of our website (which is not a part
of the Proxy Statement) at www.ventasreit.com . We also provide copies of our Global Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct, Human Rights Policy and Vendor Code of Conduct, without charge, upon request to our Corporate Secretary
at our principal executive offices at 353 North Clark Street, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois 60654. Public Policy Matters We are committed to ethical business conduct. In our
Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, our Global Anti-Corruption Policy and our Political Contribution, Expenditure and
Activity Policy, we have established policies and practices with respect to political contributions and other public policy matters.
We do not use corporate funds or resources for direct contributions to federal political candidates, parties or campaigns. On
an annual basis, we publish a comprehensive list of our corporate contributions to state and local political candidates, political
parties and initiatives. Political contributions, expenditures and activities of certain officers and employees providing real
estate investment advisory services for private capital sources through our Ventas Investment Management business are subject
to additional restrictions, certifications and training requirements. Board Leadership Structure Our Board recognizes that one of its key responsibilities
under our Sixth Amended and Restated By-Laws (the “By-Laws”) and Guidelines is to evaluate and determine its optimal
leadership structure so as to provide effective oversight of management and a fully engaged, high-functioning Board. The Board
understands that no single approach to Board leadership is universally accepted and that the appropriate leadership structure
may vary based on a company’s size, industry, operations, history and culture. Consistent with this understanding, our Board, led
by our independent Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee, annually assesses its leadership structure in
light of our operating and governance environment at the time to achieve the optimal model for us and for our stockholders. Following
its most recent review, the Board determined that our existing leadership structure—under which our CEO also serves as Chairman
of the Board and a Lead Independent Director assumes specific responsibilities on behalf of the independent directors—is
effective, provides the appropriate balance of authority between those persons charged with overseeing our Company and those who
manage it on a day-to-day basis and achieves the optimal governance model for us and for our stockholders. 2023 Proxy Statement 31 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD
MATTERS Chairman The Chairman of the Board is elected annually by the
independent directors at the first Board meeting following the election of directors at the Company’s annual meeting of
stockholders. Ms. Cafaro has served as CEO and Chairman of the Board
since 2003, and our Board continues to believe that her combined role is most advantageous to us and our stockholders. Ms. Cafaro
possesses extensive knowledge of the issues, opportunities and risks facing us, our business and our industry and has consistently
demonstrated the vision and leadership necessary to focus the Board’s time and attention on the most critical matters and
to facilitate constructive dialogue among Board members on strategic issues. Moreover, the combined roles enable decisive leadership,
clear accountability and consistent communication of our message and strategy to all of our stakeholders. These leadership attributes
are uniquely important to our Company given the value to our business of opportunistic capital markets execution, our history
of rapid and significant growth and our culture of proactive engagement and risk management. Lead Independent director Our Guidelines require that our independent directors
annually elect one independent director to serve as Lead Independent Director (which position was previously referred to as the
Presiding Director) if the Chairman is not an independent director. Mr. Shelton was elected by the independent directors in May
2022 to serve as Lead Independent Director. In 2022, the Board approved, on the recommendation of the Nominating, Governance and
Corporate Responsibility Committee, several enhancements to the Company’s Guidelines on Governance, including, among other
things, to clarify and more clearly articulate the responsibilities of the Company’s Lead Independent Director. Annual

AND BOARD MATTERS Board Roles and Responsibilities Overview Our directors provide guidance and strategic oversight
to management and review and regularly monitor the effectiveness of the Company’s financial and business plans, policies
and decisions, including the execution of its strategies and objectives. The Board is responsible for, among other things: overseeing the Company’s strategy, including
    major financial objectives, plans and actions; overseeing and evaluating the Company’s performance and management
    of the Company’s business; overseeing the processes established by management to assess, monitor
    and mitigate the major risks facing the Company; nominating, compensating and evaluating directors; selecting, compensating, evaluating and, when necessary, replacing
    the CEO and other executive officers and overseeing compensation policies generally applicable to employees of the Company; overseeing the implementation of policies and procedures designed
    to ensure legal and ethical conduct of the Company’s business activities, strong internal controls and fiscal accountability; making provision for a succession plan for the CEO and other executive
    officers; and evaluating the Board’s and its committees’ structure,
    processes and performance. Board Meetings Our Board held a total of nine meetings during
        2022. Each of our incumbent directors attended more
        than 75% of the total meetings of the Board and the Board committees on which they served during 2022; average attendance
        was 95%. We strongly encourage, but do not require,
        directors to participate in our annual meetings of stockholders. Nine of the eleven directors who were nominated for election
        at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders participated in that meeting. Regular Executive Session Our independent directors meet in executive session,
outside the presence of management, at each regularly scheduled quarterly Board meeting and committee meeting, and at other times
as necessary or desirable. The Lead Independent Director chairs all regularly scheduled executive sessions of the Board and all
other meetings of the independent directors. Risk Management Management has primary responsibility for identifying
and managing our exposure to risk, subject to active oversight by our Board of the processes we establish to assess, monitor and
mitigate that exposure. The Board, directly and through its committees, routinely discusses our significant enterprise risks with
management and reviews the guidelines, policies and procedures we have in place to manage those risks. At Board and committee meetings, directors engage
in analyses and dialogue regarding specific areas of risk, including our enterprise risk management process. This process enables
our Board to focus on the strategic, financial, operational, legal, regulatory and other risks that are most significant to us
and our business in terms of likelihood and potential impact and ensures that our enterprise risks are well understood, mitigated
to the extent reasonable and consistent with the Board’s view of our risk profile and risk tolerance. As part of management’s
enterprise risk management process, management briefs the Audit and Compliance Committee on information and cybersecurity risks
and programs at least annually. Management identifies and assesses information security risks using industry practices aligned
to recommendations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and engages independent security firms to conduct periodic
penetration tests in order to identify and remediate vulnerabilities. The Company has not experienced any material information
security breaches in the last three years and, as such, has not incurred any expenses related to information security breaches
in the last three years. The Company believes it is adequately insured against losses related to a potential information security
breach. 2023 Proxy Statement 33 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD

        risks associated with non-executive director independence, when applicable The chair of each committee reports to the full Board
at each regularly scheduled Board meeting and other times as appropriate, including regarding risk matters considered by the committee. Our Board believes that this division of responsibilities
is the most effective approach for identifying and addressing risk. Through Ms. Cafaro’s combined role as CEO and Chairman,
our Board leadership structure appropriately supports the Board’s role in risk oversight by facilitating prompt attention
by the Board and its committees to the significant enterprise risks identified by management in our day-to-day operations. Human Capital Risk Management The Compensation Committee provides oversight on certain
human capital matters, including select DE&I efforts and goals. We report on human capital matters at each regularly scheduled
meeting of our Compensation Committee and of our Board. The most significant human capital measures and objectives that we focus
on include talent attraction and retention and development, culture, DE&I and health, safety and wellness. COVID-19 Risk Management The Board continues to monitor the risk landscape
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its extended consequences. Management periodically reports to the Board regarding the
impact of the pandemic on our business. 34 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
AND BOARD MATTERS Compensation Risk Assessment As part of its risk oversight role, our Compensation
Committee annually considers, together with its independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy, whether our compensation policies
and practices for all employees, including our executive officers, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on our Company. In conducting its risk assessment, the Compensation Committee reviewed a report prepared by management
regarding our existing compensation plans and programs, in the context of our business risk environment. In its review, the Compensation
Committee noted several design features of our compensation programs that reduce the likelihood of excessive risk-taking, including
the following: review and approval by the Compensation Committee
    (and in the case of the CEO, the independent members of the Board) of the compensation structure, plan and awards for our
    executive officers and the aggregate value of awards for other employees; advice of an independent compensation consultant on executive compensation
    levels and program design; regular review of comparative compensation data to maintain competitive
    compensation levels in light of our industry, size and performance; a balanced mix of compensation with a strong emphasis on variable
    compensation and long-term equity awards; incentive award opportunities that (i) do not provide minimum guaranteed
    payouts, (ii) have capped payouts and (iii) are based on a range of performance outcomes; equity compensation—in the form of Performance Stock Units
    or Restricted Stock Units—to provide greater incentive to create and preserve long-term stockholder value and discourage
    excessive risk-taking; performance measures used for incentives are based on our business
    strategy and often in tension with each other in order to balance risk, such as goals to promote FFO growth and maintain a
    strong balance sheet; time-based awards further align management to stockholder interests
    and discourage excessive risk-taking in pursuit of shorter-term financial objectives; equity incentive awards granted for future performance with multi-year
    vesting schedules/performance periods to enhance retention; and other policies, such as executive stock ownership guidelines, our
    recoupment policy and prohibition on hedging and pledging activities that further align executive and stockholder interests. Based on its evaluation, the Compensation Committee
has determined, in its reasonable business judgment, that our compensation practices and policies for all employees do not create
risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our Company and instead promote behaviors that support long-term
sustainability and stockholder value. Management Succession Planning Our Board regularly reviews short- and long-term succession
plans for the CEO and other senior management positions. In assessing possible CEO candidates, our independent directors identify
the skills, experience and attributes they believe are required to be an effective leader in light of the Company’s strategic
plan, business opportunities and challenges. The Board employs a similar approach with respect to evaluating possible candidates
for other senior management positions. In general, the Board’s management succession planning is designed to anticipate
both “planned” successions, such as those arising from anticipated retirements, and unexpected successions, such as
those occurring when an executive departs suddenly to take a new position, or due to death, disability or other unforeseen events. Our Board has adopted an emergency succession plan
to facilitate the transition to both interim and long-term leadership in the unlikely event of an unexpected vacancy in the position
of CEO. 2023 Proxy Statement 35 Table of Contents Corporate

Leadership selection and Chair rotation The Nominating, Governance and Corporate
Responsibility Committee annually reviews and determines the makeup of the Board’s committees and committee chairs, with a view
toward balancing the benefits derived from continuity against the benefits derived from diversity of experience and the viewpoints of
each committee’s members. Our Guidelines specify a rigorous annual evaluation process to determine whether to rotate a committee
chair after a director’s service as a particular committee chair approximates five years. This evaluation process is conducted
on a holistic basis and a chair’s years of service on a committee is a single factor in the analysis rather than a sole determinant
as to whether a committee’s leadership position should be rotated. Committee chair rotations may occur sooner or later than after
a director has reached five years of service as a committee chair. Recent Committee Changes During 2022: James D. Shelton was replaced by
    Melody C. Barnes as the Chair of our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee; Michael J. Embler was appointed to our Audit and Compliance
    and Investment Committees; Sean P. Nolan and Marguerite M. Nader were appointed
    to our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee; Sumit Roy was appointed to our Investment Committee;
    and Maurice S. Smith was appointed to our Compensation
    Committee. In 2022, we eliminated the Executive Committee
of the Board. The Executive Committee was originally established to act on behalf of the Board during an emergency if the Board was unable
to convene quickly, which is a “backstop” mechanism that is in place at many public companies. The Board has concluded that
an Executive Committee is no longer needed, given the demonstrated commitment of the members of the Board to make themselves available
for Board discussions, including when extended notice cannot be provided. The Executive Committee has never needed to meet, and the ease
with which the Board is able to convene electronically has increased in the last several years. Committee Charters Our Audit and Compliance Committee, Compensation
Committee, Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and Investment Committee each operates under a written
charter. The charters of our Audit and Compliance Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility
Committee are available in the Corporate Governance section of our corporate website at www.ventasreit.com .
We also provide copies of these charters, without charge, upon request to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices

Governance and Board Matters Stockholder Engagement Our Board and senior management value
frequent and regular engagement with our stockholders to promote transparency, improve our understanding of stockholder perspectives
and increase the Board’s accountability to stockholders. We maintain an active, broad-based stockholder outreach program, communicating
with and seeking input from stockholders on issues of importance to them, including a variety of topics related to our corporate governance
practices, executive compensation, ESG matters and business strategy. Our stockholder engagement and outreach
activities are conducted year-round, as detailed in the table below, and generally occur in the following contexts: Our executive officers, investor relations team and other members of senior management share information and speak with investors in a variety of settings and formats. During a typical year, we deliver presentations at industry conferences, hold investor calls, attend analyst-sponsored meetings with investors and engage in small group and one-on-one conversations with investors. Our Board has led a proactive stockholder outreach program for over a decade. Each Spring, Fall and at other times throughout the year as appropriate, the Board invites our top 50 stockholders, and others who ask to be included, to engage in a direct dialogue with us through participation in individual meetings. In connection with this program, we invite stockholders to engage with us about our corporate governance practices, executive compensation, ESG matters, business strategy and other priorities that are important to them.

of the stockholders we contacted confirmed that they did not view a discussion to be necessary or did not respond to our request. Our engagement effort was led by the Chair
of the Compensation Committee, Roxanne Martino. Other members of the Board also participated, including James D. Shelton, Lead Independent
Director, Melody Barnes, Chair of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee, Matthew Lustig, Chair of the Investment
Committee, Walter Rakowich, Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee Chair and Sean Nolan, member of the Compensation and Nominating,
Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committees. At least one independent director participated in each call; at least two independent
directors participated in many of the calls. Management representatives from our legal, investor relations and ESG teams also participated. 2023 Proxy Statement 39 Table of Contents Corporate
Governance and Board Matters Discussions in the Spring and Fall of 2022 focused on corporate
governance, Board refreshment, our ESG programs and corporate strategy and financial performance. Executive compensation was
discussed in the Spring and was a particular focus in the Fall. At our 2022 Annual Meeting, the advisory say-on-pay proposal
received 48.9% support of votes cast, including abstentions. The Compensation Committee and the full Board of Directors took
this vote outcome seriously, intensifying our robust, Board-led investor outreach effort in the Fall to understand the full
range of stockholder perspectives that drove the decline in the say-on-pay support and to develop appropriate responsive
actions, as described in more detail below. Throughout our discussions in the Spring
and Fall, stockholders were generally supportive of our ESG program, including our commitment to DE&I, and our responsiveness to
stockholders. Stockholders generally expressed the view that ESG matters should continue to be an expanding focus for management and
the Board. In addition, stockholders stressed a continued focus on long-term TSR performance and capital allocation. Stockholders generally
expressed recognition of and support for actions taken during 2022, including: Enhancing investor communications,
    including the appointment of BJ Grant as SVP, Investor Relations and expanded disclosure practices; Amending the Company’s bylaws to remove the supermajority
    vote requirement for bylaw amendments; Continuing the ongoing refreshment of the Board and
    its committees, including the appointments of Marguerite Nader in 2020, Maurice Smith in 2021 and Michael Embler and Sumit Roy in
    2022 and the appointment of Roxanne Martino as Chair of the Compensation Committee in 2021 and Melody Barnes as Chair of the Nominating,
    Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee in 2022; Eliminating the Executive Committee of the Board; Clarifying the role of the presiding director, including
    by changing the title to lead independent director and updating the description of the lead independent director’s duties in
    our guidelines on governance; and Announcing a commitment to achieve carbon neutral operations
    by 2040, with a decrease of absolute carbon emissions by 30% by 2030. While stockholders had diverse and sometimes
opposing views on various aspects of our executive compensation program, a majority of stockholders we spoke with were generally supportive
of our approach to executive compensation and enhancements we implemented over the last few years, including in 2022. For instance, a
number of stockholders expressed support for changes to the 2022 executive compensation program that were implemented in response to
stockholder perspectives that were shared with us at the end of 2021, which included reducing the value of the 2022 target compensation
opportunity for our CEO by 14% and for our CFO and former CIO by 8%. Many stockholders expressed concern regarding
the design of the 2021 annual incentive plan—in particular, the use of two half-year performance periods, the reliance on strategic
as opposed to quantitative corporate performance measures and the weighting of individual performance at 50%. As a result of these elements,
our stockholders viewed the 2021 annual incentive plan as being overly discretionary. Certain stockholders shared that they
appreciated the Compensation Committee’s effort to retain key employees during the COVID-19 pandemic—one of the most challenging
times for our industry—by establishing a special long-term equity retention program in 2021. However, some stockholders expressed
concern regarding grants made under that program to executives other than our CEO and the lack of performance vesting conditions in the
design of those awards. Stockholders also expressed a preference
for more year-over-year consistency in the performance measures and weightings used in our incentive programs absent a compelling business
justification for taking a different approach. Many stockholders expressed strong support for our use of DE&I metrics in our long-term
incentive plan and asked for additional disclosure regarding those metrics. In response to this and other feedback
received during our 2022 stockholder engagement program, we: In our 2023 annual incentive plan: Returned to our pre-pandemic practice of establishing
    full-year goals for all performance measures; Increased the weighting of the corporate performance
    measures to 75%, higher than the weighting in both our 2022 program and our pre-pandemic program; Simplified the corporate performance measures by reducing
    the number of measures in our 2023 annual incentive plan from four to three, all of which are financial in nature, and adopted measures
    that are more consistent with those used in our 2022 and pre-pandemic annual incentive plans; Included in this Proxy Statement enhanced disclosures
    around the annual incentive plan design and final payouts determination (see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Annual
    Incentive Compensation”); 40 Table of Contents Corporate
Governance and Board Matters In our 2023 long-term incentive
    plan, adopted performance measures and weightings that are identical to those used in our 2022 long-term incentive plan; Included in this Proxy Statement is a reaffirmation
    from the Compensation Committee that special awards should be rare, it will not grant any special awards to executive officers absent
    compelling circumstances and any special awards granted in the future will include a performance component unless the Committee determines
    that inclusion of a performance component would defeat the purpose of the special award (see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2022
    Say-On-Pay Vote and Stockholder Engagement—Key Topics Discussed with Stockholders”); Included in this Proxy Statement additional disclosure
    regarding the DE&I measures used to assess performance under our 2020-2022, 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 Performance Units (see “Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis—Executive Compensation Philosophy—Performance Measures and How They Are Linked to Our Strategy—DE&I
    Metrics”) and “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2022 Executive Compensation—Long-Term Equity Incentive
    Compensation—PSU Awards—2002-2022 PSU Performance and Payouts”). As in past years, we continued to see
a division among our stockholders regarding the use of TSR-based metrics in our long-term incentive plan, with some stockholders expressing
a preference for less emphasis on TSR and a majority expressing strong support for maintaining TSR as a dominant metric. Additional information regarding comments
concerning our executive compensation program, and some of the actions we have taken in response, are discussed in the “Compensation
Discussion and Analysis—2022 Say-On-Pay Vote and Stockholder Engagement” section of this Proxy Statement. Contacting the Board of

Compensation Our Board believes that the compensation
paid to our non-employee directors should (i) be competitive with the S&P 500 and our Compensation Peer Group, consisting of publicly
traded REITs with similar enterprise values and total assets, as further described in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Procedures
for Determining Compensation—Executive Compensation Decision-Making Process” and (ii) enable us to attract and retain individuals
of the highest quality to serve as our directors. In addition, the Board believes that a significant portion of non-employee director
compensation should align director interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, non-employee directors receive
a combination of cash and equity-based compensation for their services. Each of these components is described below. We also reimburse
each non-employee director for travel and other expenses associated with attending Board and committee meetings, director education programs
and other Board-related activities. Ms. Cafaro, the only member of the Board employed by us, does not receive compensation for her service
as a director. 2023 Proxy Statement 41 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD

    generally paid quarterly in advance. Pursuant to our Non-Employee Directors’ Cash Compensation Deferral Program (previously
    the Non-Employee Directors’ Deferred Stock Compensation Plan), non-employee directors may elect to defer receipt of
    all or a portion of their cash retainers and meeting fees. Deferred fees are credited to each participating director in the
    form of stock units, based on the fair market value of our common stock on the deferral date. (2) Effective January 1, 2023. (3) Each non-employee director receives $1,500
    for each Board meeting attended in excess of the eighth Board meeting held during the year; $1,500 for each Audit, Compensation
    or Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee meeting attended by committee members in excess of the sixth
    committee meeting held during the year, in each case, unless the meeting was 30 minutes or less. Prior to January 1, 2023,
    members of the Investment Committee also received $1,500 for each Investment Committee meeting attended during the year unless
    the meeting was 30 minutes or less. The per meeting fee was replaced with an annual retainer effective January 1, 2023. (4) Until 2023, annual awards of restricted
    stock or restricted stock units to our non-employee directors were typically granted on the date of the annual meeting and
    vested 50% on the subsequent annual meeting date and 50% on the next succeeding annual meeting date. In December 2022, the
    Board determined that, in line with prevailing practice, annual equity awards to non-employee directors will be in the form
    of restricted stock units and will vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant or, if earlier, the next annual meeting
    date. Directors may defer receipt of the underlying shares beyond the vesting date pursuant to the Non-Employee Directors’
    Equity Deferral Program adopted pursuant to the Ventas, Inc. 2022 Incentive Plan. 42 Table of Contents Corporate
Governance and Board Matters Review of
Non-Employee Director Compensation Our Compensation Committee is responsible for annually
reviewing the amount and types of compensation to be paid to our non-employee directors and recommending any changes to our non-employee
director compensation program for approval by our Board. As part of its annual review, the Compensation Committee may consider
(i) the director compensation levels of the Company’s peer group of companies and (ii) director compensation levels at competing
S&P 500 companies and other relevant compensation and benchmarking information contained in surveys compiled by Nareit, Spencer
Stuart or the National Association of Corporate Directors. The Compensation Committee did not recommend any changes
to director compensation for 2022. In October 2022, the Compensation Committee reviewed market data and received advice from Semler
Brossy, the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant, regarding appropriate levels of director compensation
for 2023. The Compensation Committee considered the materials presented by Semler Brossy and determined that, effective January
1, 2023, the per meeting fee for members of the Investment Committee should be replaced with a $15,000 annual retainer, consistent
with the compensation arrangements for other committees of our Board. The Compensation Committee also determined that future equity
awards to directors should be in the form of restricted stock units vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant or,
if earlier, the next annual meeting date. The Board of Directors approved these changes in December 2022. 2022 Non-Employee

Ownership Guidelines for Non-Employee Directors Our minimum stock ownership guidelines require each
non-employee director to maintain a minimum number of shares of our common stock with a value not less than five times the current
annual cash retainer (currently $110,000) paid to such director for service on our Board (excluding, among other things, any additional
retainer paid for service as a committee member or committee chair or the Lead Independent Director). Each non-employee director
must satisfy the minimum stock ownership levels within five years from the date that they first become subject to the guidelines
(or, upon any increase in the annual cash retainer, within five years from the date of such increase). Until a non-employee director
satisfies the minimum stock ownership guidelines, they must retain 100% of the shares of our common stock or stock units granted
to them as compensation. All of our non-employee directors are currently in compliance with these guidelines, after taking into
consideration the transition period for new directors. 44 Table of Contents Our Executive Officers Set forth below is certain biographical

Our Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation program achieves our objectives of retaining and motivating talented executives and rewarding superior performance while discouraging excessive risk-taking. The program supports a performance- and achievement-oriented environment that is geared toward delivering long-term stockholder value. Accordingly, our Board recommends that stockholders vote in favor of the following resolution: “RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure.” Although the results of the stockholder vote on this proposal are non-binding, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when making future executive compensation decisions. The Company currently provides an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on this topic every year; accordingly, the next opportunity to vote will occur in connection with the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting. Our Board recommends that you
vote FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. 2023 Proxy Statement 47 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION A
Letter from Our Compensation Committee Dear Fellow Stockholders, We would like to thank you for your continued
investment in Ventas. As members of the Compensation Committee, we are committed to ensuring that our executive compensation program
is tied to performance and aligns with the interests of our stockholders. We
Are Pleased with the Company’s Strong Performance in 2022 The executive team continued to advance
our strategic initiatives in 2022, delivering TSR outperformance and growth across all of our business segments. In the last two years,
the team has taken proactive steps to position the company to capitalize on the strong demographic demand that is expected to drive performance
across our diversified portfolio. As a result, we enter 2023 with strong momentum. We
Listened to Our Stockholders We thank all of you who met with us and
provided feedback on our executive compensation program and other topics before and following our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our Board of Directors has led our stockholder
outreach program for over a decade, engaging directly with our stockholders at least twice a year specifically on investment stewardship
priorities. These engagements have informed our approach to executive compensation, corporate governance, environmental, social and governance
(“ESG”) and diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”), among other programs. Before and after the 2022 Annual Meeting,
we and other independent members of the Board spoke with 30 different stockholders at least once, representing approximately 60% of our
outstanding shares and including all of our top 10 stockholders. We wanted to understand your perspectives on a range of topics, including
our 2021 executive compensation program, which did not receive majority support at our 2022 Annual Meeting. Most of the stockholders we met with expressed
overall support for our executive compensation program and enhancements we have made over the years. They also expressed appreciation
for our robust, regular stockholder engagement and demonstrated responsiveness to the provided feedback. Many stockholders shared that the design
of our annual incentive plan was a factor that informed their say-on-pay voting decisions last year, expressing a preference for a return
to a more formulaic, pre-pandemic design. Some shared concerns regarding the one-time service-based retention awards that were issued
in 2021—during the most uncertain period of the pandemic—to executives other than our CEO. Stockholders also expressed a
preference for more year-over-year consistency in the performance measures in our incentive programs and more detailed information about
DE&I metrics embedded in our long-term incentive program. We Responded to Our Stockholders’
Concerns These important conversations informed
several changes we made to the executive compensation program in direct response to your feedback. We modified our annual incentive
    program for 2023, returning to a design covering a full 12-month performance period, increasing the weighting for corporate performance
    measures to 75% (higher than pre-pandemic levels) and adopting corporate performance measures that are financial in nature and more
    consistent with prior years. We agree that special awards should be rare and will
    not grant special awards to executive officers absent compelling circumstances. We will also include a performance component in any
    special awards that we do grant unless it would defeat their purpose. We did not issue any special awards to executive officers in
    2022 and do not plan to issue any in 2023. Our 2023 long-term incentive plan contains performance
    measures that are identical to those adopted in 2022. We are providing greater disclosure in this Proxy Statement
    around the DE&I metrics incorporated into our long-term incentive program. We appreciated the wide range of views
represented among our stockholders and look forward to continuing our dialogue in the future. Sincerely, Roxanne

COMPENSATION Compensation
Discussion and Analysis This Compensation Discussion and Analysis
(“CD&A”) summarizes our executive compensation philosophy, objectives and programs, the compensation decisions made under
those programs and the factors considered by our Compensation Committee in making those decisions. Executive
Summary We
                           continued to deliver robust performance results in 2022. The Company delivered relative TSR that outperformed
                           the MSCI US REIT Index by approximately 16%, outperformed the Nareit Health Care Index by more than 13% and
                           placed the Company among the top 5 performing REITs in the S&P 500 for 2022. Total Company same-store
                           cash NOI* grew 6.1%, led by the strong performance of our SHOP portfolio, which delivered 13.4% same-store
                           cash NOI growth for 2022 and 19.1% year-over-year same-store growth for the fourth quarter. Normalized FFO*
                           grew 3.1% to $2.99 per share and Net Debt to EBITDA* improved by 0.2x over 2021. We finished the year with
                           liquidity of $2.4 billion. Our MOB business experienced its best financial year since inception. Our
    executive compensation program supports long-term value creation. More than 90% of our CEO compensation and more than 80% of
    the compensation for our other Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is variable and at risk, tied to our stock price performance or subject
    to achievement of pre-set rigorous performance targets that are important to stockholder value creation. Our
    2022 executive compensation program reflects several changes implemented in response to stockholder perspectives shared with us at
    the end of 2021, including the following: Reduced
    2022 target compensation for the CEO by 14% and for the CFO and former CIO by 8%; Moved
    closer to a pre-pandemic design for the 2022 annual incentive plan by increasing the weighting of corporate performance measures
    from 50% to 60%, and adopting corporate performance measures similar to those used pre-pandemic and using the same measures and weightings
    for the full year; In
    the 2022-2024 Performance Share Unit (“PSU”) awards, increased the weighting of the Nareit Health Care Index relative
    TSR measure to ~38% (from 25% for our CEO and 29% for our other NEOs). Our
    2022 annual incentive plan paid out at 110-148% of target in alignment with our strong financial results. These payouts reflected
    the strong performance on two measures that are important to our investors—FFO and Fixed Charge Coverage—as well as assessments
    of individual performance that ranged from 85 to 95 out of 100. PSUs
    earned for the 2020-2022 performance period were close to target value, consistent with our relative TSR performance. Performance
    for the period was between threshold and target for the relative TSR vs. MSCI U.S. REIT Index measure, between target and maximum
    for the TSR vs. FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index measure, at maximum performance on the R&I Pipeline measure and between
    threshold and target on our DE&I gender balance metric. Considering our stock price performance over the same period, the shares
    earned had a value at the end of the performance period of 83% - 97% of the target value. Our
    2023 incentive programs reflect affirmative steps undertaken by the Compensation Committee in response to the outcome of our 2022
    say-on-pay vote. During our Board-led stockholder outreach program in Fall 2022, members of our Board met with 21 different stockholders
    representing approximately 52% of our outstanding shares, including 9 of our top 10 stockholders. Stockholder feedback primarily
    focused on the rigor of the annual incentive plan followed by concerns regarding the issuance in 2021 of special long-term equity
    retention awards to executives other than our CEO in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Stockholders also expressed a preference
    for more year-over-year consistency in the performance measures in our incentive programs and more detailed information about DE&I
    metrics embedded in the long-term incentive plan. In response, we took the following actions for 2023: 2022

COMPENSATION Company
Overview Ventas Inc., an S&P 500 company, operates
at the intersection of two large and dynamic industries—healthcare and real estate. Fueled by powerful demographic demand from
growth in the aging population, Ventas owns a diversified portfolio of over 1,200 properties in the United States, Canada and the
United Kingdom. Ventas uses the power of its capital to unlock the value of healthcare real estate. We hold a highly diversified portfolio
through three reportable business segments—triple-net leased properties (“NNN”), senior housing operating properties
(“SHOP”) and office properties (“Office”)—located throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned or had investments in over 1,200 properties. For more than 20 years, Ventas has pursued
what we believe is a successful, enduring strategy built on diversification of property types, capital sources and partners, financial
strength and flexibility and strong ESG initiatives. Working with industry-leading tenants, operators and partners our collaborative
and experienced team is focused on leveraging our high-quality, diverse portfolio of properties unified by growing demand from an aging
demographic to produce consistent, growing cash flows and superior returns on a strong balance sheet for the benefit of our stockholders.
In 2022, we delivered Nareit Funds From Operations (“FFO”) of $2.82 per share and Normalized FFO of $2.99 per share. 2022
Performance In 2022, we delivered strong results across
our business segments and continued to advance our strategic growth objectives. Importantly, we saw the beginnings of what we believe
will be a multiyear growth and recovery cycle affecting our senior housing portfolio, which was significantly and disproportionately
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and represents nearly half of our Annualized Adjusted NOI. This multiyear growth and recovery cycle
is supported by: smart, well-timed actions we took in our senior housing portfolio throughout the pandemic; improving supply demand fundamentals in our senior housing markets, evidenced by the strong pricing power we saw in the portfolio
    throughout 2022 and into 2023; and a post-pandemic rebound that we expect to continue in 2023 and beyond. We are committed to igniting a new cycle
of success through differentiated performance and value creation for our stockholders. In furtherance of this goal, in 2022, our accomplishments
included: Despite significant market volatility in 2022, which impacted our absolute stock price, delivering relative
    Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) that outperformed all major benchmarks for the year. Notably for 2022 by: Outperforming the Nareit Health
    Care Index by more than 13% Outperforming the MSCI US REIT Index by approximately
    16% Performing among the top 5 REITs in the S&P 500
    for 2022 Delivering three-year compound annual TSR that outperformed
    the Nareit Health Care Index by 2.74% Achieving strong year-over-year
    financial performance, including: Normalized FFO* per share growth
    of 3.1% to $2.99 per share Total Company same-store cash NOI* growth of 6.1% SHOP same-store cash NOI* growth of 13.4%, including
    fourth quarter same-store cash NOI* growth of 19.1% Office and NNN same-store cash NOI* growth of 3.8%
    and 2.4%, respectively Launching Ventas OI™, our
    proprietary, industry-leading platform to drive performance in our SHOP portfolio. Ventas OI™ blends our operational expertise
    with advanced data analytics to engage operators and influence performance. Among other things, we conducted more than 70 Ventas
    OI™ sessions with operators and launched a web-based platform that visualizes over 200,000 new daily operating and sales
    data points impacting our business. Opportunistically extending our debt duration and committed
    capital at more attractive pricing by refinancing our existing $200 million term loan maturing in 2023 with a new $500 million
    term loan facility that matures in 2027. Receiving positive credit rating actions from three
    credit rating agencies, who attributed their actions to the sustained SHOP recovery that is underway, the durable cashflows from
    our diversified portfolio and our commitment to maintaining a strong financial position. Ending the year with robust liquidity of $2.4 billion.

with our experienced team’s insights and execution capabilities, we believe we are poised to drive unprecedented organic property
growth. 2022
Say-On-Pay Vote and Stockholder Engagement We have a longstanding practice of engaging
with our stockholders and taking actions that reflect perspectives and preferences that stockholders share with us through regular and
direct dialogue. Our Board has led our investor outreach program for over a decade, engaging directly with our stockholders at least
twice a year on executive compensation, corporate governance and other topics of interest to them. At our 2022 Annual Meeting, the advisory
say-on-pay proposal received 48.9% support of votes cast, including abstentions. The Compensation Committee and the full Board of Directors
took this vote outcome seriously, intensifying our robust, Board-led investor outreach effort to understand the full range of stockholder
perspectives that drove the decline in the say-on-pay support and to develop appropriate responsive actions. Fall
2022 Stockholder Outreach Following our 2022 Annual Meeting, consistent
with our Board’s long-standing practice of engaging with our stockholders each Fall, our Board invited our top 50 stockholders,
representing over 70% of our outstanding shares, as well as several additional smaller stockholders who had asked to be included, to
engage and share their perspectives with us. This outreach resulted in meetings with 21 stockholders over the course of Fall 2022, collectively
representing approximately 52% of our outstanding shares and including 9 of our top 10 stockholders. STOCKHOLDERS CONTACTED STOCKHOLDERS ENGAGED INDEPENDENT

COMPENSATION The meetings in the Fall of 2022 were
in addition to the stockholder engagement led by our Board in the Spring of 2022 during the weeks leading up to our 2022 Annual Meeting
and other, frequent engagement opportunities at investor conferences, stockholder calls and other periodic events, resulting in multiple
discussions with several of our stockholders throughout 2022. See “Corporate Governance and Board Matters—Stockholder Engagement”
for information regarding stockholder engagement more broadly, including our Board-led outreach program in the Spring of 2022. Ventas
Participants Our Fall 2022 stockholder outreach program
was led by the Chair of our Compensation Committee. At least one independent director attended each meeting, with at least two independent
directors attending the meetings with our largest stockholders. Participants in the engagement effort
were: Roxanne Martino, Chair of the Compensation Committee, who led the engagement effort; James D. Shelton, Lead Independent Director; Melody Barnes, Chair of the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee; Matthew Lustig, Chair of the Investment Committee; Walter Rakowich, Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee; Sean Nolan, member of the Compensation and Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committees; and Management representatives from our legal, investor relations and ESG teams. Key
Topics Discussed with Stockholders In the Fall 2022 engagement meetings,
we discussed a range of topics, including our executive compensation program, Board refreshment, corporate governance, corporate strategy,
financial performance and our DE&I initiatives and other ESG programs. We gained valuable perspectives from our stockholders,
which were conveyed to the full Board and relevant Committees of the Board and informed many meeting agenda items through the second
half of 2022 and early 2023. While stockholders had diverse and sometimes
opposing views on various aspects of our executive compensation program, a majority of stockholders we spoke with were generally
supportive of our approach to executive compensation and enhancements we implemented over the last few years, including in 2022, many
of which were adopted in response to stockholder feedback. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2022 Executive Compensation.” A majority of stockholders expressed concern
regarding the design of the 2021 annual incentive plan - in particular, the use of two half-year performance periods, the reliance on
strategic as opposed to quantitative corporate performance measures and the weighting of individual performance at 50%. As a result of
these elements, some stockholders viewed the 2021 annual incentive plan as being overly discretionary. Certain stockholders shared with us that
they appreciated the Compensation Committee’s effort to retain key employees during the COVID-19 pandemic—one of the most
challenging times for our industry—by establishing a special long-term equity retention program in 2021. Other stockholders expressed
concern regarding grants made under that program to executives other than our CEO and the lack of performance vesting conditions in the
design of those awards. Stockholders also expressed a preference
for more year-over-year consistency in the performance measures and weightings used in our incentive programs absent a compelling business
justification for taking a different approach. Many stockholders expressed strong support for our use of DE&I metrics in our long-term
incentive plan and asked for additional disclosure regarding those metrics. Below is a summary of the common themes
we heard during the engagement effort and the response of the Compensation Committee to the stockholder perspectives shared with us. 2023 Proxy Statement 53 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TOPIC STOCKHOLDER FEEDBACK OUR RESPONSIVE ACTIONS AND PERSPECTIVE Annual Incentive Plan Redesign A majority of stockholders expressed a preference for a more formulaic and quantitative annual incentive plan design, similar to our pre-pandemic approach, and requested more streamlined disclosure around factors considered by the Compensation Committee when determining final payouts. Response: For 2023, we: Returned
        to our pre-pandemic practice of establishing full-year goals for all performance measures Increased
        the weighting of the corporate performance measures to 75%, greater than the weighting in both our 2022 program (60%) and our pre-pandemic program design (65%) Simplified
        the corporate performance measures by reducing the number of measures from four to three—Normalized FFO/Share (45%), Fixed
        Charge Coverage (20%) and G&A Management and Expense Controls (10%)—all of which are quantitative and financial in nature Adopted
        corporate performance measures that are largely consistent with those used in our 2022 and pre-pandemic annual incentive plans Enhanced
        disclosures around the annual incentive plan design and determination of final payouts, beginning with this Proxy Statement Perspective: Given the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, we had changed the annual
        plan design for 2021 to place equal weight on corporate performance measures and individual performance and objectives. We set
        corporate performance measures for the first and second halves of 2021 to maintain the rigor of the incentive plan and incentivize
        desired performance outcomes during a period of significant uncertainty for our company and our industry. The corporate performance
        measures were comprised of key operational, strategic and financial priorities (rather than financial measures) that were designed
        to manage our business through a volatile period and position the Company for the pre-pandemic recovery. While we believe these actions served us well, they are no longer
        necessary and we moved closer to our pre-pandemic structure in 2022. For 2023, we have further enhanced our annual incentive plan
        structure by increasing the weighting of the corporate performance measures. We have reverted to our pre-pandemic practice of establishing
        full-year goals for all measures and adopting measures that are quantitative and financial in nature. We also have adopted corporate
        performance measures for 2023 that are largely consistent with those used in our 2022 and pre-pandemic plans. Consistent Use of Incentive Plan Measures Several stockholders sought greater consistency in the performance measures and weightings used in our annual and long-term incentive plans absent a compelling business justification for taking a different approach. Response: The
        performance measures and weightings for the 2022-2024 and 2023- 2025 PSU long-term incentive awards are the same The
        performance measures and weightings for our 2023 annual incentive plan have been modified as discussed above Perspective: We appreciate the desire for consistency in performance measures and
        weightings. As reflected in our timelines of incentive measures, the performance measures and weightings used in our 2022-2024
        and 2023- 2025 PSU awards are the same and are substantially similar to performance measures used in prior years for PSU awards.
        Similarly, the measures used in our 2023 annual incentive plan are largely consistent with those used in our 2022 and pre-pandemic
        annual plans. 54 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION TOPIC STOCKHOLDER FEEDBACK OUR RESPONSIVE ACTIONS AND PERSPECTIVE Special Awards to NEOs While several stockholders spoke favorably of our decision to issue long-term equity retention awards to employees, including our NEOs other than the CEO, in 2021, some raised concerns about lack of performance vesting requirements in the retention program design and others expressed a general view that special awards should rarely, if ever, be granted. Response: The
        Compensation Committee reaffirms that special awards should be rare, and that it will not grant any special awards to executive
        officers absent compelling circumstances The
        Compensation Committee also reaffirms that special awards, if granted in the future, will include a performance component unless
        the Committee determines that inclusion of a performance component would defeat the purpose of the special award, such as with
        any potential new hire incentives Perspective: Special awards approved in 2021 were designed to support the senior
        leadership team continuity that was essential for the Company’s success in navigating the significant impact of the pandemic
        on the Company’s business, given its focus on senior housing and healthcare, and on the industry more broadly. With the exception
        of “sign-on” awards to Ms. Roberts and Mr. Hutchens when they joined the Company in 2020, these were the first special
        awards the Committee had approved for any NEO since the Company redesigned its executive compensation program in 2017. The Committee
        did not grant special awards to any NEO in 2022 and does not contemplate any special awards in 2023. Disclosure of DE&I Metrics for the Long-Term Incentive Plan Stockholders expressed strong support for our use of DE&I metrics in our long-term incentive plan and asked for additional disclosure regarding those metrics. Response: Our
        disclosures in this Proxy Statement include expanded details related to the DE&I performance measure included in our 2020-2022
        PSU awards In
        addition, we have disclosed in this Proxy Statement the metrics that are being used to measure DE&I performance for our 2021-2023
        and 2022-2024 PSU awards Perspective: During our discussions with stockholders during 2022, a number of
        stockholders expressed strong support for our use of DE&I metrics in our long-term incentive plan, noting a preference for
        seeing longer-term DE&I metrics, a practice that remains rare among public companies. A number of our stockholders asked that
        we disclose the DE&I metrics used. While we generally do not disclose goals and other competitively sensitive information regarding
        our incentive compensation programs until the performance cycle is complete, in response to the comments received, we have disclosed
        the metrics that will be evaluated in determining whether our DE&I goals have been achieved (See – Compensation Discussion
        and Analysis—Executive Compensation Philosophy—Performance Measures and How They Are Linked to Our Strategy—DE&I
        Metrics” and “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2022 Executive Compensation—Long-Term Equity Compensation—PSU
        Awards”). Use of TSR-based Metrics Some stockholders expressed the view that we give too much weight to TSR-based metrics in the long-term equity incentive plan, while others expressed strong support for maintaining TSR-based metrics as the dominant metrics in the plan. Response: We
        have retained the TSR-based metrics in our long-term incentive plan. Perspective: As in prior years, we continue to see a division among our stockholders
        regarding the use of TSR-based metrics in our long-term incentive plan, with some stockholders of the view that we give these metrics
        too much weight, and a majority expressing strong support for maintaining these metrics as the dominant measures in our long-term
        plan. The Compensation Committee determined that the current use of relative TSR in the long-term incentive program was the best
        metric to support and incentivize performance and alignment with stockholders. The Committee will continue to consider appropriate
        performance metrics for the incentive program design in the future. 2023 Proxy Statement 55 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION We believe the actions we have taken during
2022 demonstrate the value we place on the perspective of our stockholders and our desire to ensure that our executive compensation
program is aligned with stockholder expectations. Executive Compensation
Philosophy We recognize that effective compensation strategies
are critical to recruiting, incentivizing and retaining key employees who contribute to our long-term success and thereby create
value for our stockholders. Accordingly, our compensation program is designed to achieve the following primary objectives: attract, retain and motivate talented executives; focus executives on accomplishing company and individual goals that support our strategic objectives; pay for performance that aligns with the creation of long-term stockholder value; provide balanced incentives that discourage excessive risk-taking; and support our goal to deliver sustained, superior returns to stockholders. We align the interests of our executive officers
and stockholders by maintaining a performance- and achievement-oriented program that provides executives with the opportunity to
earn market-competitive levels of cash and equity compensation for strong performance against key strategic, financial and operating
goals that create long-term stockholder value. In determining the design and scope of our
executive compensation program, we also consider the perspectives that our stockholders share with us, including through our proactive
Board-led stockholder outreach program and our annual say-on-pay advisory vote at our annual stockholders’ meetings. Certain
of our decisions regarding our 2022 and 2023 executive compensation program reflect that feedback, including the results of the
2022 say-on-pay vote. Our Compensation Structure Consistent with our compensation philosophy,
over 90% of our CEO’s pay and over 80% of the pay of our other Named Executive Officers is variable and at risk. Further,
a significant portion of our incentive pay is dependent on achieving pre-established performance measures. CEO TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION OTHER NEOs TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION The objectives of our program are as follows: Base Salary Base Salary compensates our executives for the knowledge, skill and expertise they bring to our Company on a day-to-day basis. Base salaries are generally targeted to approximate the median of the Compensation Peer Group, (1) but may deviate from this target based on an individual’s sustained performance, contributions, leadership, experience, expertise and scope of responsibilities within our Company as compared to the benchmark data. Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Annual Cash Incentive Compensation rewards our executives for achieving pre-determined corporate and individual goals established for the fiscal year. These goals typically represent milestones we have determined need to be met within a given year to advance our annual and long-term objectives. Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation rewards our executives for performance that supports our long-term strategy and growth. This compensation consists of (i) Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) that generally vest over three years and (ii) Performance Share Units (“PSUs”) that vest at the end of a three-year period, subject to achieving performance measures established at the beginning of that performance period. (1) The Compensation Peer Group are the companies we use to benchmark our Executive Compensation, as more fully discussed below. (2) Ranges shown above reflect variation in weightings among our Named Executive Officers. 56 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION Performance Measures and How They Are Linked
to Our Strategy Performance measures for our annual and long-term
incentive plans are designed to encourage our executives to focus on initiatives that will further the Company’s annual and
long-term strategic priorities and objectives. Annual measures typically relate to items that can be completed within one year
or are appropriately considered on a year-over-year basis, but we may also establish annual measures linked to longer term objectives
to emphasize the importance of a particular element of our strategy or incentivize completion of a preliminary step. Long-term
performance measures typically relate to items that are most appropriately assessed over a period of several years. The Compensation
Committee reviews the annual and long-term incentive program design annually. Set forth below are timelines that show the
evolution of the performance measures used in our annual and long-term incentive plans from 2018 through 2022, as well as the measures
approved in January for our 2023 annual plan and 2023-2025 PSU awards. The measures are designed to be complementary and to work
together holistically, as illustrated by the use of measures relating to the Company’s Research & Innovation (“R&I”)
Development initiative: In 2018, the Company identified
    R&I Development as an important component of its strategy. In 2019, the Committee included an R&I Development
    Growth measure in the annual incentive plan to focus the executive team on identifying and committing to appropriate R&I
    projects in the first full year of this initiative. In 2020, the Committee continued to employ a
    measure related to this initiative (Investment in Development) in the annual incentive plan to ensure opportunities identified
    in the prior year were aggressively pursued in the second year. The Committee also added an R&I Pipeline Openings measure
    to the long-term incentive plan to incentivize project completion and new facilities opening within anticipated time frames,
    which ensures that revenue from the projects is generated and contributes to financial performance on a timely basis. In 2021, the third full year of this initiative,
    the Committee removed the Investment in Development measure from the annual incentive plan, reflecting the maturity of the
    initiative, but retained the R&I Pipeline Openings measure in the long-term incentive plan to ensure that the initiated
    projects continued to be pursued and completed within anticipated time frames. In 2022, the Company removed the R&I Pipeline

our executives to take actions required in the short term to achieve our short- and long-term strategic priorities and objectives

For 2020-2022 performance period, there are slight variances in weighting between CEO and other NEOs due to rounding (e.g., the measure tied to DE&I metric was weighted at 9.9% for the CEO and 10% for the other NEOs). Use of DE&I
Metrics in our Long-Term Incentive Plan We have a long history of actively promoting
diversity, equity & inclusion in our company, our industry and our communities, which we believe supports the creation of long-term
stockholder value. As reflected above, we first introduced a
metric designed to measure our progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in our 2020-2022 PSU awards. For those
awards, the DE&I metric was tied to gender balance across the organization, which was a goal established under our corporate
sustainability report following completion of our GRI-aligned ESG materiality assessment. That assessment took into account the
views of key stakeholder groups, including our stockholders, business partners and employees. In 2020, to accelerate our efforts, we developed
a customized, comprehensive DE&I framework organized around the pillars of people, culture, investment and ‘Beyond Ventas.’
We formed a DE&I Committee headed by our Chairman & CEO to put our DE&I framework into action, engaging a diverse,
multi-disciplinary group of employees across our organization in the effort. To reinforce our seriousness of purpose, we incorporated
a broader set of DE&I metrics in our 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 PSU awards, which are designed to measure progress on our DE&I
initiatives. For the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 PSU awards,
progress on our DE&I initiatives will be assessed based on the following metrics, for which there are pre-set quantitative
targets: Minority/women-owned
    business spend for US ground-up construction and development projects Representation of women
    in senior leadership Diverse representation
    of interns 2023 Proxy Statement 59 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Average mean score on our
    annual DE&I employee survey Employee participation in Company-sponsored
    DE&I employee training, education and event hours Development of meaningful partnerships with
    Historically Black Colleges & Universities and similar organizations focused on advancing diversity, equity and inclusion
    in the commercial real estate industry These metrics were selected following review
by the Compensation Committee of our DE&I framework and underlying initiatives and identification of metrics that are either
foundational to making progress toward our DE&I goals or demonstrate that our DE&I initiatives are having the desired effect.
The Company expects to disclose the quantitative goals for each metric following completion of the applicable performance period. Procedures for Determining
Compensation Executive Compensation Decision-Making Process The Company is committed to a competitive
compensation structure that allows us to attract, retain and motivate our key executives while creating alignment with long-term
stockholder value. We review executive compensation regularly to ensure that our compensation programs align with this philosophy.
As part of this process, we engage in extensive benchmarking with the assistance of our independent compensation consultant, Semler
Brossy. We also maintain an ongoing dialogue with our stockholders to solicit their perspectives on our executive compensation
program. Each year, the Compensation Committee: Benchmarking and Compensation
Peer Group For benchmarking purposes, our independent
compensation consultant, Semler Brossy, provides our Compensation Committee with comparative market data on compensation practices
and programs of our peer companies (the “Compensation Peer Group”) and provides guidance on compensation trends and
best practices. Using this market data, Semler Brossy advises the Compensation Committee and makes recommendations with respect
to program design and setting base salaries and incentive award opportunity levels for our Named Executive Officers. 2022 Compensation Peer Group
Positioning The Compensation Committee reviews the Compensation
Peer Group each summer to ensure the Company is using an appropriate group for pay level and pay practice comparisons. The Compensation
Peer Group generally consists of large-cap REITs in our healthcare sector or large-cap REITS in other sectors (such as office,
retail and lodging) that are similar to us in other ways, such as total assets, revenue and enterprise value. The chart below shows
our positioning relative to our 2022 Compensation Peer Group as of June 15, 2021. 60 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE

(PEAK) Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY) In determining 2022 compensation targets for
our Named Executive Officers, our Compensation Committee, in consultation with Semler Brossy, considered the competitive positioning
of our executive compensation levels relative to compensation data for the 2022 Compensation Peer Group with respect to the following
pay components: base salary; total annual compensation opportunity (base salary plus annual incentive awards); long-term equity
incentives (annualized target value of long-term equity incentive awards) and total direct compensation (base salary plus annual
incentive awards and annualized target value of long-term equity incentive awards). This assessment included a review of awarded
pay; pay realized in recent years, projections regarding realized pay in future years and potential retention concerns. The Committee
also considered concerns expressed by our stockholders in discussions throughout 2021. Consistent with our compensation philosophy,
our Compensation Committee reviewed each element of pay in the context of the Compensation Peer Group. The Committee does not target
a specific percentile of market when making pay decisions, but rather determines overall total target direct compensation relative
to the Compensation Peer Group based on the unique skills, expertise and individual contributions of each Named Executive Officer.
Our 2022 executive compensation program was designed to deliver compensation levels at, above or below these targets if performance
met, exceeded or failed to achieve the goals established for the annual and long-term incentive awards. Compensation Policies and Practices—Good

changes, including those described below, some of which were implemented in response to stockholder perspectives shared with us
at the end of 2021. Reduced Target Compensation
for the CEO, CFO and CIO In 2021, with input from its independent consultant
Semler Brossy, the Compensation Committee initiated a thorough review of executive compensation that considered, among other factors,
stockholder perspectives. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the independent members of the Board
of Directors approved, with the affected executives’ agreement and support: a $2.0 million, or 14%, reduction in 2022 target compensation for Ms. Cafaro, effectuated through a
    19% reduction in her annual long-term incentive opportunity; and a $0.4 million, or 8%, reduction in regular 2022 annual target compensation for each of Mr. Probst and Mr. Cobb (then
    the Company’s CIO), effectuated through a 13% reduction in their annual long-term incentive opportunities. The Compensation Committee approved 7% merit increases
in base salary for Mr. Bulgarelli and Mr. Hutchens effective January 1, 2022. There were no other changes to the 2022 compensation
structure for the NEOs. Moved Closer to Pre-Pandemic
Design for our Annual Incentive Plan In response to stockholders who, at the end of 2021,
expressed a preference for a return to an annual incentive plan with a greater emphasis on quantitative corporate performance
measures and a limited discretionary component, the Compensation Committee increased the weighting of the corporate measures in
our 2022 annual incentive plan to 60% from the 50% weighting used in 2021 and adopted primarily quantitative, financial measures.
Due to continued market volatility and the uncertain business environment, the Committee elected to establish full-year corporate
performance measures and weightings, but to set goals for the first and second halves of the year rather than for the full year.
This allowed the Compensation Committee to review the Company’s performance and market conditions mid-year and establish
second half goals based on that information. Increased Allocation to
Relative TSR Metrics to Drive Long-Term Value Creation To strengthen alignment of our long-term incentive
plan design with stockholder experience and incentivize long-term value creation, we increased the weighting assigned to the relative
TSR measure vs. FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index to ~38% (from 25% for our CEO and 29% for our other NEOs) in the 2022-2024
PSU program design. With this change, the combined weighting of the two relative TSR measures in the long-term performance program
accounts for 63% of the total PSU opportunity, focusing the executive team on our competitiveness and long-term stockholder value
creation. Additionally, we removed the R&I Pipeline Openings
performance measure, as we anticipated the transition from a growth initiative to a sustainable business, and we expanded our
DE&I metrics from a narrow focus on gender balance to a set of broader metrics designed to measure progress on DE&I initiatives
overall. 2022 Base Salary Our Compensation Committee reviews the base salaries
of our executive officers annually to determine whether any adjustments are warranted. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the
Compensation Committee reviewed benchmarking data and a realized pay analysis provided by its independent compensation consultant,
Semler Brossy. Based on that review, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors approved merit increases of 7% in the
2022 base salaries of Mr. Bulgarelli and Mr. Hutchens in recognition of their sustained performance contributions and competitive
market conditions. Base salaries for Ms. Cafaro, Mr. Probst and Mr. Cobb were unchanged. The chart below shows the base salary approved by
the Compensation Committee for each of our Named Executive Officers for 2020, 2021 and 2022. Each of our executives agreed to
accept a temporary base salary reduction for the second half of 2020 when it became apparent that the COVID-19 pandemic was going
to have a significant negative impact on our business; the adjusted salaries are provided in note 1 to the chart below.

    Mr. Cobb, $606,759 and Mr. Hutchens, $470,000 (annualized). (2) The 2020 Base Salary shown for Mr. Hutchens, who joined the Company in March 2020, is provided on an annualized basis.
    The amount earned by Mr. Hutchens during 2020 is shown in the 2022 Summary Compensation Table. 62 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Annual Incentive Compensation We provide our executive officers with an annual opportunity
to earn cash incentive awards based on the achievement of pre-established corporate and individual performance measures. In establishing
the performance measures and goals, the Compensation Committee considers the Company’s strategic priorities and the specific
challenges and opportunities facing the Company at the time. Annual performance measures and goals are designed to incentivize our executive officers to address the near-term priorities that are necessary to implement our strategy without taking inappropriate
risk. The annual program typically measures performance
over the full fiscal year, and the Compensation Committee generally approves specific performance measures, goals and weightings
and an award opportunity range (expressed as multiples of base salary at each applicable level of performance) early in the year
for each executive officer. In 2022, due to continued market volatility and the
uncertain business environment, the Committee elected to establish full-year corporate measures and weightings, but to set goals
for the first and second halves of the year rather than for the full year. This allowed the Committee to review the Company’s
performance and market conditions mid-year and establish second half goals based on that information. Financial and individual
performance metrics were assigned 60% and 40% weighting respectively. 2022 Annual Incentive Award Opportunities The award opportunity under our annual incentive plan
is tied to each executive officer’s base salary in effect at the time of grant. The 2022 annual incentive award opportunity
for each of our Named Executive Officers is set forth in the table below; there were no increases, as a percentage of base salary,
from the 2021 annual incentive award opportunities. There is no payout for performance that falls below threshold and no increase
above the maximum payout for performance above maximum.

measures focused on financial measures tied to the long-term health of our business. 2022 Annual Incentive Performance Measures
and Results Corporate Performance Measures and Results 60% of Award The charts on the following pages set forth the corporate
performance measures and goals that were established for 2022, management’s progress against those goals and the level of
achievement that the Compensation Committee determined was reached. Because the range of potential payouts is broader for some
executives than for others, the level of achievement is scored on a 100-point scale, with achievement at target equal to 50. For
example, performance half-way between target and maximum would generate an achievement score of 75, and would result in a payout
equal to 140% of target for Ms. Cafaro and 117% of target for Mr. Bulgarelli. 2023 Proxy Statement 63 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 2022 Corporate Measures and Results* Achievement:

    of operating performance for REITs because it excludes, among other items, the effect of gains and losses from real estate
    sales and real estate depreciation and amortization, to allow investors, analysts and management to compare operating performance
    among companies and across time periods on a consistent basis. A REIT’s FFO can have a significant impact on the trading
    price of its common stock and, therefore, its TSR. Normalized FFO is the main measure the Company uses in its publicly reported
    earnings and is defined as FFO excluding certain items, such as non-cash income tax items and deal costs/expenses. Target
    performance for the second half of the year was set slightly below the first quarter target and actual result achieved due
    to increased headwinds caused by the macroeconomic environment, including labor and interest rate expense. Performance in line with or above Normalized FFO/Share Guidance Below in both quarters Meets in one quarter Meets in both quarters 100 Below in both quarters Meets in one quarter Meets in both quarters 100 100 Why this measure was chosen: This measure was included
    to accentuate for the executive team importance of meeting or exceeding quarterly guidance against the backdrop of anticipated
    continued market volatility and uncertainty. Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (1) 70 80 75 Why this measure was chosen: Fixed Charge Coverage ratio
    reflects the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt obligations and
    continue to pay or increase our dividend. A strong ratio of EBITDA-generation compared to fixed payment obligations—one
    element of our comprehensive risk management program—is especially important for REITs, which are dividend-paying and
    required to distribute to stockholders a substantial portion of their annual taxable net income. The target ratio for the
    second half of 2022 was lower than that for the first half because of increased headwinds caused by the macroeconomic environment,
    including labor and interest rate expense. Comparable SHOP NOI Growth (2) 55 55 55 Why this measure was chosen: The Company’s SHOP
    segment represents approximately 30% of Annualized Adjusted NOI and was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This
    measure was chosen to ensure that management continued to focus on performance in the SHOP segment, including executing on
    the “Right Market, Right Asset, Right Operator” initiative introduced in 2021. (1) Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio determined based on trailing twelve months, as reported, as of June 30,
    2022, for first half and December 31, 2022, for second half of year. (2) Comparable SHOP NOI Growth measured against the first half of 2021 for first half and the second half of 2021 for second
    half performance. * Certain of our financial performance measures are non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding non-GAAP performance
    measures, please see Appendix A. 64 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Individual Performance 40% of Award The individual performance component of our annual
incentive plan takes the form of tailored individual measures and objectives, which are typically finalized in March. The individual
measures and objectives for our Named Executive Officers for 2022 generally fell into the following categories: Financial and Operating Performance Strategic Projects and Initiatives Risk Management Organizational Strength, Culture & Values The Compensation Committee assessed performance of
each of our Named Executive Officers against the pre-established individual performance measures and objectives during meetings
throughout the year and following the completion of fiscal 2022. The Committee considered the following in assessing individual
performance: Financial and Operating Performance was outstanding, as we delivered relative TSR that outperformed
    the MSCI US REIT Index by 16%, outperformed the Nareit Health Care Index by more than 13% and placed the Company among the
    top 5 performing REITs in the S&P 500 for 2022. Normalized FFO/Share* grew 3.1% year-over-year and total company same-store
    cash NOI* grew 6.1%. Three credit rating agencies took positive actions regarding our credit, attributing their actions to
    the sustained SHOP recovery that is underway, the durable cashflows from our diversified portfolio and our commitment to maintaining
    a strong financial position. We managed our senior housing business for current outstanding performance, with same-store year-over-year
    growth of 13.4% and fourth quarter year-over-year growth of 19.1%. Our MOB business experienced its best financial year since
    inception. We made significant progress on our Strategic Projects and Initiatives, most notably by launching Ventas OI™, our
    proprietary, industry-leading platform to drive performance in our SHOP portfolio. Among other things, we conducted more than
    70 Ventas OI™ sessions with operators and launched a web-based platform that visualizes over 200,000 new daily operating
    and sales data points impacting our business. We Managed Risk by executing a $500 million 5-year term loan and approximately $1 billion in mortgages at more attractive
    rates in a rising interest rate environment, culminating in a debt profile with limited exposure to floating rate debt. We
    maintained a strong balance sheet by maintaining strong liquidity of $2.4 billion and reducing our overall debt exposure. We improved our Organizational Strength, Culture & Values through key investments in our organization and people,
    including leadership hires, development plans for key individuals, training, assessments, coaching, team-building activities
    and inclusive strategic planning activities. We bolstered our ESG leadership by committing to achieve net-zero operational
    carbon emissions by 2040, increased our spending with certified M/WBE suppliers, launched a successful pilot of water savings
    technology at 17 facilities and transitioned to LED lighting at 75 facilities. Based on this assessment, the Committee next considered
the contributions made by the Named Executive Officers in support of these achievements. Set forth below are summaries of key
achievements of our Named Executive Officers during 2022 that informed the Compensation Committee’s assessment of their
individual performance. As with the corporate metrics, achievement is scored on a 100-point scale, with performance at target
equal to 50 and performance at or above maximum equal to 100. * Certain of the financial measures discussed, including certain
    performance measures, are non-GAAP measures. Please see Appendix A for additional information and a reconciliation to the

As with our corporate measures, the Office measures were unchanged during the year, but had separate goals for the first and second halves of the year. The Office measures included goals relating to GAAP NOI, Same-Store Cash NOI Growth from Prior Year, Same-Store Expense Growth Over Prior Year, Same-Store Occupancy, and Health and Safety of On-Site Teams and Buildings.

the resulting calculated payouts for each Named Executive Officer based on the achievement described above for the corporate and
individual performance measures. Accordingly, in January 2023, our Compensation Committee and, for Ms. Cafaro, the Board of Directors,
approved 2022 annual incentive award payouts for our Named Executive Officers as shown in the table below.

portion of each executive officer’s compensation should be in the form of long-term equity incentive compensation. Our equity
compensation program has two components: PSUs that vest in three years based on performance achieved relative to approved performance
measures and RSUs that vest in three equal annual installments. These awards encourage management to create and sustain long-term
stockholder value because their value is directly attributable to changes in the price of our common stock over time. In addition,
equity awards promote management retention because their full value cannot be realized until vesting occurs, which generally requires
continued employment for multiple years. The chart below shows the percentage of our 2022 long-term
equity incentive compensation that is in the form of RSUs and the percentage of long-term equity incentive compensation attributable
to each measure that will be used to measure performance under the 2022-2024 PSU awards. Due to rounding attributable to the methodology
historically used to allocate shares to each PSU metric, there is a minor difference in the percentages allocated to the Balance
Sheet and TSR Relative to the FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index for the CEO and Other NEOs. 2022 LONG-TERM EQUITY PLAN DESIGN CEO 2022 PLAN DESIGN OTHER NEO 2022 PLAN DESIGN 2023 Proxy Statement 69 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 2022
Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation In the first quarter of 2022,
each of our Named Executive Officers was granted long-term equity awards delivered in the form of RSUs that vest ratably over
three years and PSUs that will be distributed in the first quarter of 2025 if performance goals for the 2022-2024 performance
period are achieved. Based on a comprehensive review
of our executive compensation in the second half of 2021, and views expressed by our stockholders during 2021 stockholder engagement
meetings, in January 2022, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors approved a 19% reduction in the long-term incentive
opportunity for Ms. Cafaro and 13% reductions for Mr. Probst and Mr. Cobb from 2021 levels. Threshold and maximum opportunities
for Ms. Cafaro, Mr. Probst and Mr. Cobb were proportionately reduced. The 2022 target opportunities, as a percentage of base salary,
were unchanged for Mr. Bulgarelli and Mr. Hutchens. The target values of the 2021
and 2022 long-term equity awards at the grant date were as follows: 2021 (1) 2022 Named Executive Officer Total Long-Term Equity Target Value (2) RSUs ($) Target PSUs ($) Total Long- Term Equity Target Value (2) RSUs ($) Target PSUs ($) Debra A.

    and, with respect to PSUs, assuming performance at Target. RSU
Awards Annual grants of RSU awards
are an important component of the Company’s executive compensation program. Through these awards, a percentage of each executive
officer’s pay is directly linked to our stock price. As a component of our 2022 long-term
equity compensation, in January 2022, the Company granted RSUs to each of our Named Executive Officers that vest in three equal
annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Vesting of these awards is generally subject to the Named
Executive Officer’s continued employment with the Company on each vesting date, as these awards are intended to enhance
retention of our Named Executive Officers. Dividends are paid on RSU awards as and when dividends are paid to all of our stockholders. The grants to each of our Named
Executive Officers during 2022 are set forth in the table below. Named

MEASURES AND GOALS PSUs may be earned, if at all,
based on the Company’s three-year performance from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024 in relation to four performance
measures. More than 60% of the 2022 PSU value for our Named Executive Officers is tied to rigorous relative TSR measures, while
the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio measure represents approximately 20% and our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measure represents 17%
of the 2022 PSU value for each of our Named Executive Officers. Performance CEO Weighting (% of total PSU Other NEO Weighting (% of total PSU Goals Measure opportunity) opportunity) Threshold Target Maximum Why we use this measure TSR Relative
    to the MSCI U.S. REIT Index (from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024) The MSCI U.S. REIT Index is comprised of small-, mid- and large- cap REITs across a diverse
    set of industries and therefore represents an appropriate index against which we should compare our long- term TSR performance. TSR Relative
    to the FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index (from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024) The FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index is comprised of all healthcare REITs. Because a significant
    portion of our business is in healthcare, this is an appropriate index against which we should compare our long-term TSR. Net Debt to EBITDA (1) ** ** ** Reported Net Debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA reflects the strength of our balance sheet
    and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt obligations. Measurable Improvement in Key
    DE&I Metrics (1) ** ** ** This measure serves to track our effectiveness in pursuing our DE&I initiatives, which
    we believe support the creation of long-term stockholder value. (1) Our Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion goals are confidential to us and
    competitively sensitive and therefore are not disclosed. Our Compensation
Committee sets goals for the long-term PSUs based on our strategy and long-term objectives. For our TSR measures, the Compensation
Committee established a band that provides a market-based spread of performance across potential performance scenarios in line
with our peer companies. Our Net Debt to EBITDA goal is set at a level designed to ensure that we have access to and a cost of
capital that allows us to be opportunistic and a margin of safety that protects our stockholders. Achievement on our measure related
to key DE&I metrics will be determined based on performance relative to goals established to measure numbers of women and
persons of color in certain groups of employees, employee satisfaction with DE&I efforts, engagement of minority and women
owned businesses to meet our supply and service needs and hours of training and events focused on DE&I. Our DE&I goals
were designed to measure progress on our DE&I initiatives. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive
Compensation Philosophy—Performance Measures and How They Are Linked to Our Strategy—DE&I Metrics.” There will be no payouts on
any measure for performance below threshold and payouts will not be increased for performance above maximum. 2023 Proxy Statement 71 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 2022-2024

performance measures and goals described above. Dividends will be accrued on PSU awards and will be paid if and only to the extent
PSUs are earned. These PSUs are intended to reward long-term performance, strengthen our pay for performance alignment with our
stockholders and enhance retention of our Named Executive Officers. 2020-2022
PSU PERFORMANCE & PAYOUTS In January 2023, our Compensation
Committee determined that performance exceeded maximum for one of the performance goals and exceeded threshold for the other three
performance goals established for the January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2022 performance period. As a result, payouts were slightly
over target for the 2020-2022 PSU awards. Set forth in the charts below are (i) the applicable goals for each measure, (ii) the
achievement with respect to each measure, (iii) the PSU opportunity associated with each measure and (iv) the total earned for
each of our Named Executive Officers. Certain of our financial performance measures are not calculated in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. For information regarding performance measure calculations, please see Appendix A.

focuses on the elements described above, with limited provision for perquisites. Our Named Executive Officers are generally eligible
to participate in the same benefit programs that we offer to other employees, which in 2022 included the following: health, dental and vision insurance (for which we paid 10% of the premium in 2022); short-term disability, long-term disability and life insurance coverage (at no cost to the employee); and participation in a 401(k) plan (to which we made matching contributions of up to 3.5% of the employee’s base salary, up to the 2022 limit permitted by the Internal Revenue Service). We believe
these benefits are competitive with overall market practices. In addition, we provide certain limited perquisites and other benefits
to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. The only benefits provided to our Named Executive Officers in 2022
that were not otherwise available to all employees consisted of legacy supplemental disability and life insurance coverage, including
reimbursement for taxes relating to that life insurance coverage for Ms. Cafaro, and an opportunity to receive an executive physical
medical examination paid for by the Company. See footnote 4 to the 2022 Summary Compensation Table for additional information. Our Compensation Committee periodically
reviews the perquisites and other personal benefits provided to each Named Executive Officer and has determined that they are
consistent with current market practice. Except for the eligibility to participate in, and our matching contributions to, the
401(k) plan, as described above, we do not provide our Named Executive Officers with any retirement benefits. 2023
Compensation Decisions In October 2022, with input
from Semler Brossy, the Compensation Committee initiated a thorough review of executive compensation that considered, among other
factors, changes in the roles of certain of the executive officers, benchmarking data and stockholder perspectives. In particular,
the Compensation Committee considered that Mr. Hutchens was appointed to the additional role of Chief Investment Officer on January
23, 2023, assuming those responsibilities from Mr. Cobb, who separated from the Company in February 2023. Based on these considerations: there were no changes to Ms. Cafaro’s base salary, annual incentive opportunity
    or long-term incentive opportunity base salaries for Mr. Probst and Mr. Bulgarelli were increased by 2% and 4% respectively reflecting the increased scope of his responsibilities, Mr. Hutchens’ base salary was
    increased by 8.9%, his target annual incentive was increased from 150% to 175% of his base salary and his target long-term
    incentive was increased from 350% to 414% of his base salary 75% of annual incentive awards will be based on achievement of three corporate measures: Normalized FFO/Share (45%), Fixed Charge Coverage (20%) and G&A Management and Expense Controls (10%) 2023 Proxy Statement 73 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 2023-2025 Performance Units will measure achievement against four measures: TSR relative to MSCI U.S. REIT Index (25%), TSR relative to Nareit Healthcare REIT Index (38%), Net Debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA (20%) and Measurable Improvement in Key DE&I Metrics (17%) The effect of these 2023 compensation decisions is outlined

amended and restated employment agreement with Ms. Cafaro on March 22, 2011 (the “Cafaro Agreement”). Pursuant to
the Cafaro Agreement, Ms. Cafaro is entitled to receive an annual base salary of not less than $915,000 and is eligible to participate
in our incentive and other employee benefit plans. The Cafaro Agreement also requires that we provide Ms. Cafaro with $2 million
of life insurance coverage and executive disability coverage that would provide annual benefits of at least 100% of her base salary.
The term of Ms. Cafaro’s employment will continue until terminated or the Cafaro Agreement is amended. Agreement with Peter J. Bulgarelli,
Executive Vice President, Office and President & CEO, Lillibridge Healthcare Services Inc. In connection with his employment
by the Company, Mr. Bulgarelli and the Company entered into a Letter Agreement dated March 20, 2018 (the “Bulgarelli Offer
Letter”). Under the terms of the Bulgarelli Offer Letter, Mr. Bulgarelli’s annual base salary was initially set at
$450,000. Mr. Bulgarelli is eligible to participate in the annual incentive plan with a target bonus opportunity of 150% of base
salary, 200% of base salary at maximum performance and 100% of base salary at threshold performance, and to participate in the
Company’s long-term incentive plans, with the opportunity to earn equity awards (a combination of performance share units
and restricted stock units) on an annual basis at 250% of base salary at target, 370% of base salary at maximum performance and
150% of base salary at threshold. Mr. Bulgarelli is eligible to
participate in the Company’s medical and other benefit plans pursuant to their terms. 74 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Agreement with J. Justin Hutchens,
Executive Vice President, Senior Housing and Chief Investment Officer In connection with his employment
by the Company, Mr. Hutchens and the Company entered into a Letter Agreement dated January 26, 2020 (the “Hutchens Offer
Letter”). Under the terms of the Hutchens Offer Letter, Mr. Hutchens’ annual base salary was initially set at $500,000.
Mr. Hutchens is eligible to participate in the Company’s annual incentive plan with a target bonus opportunity of 150% of
base salary and 200% of base salary at maximum performance and to participate in the Company’s long-term incentive plans,
with the opportunity to earn equity awards (a combination of performance share units and restricted stock units) on an annual
basis at 300% of base salary at target and 444% of base salary at maximum performance. Mr. Hutchens received a restricted stock
award having a grant date fair value of $3 million that vested in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries
of the grant date. Mr. Hutchens is eligible to
participate in the Company’s medical and other benefit plans pursuant to their terms. Because the Company required Mr. Hutchens
to relocate his principal residence to the Chicago metropolitan area, Mr. Hutchens also received a relocation package. Severance Arrangements The Cafaro Agreement and the
Employee Protection and Noncompetition Agreements (the “Executive Severance Agreements”) executed with each of our
other Named Executive Officers contain provisions regarding payments to be made in certain termination scenarios. These arrangements,
and the provisions in our equity award agreements regarding termination, are summarized in the Executive Compensation Tables of
this Proxy Statement, under the heading “Termination Provisions—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control.” Other
Policies Minimum Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers. Our minimum stock ownership guidelines
    require each executive officer to maintain a minimum equity investment in our Company based upon a multiple of their base
    salary, as set forth below. During 2021, our Company reviewed its minimum stock ownership guidelines against prevailing practice
    among REITs and the broader market for talent. Based on this review, we determined that our stock ownership guidelines are
    consistent with prevailing practice. Pursuant to our guidelines, each executive officer must achieve the minimum equity investment
    within five years from the date they first become subject to the guidelines and, until that time, must retain at least 60%
    of the after-tax shares of our common stock granted to the executive officer or purchased by the executive officer through
    the exercise of stock options. Each of our Named Executive Officers is in compliance with these Guidelines. The Minimum Ownership
    Guidelines for Executive Officers can be found in our Guidelines on Governance at https://ir.ventasreit.com/governance. Stock Ownership Requirement CEO 6X base salary All other Executive Officers 3X base salary Recoupment Policy. The Board has adopted a Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation
    that allows us to recapture amounts paid to our executive officers under certain circumstances. Under this policy, our Compensation
    Committee may require an executive officer to repay all or a portion of any excess cash or equity incentive compensation they
    received during the preceding three-year period if the incentive compensation was based on achieving certain financial results
    that were later required to be restated due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement. Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy. Our Securities Trading Policy prohibits our directors,
    executive officers and employees from engaging in derivative and other hedging transactions in our securities and prohibits
    our executive officers and directors from holding our securities in margin accounts or otherwise pledging our securities to
    secure loans. No executive officer or director engaged in hedging transactions, pledged or held our securities in margin accounts
    at any time during 2022. Tax Considerations. Section 162(m) of the Code generally places a limit of $1 million
    on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any year with respect to certain covered executive officers. Although
    we consider the impact of Section 162(m), as well as other tax and accounting consequences, when developing and implementing
    our executive compensation programs, our Compensation Committee retains flexibility to make compensation decisions that do
    not meet the requirements for tax deductibility when it considers it appropriate or necessary to do so. 2023 Proxy Statement 75 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with

    Company in the first quarter of 2020. In connection with his employment, he was guaranteed a payout of at least his target
    annual incentive award for 2020. The guaranteed amount is included in the Bonus column of the 2022 Summary Compensation Table
    and is the full amount that Mr. Hutchens received under the annual incentive plan in 2020. (2) Stock Awards: The amounts shown in the Stock Awards column reflect
    the grant date fair value of PSUs and RSUs granted in each applicable year (including, in the case of Mr. Hutchens, the Sign-On
    RSUs that he received in March 2020 when he joined the Company and, for Messrs. Probst, Bulgarelli, Cobb and Hutchens, one-time
    retention RSUs granted in January 2021), calculated pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 718 for financial reporting purposes. The grant
    date fair value of RSUs is determined by multiplying the number of units granted by the closing price of a share of company
    common stock on the date of grant. In calculating the grant date fair value of PSUs for financial reporting purposes, we use
    a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the grant date fair value of the TSR-driven components and the closing price on the
    date of grant, assuming performance at target—which was the probable outcome at the grant date—for other components.
    The Monte Carlo simulation “probability weights” potential outcomes of the relative TSR measures of each PSU award
    as of the grant date, based on, among other things, assumptions related to volatility, correlation and interest rates, which
    can fluctuate significantly year-over-year. As a result, the grant date fair value of our PSU Awards is higher in some years
    and lower in other years than the grant date face value at target, which is calculated using the closing stock price on the
    date of grant. 76 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The following table presents
the (i) grant date fair value of our stock awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 as outlined above (“Grant Date Fair
Value”) and (ii) grant date value of our stock awards (RSU and PSU awards) using our closing stock price on the date of
grant assuming (a) target level of performance is achieved for the PSU awards (“Target Grant Date Face Value”) and
(b) maximum level of performance is achieved for the PSU awards (“Max Grant Date Face Value”). 2021 data includes
the value of the supplemental retention awards to our NEOs other than our CEOs. For further information about these awards, see

    not granted stock options to any Named Executive Officer since 2017. All awards granted prior to August 17, 2015, are reported
    on a post-Spin-off basis in order to reflect the arithmetic adjustment made to outstanding awards as of August 17, 2015, the
    effective date of the Spin-off, to exclude the impact of the Spin-off. All outstanding option awards are fully vested and
    will expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. (2) Shares or Units That Have Not Vested as of fiscal year end consist
    of RSUs that vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Our Named Executive
    Officers are generally entitled to dividends paid on unvested RSUs. The vesting dates and number of shares vesting for each
    of our Named Executive Officers are as follows: Year Date Ms. Cafaro Mr. Probst Mr. Bulgarelli Mr. Cobb Mr. Hutchens 2023 January 25 25,047 17,584 25,002 12,540 January 29 23,388 February 1 16,470 6,831 4,834 6,819 4,827 February 24 13,917 6,490 3,706 6,478 March 4 22,324 2024 January 25 25,047 17,582 25,001 12,540 January 29 23,388 February 1 16,469 6,831 4,834 6,819 4,826 2025 February 1 16,469 6,830 4,833 6,818 4,826 (3) Equity Incentive Awards That Have Not
    Vested as of fiscal year end consist of estimated payouts for our 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 PSU Awards. These awards may
    be earned and vest, if at all, following completion of the applicable three-year performance period. Performance under our
    2021-2023 program was tracking between threshold and target and our 2022-2024 program was tracking between target and maximum
    at the end of the 2022 fiscal year. Accordingly, the amounts shown in the table reflect the number of shares that would be
    payable for achievement at target under our 2021-2023 PSU program and at maximum under our 2022-2024 PSU program. (4) The Market or Payout Value of Unearned Shares, Units
    or other Rights that Have Not Vested includes the following: (i) the market value of unvested RSUs and PSUs was determined by multiplying the number of shares/units
    by $45.05, the closing price of our common stock on December 30, 2022; (ii) the number of PSUs used to calculate the payout value assumes performance at target for our 2021-2023 PSU awards and at
    maximum for our 2022-2024 PSU awards; and (iii) the payout value of PSUs includes the value of dividend equivalent rights relating to those PSUs. Dividend equivalents
    are accrued and paid on our Named Executive Officers’ PSUs if and only to the extent PSUs are earned based on performance
    during the applicable performance period. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in Note 3, the value of the dividend equivalent
    rights reported below and included in the total PSU value in the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End Table reflects
    dividends that would have been earned as of fiscal year end assuming achievement at target for 2021-2023 and maximum for 2022-2024

    of RSU Awards in 2022 and shares delivered in 2023 pursuant to our 2020-2022 PSU Awards. Figures include any shares withheld
    to cover taxes on distribution of RSUs and PSUs on the distribution date; value realized is determined by multiplying the
    number of shares acquired by the closing stock price on the distribution date and adding to that the amount paid in respect
    of accrued dividend equivalents and interest. 2023 Proxy Statement 79 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Termination Provisions Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change

    payable pursuant to the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 PSU Awards. Amounts payable pursuant to the 2020-2022 PSU Awards, which were
    paid in February 2023, are not included because those awards are considered vested as of December 31, 2022. Because the 2021-2023
    and 2022-2024 awards were performing above target as of December 31, 2022, amounts payable assume performance based on actual
    results through December 31, 2022, in the scenarios where the award agreements provide for a payout at the higher of actual
    performance or target. Because the PSU awards convert to time-based awards upon a Change in Control and remain subject to
    the remaining vesting schedule in the event of a Change of Control in the absence of a Qualifying Termination (or subsequent
    retirement in the case of Ms. Cafaro only), we have not reported any PSU award values in the “Change in Control (without
    Termination)” column. (3) The value attributed to vesting of RSUs and PSUs is determined by multiplying the number of units by $45.05, the closing
    price of our common stock on December 30, 2022, the last business day of our 2022 fiscal year. (4) In the event of her Disability, Ms. Cafaro would receive continued medical and dental premiums for a period of 24 months.
    In the event of her involuntary termination without Cause or for Good Reason, Ms. Cafaro would receive continued health, dental,
    life, short-term disability and long-term disability insurance premiums for a period of 24 months. In the event of involuntary
    termination without Cause or for Good Reason for each of our other Named Executive Officers, the executive would receive continued
    health, dental and vision insurance premiums for a period of 12 months (24 months if such termination occurs within one year
    of a Change of Control). (5) Pursuant to the Cafaro Agreement and the Executive Severance Agreements with our other Named Executive Officers, under
    certain circumstances, payments or benefits are subject to reduction such that there will be no taxes imposed upon them by
    Section 4999 of the Code or any similar state or local tax. Determination of the reduction amount is based on a number of
    assumptions (including no value being assigned to restrictive covenants such as noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions),
    which may ultimately be different at the time of a Change of Control or Qualifying Termination, resulting in corresponding
    adjustments to the reduction amount. CEO Pay Ratio As required by SEC regulations, we are providing information
regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO. For
2022, the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than our CEO) was $121,329 and the annual
total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the 2022 Summary Compensation Table above, was $14,059,092. The ratio of our CEO’s
2022 annual total compensation to our median employee’s 2022 annual total compensation is 116 to 1. Our median employee
was determined as of December 31, 2022 by selecting the employee, out of all of our employees who were employed on such date,
with the median 2022 target total direct compensation (sum of base salary, target annual cash bonus and target equity award). The pay ratio presented in this Proxy Statement is a reasonable
estimate calculated in good faith, in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, based on our payroll and employment
records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the “median employee” and calculating the
pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply
certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay
ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio set forth above, as other companies may have different
employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating
their own pay ratios. 2023 Proxy Statement 83 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 2022 Pay vs. Performance Pay vs. Performance Table As required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank

    a shareholder would have recognized at the end of each of the fiscal years shown had they invested $100 in the Company or the FTSE
    Nareit Health Care Index, respectively, on January 1, 2000. We have chosen to include the FTSE NAREIT Equity Health Care Index TSR
    as our peer group TSR in this table as this is one of the primary measures of performance used in our long-term incentive plan. (4) Normalized FFO/Share is one of the primary measures used in our Annual Incentive Plan. Historical cost accounting for real estate
    assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, because real estate values
    historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real
    estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, we consider Funds From Operations
    attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance
    of an equity REIT. For information regarding the calculation of Normalized FFO, please see Appendix A. To calculate Normalized FFO
    on per share basis, Normalized FFO is divided by weighted average diluted shares, as set forth in Note 15 of our 2022 Form 10-K. 2023 Proxy Statement 85 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Relationship Between Compensation Actually

    3: Recommend, on an Advisory Basis, the Frequency with Which We Should Hold Future Advisory Votes Regarding the Compensation of Our
    Named Executive Officers We also are submitting to our stockholders a non-binding advisory vote as to the frequency with which we should hold an advisory
        vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. By voting on this proposal, stockholders may indicate whether they
        would prefer that we hold an advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers every one, two or three years.
        You may vote for any of the three options or abstain from voting on the matter. Our stockholders previously approved, and the
        Board adopted, an annual frequency for the non-binding advisory vote on our executive compensation. Our Board recommends that you vote for an advisory vote on executive compensation to occur every ONE year. In accordance with our desire to engage
with our stockholders and receive valuable feedback on a more frequent basis, the Board has determined that an advisory vote on executive
compensation that occurs every year continues to be the most appropriate alternative for our company. In formulating its recommendation,
the Board considered a number of factors, including the following: Holding an advisory vote on executive
    compensation will ensure that the Board is aware of, and can react appropriately to, positive or negative views regarding our executive
    compensation programs. An annual vote will provide more timely feedback on compensation decisions, allowing the Board to link the
    results of each advisory vote to specific compensation actions or decisions. An annual advisory vote is consistent with corporate
    governance principles that encourage regular engagement with stockholders. The Board considers frequent solicitation of our stockholders’
    views, including on matters of executive compensation, an important component of corporate governance. Based on information we have received from certain
    of our stockholders and public discussions generally, the Board believes that an annual advisory vote continues to be the frequency
    most preferred by our stockholders. Many of our compensation decisions, including salary
    adjustments and determination of annual cash incentive awards and long-term incentive awards, are made annually. An annual advisory
    vote aligns with the timing of these decisions and allows our stockholders a formal opportunity to express their view on each year’s
    compensation decisions. Although the results of the stockholder
vote on this proposal are non-binding, the Board values continuing and constructive feedback from our stockholders on compensation. Our
Board and its Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when determining the frequency of advisory votes
on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. Pursuant to SEC rules, if an alternative receives a majority of votes cast and we
adopt that frequency, we may exclude from future proxy statements any stockholder proposal asking that a different frequency be used. Following the 2023 Annual Meeting, we
expect to hold our next advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes at our annual meeting in 2029. 88 Table of Contents Audit
Matters Proposal
    4: Ratification     of Fiscal 2023 Auditor Selection Our Audit and Compliance Committee is responsible for the retention, compensation and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of its audit report on our consolidated financial statements and its audit of our internal control over financial reporting. As part of its regular processes, our Audit and Compliance Committee also annually reviews and approves the leadership and organization of the external audit team, periodically considers the rotation of the independent external audit firm and is directly involved, in conjunction with the mandated rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm’s lead audit partner, in the review and approval of our independent registered public accounting firm’s lead audit partner. Our Audit and Compliance Committee has selected KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. KPMG was first engaged to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm in July 2014, and each member of the Audit and Compliance Committee believes that the continued retention of KPMG to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for this fiscal year is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. At the 2023 Annual Meeting, we are asking you to ratify the selection of KPMG as our external audit firm for this year. We and the Board value our stockholders’ views on this matter, and we believe seeking stockholder ratification of KPMG’s selection is a matter of good corporate practice. If our stockholders fail to ratify this selection, it will be considered a recommendation to the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board to consider the selection of a different firm, and the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board may select another independent registered public accounting firm without resubmitting the matter to the stockholders. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit and Compliance Committee may, in its discretion, select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. We expect that representatives of KPMG will be present at the 2023 Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and have the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire. Our Board recommends that you
    vote FOR ratification of the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2023. 2023 Proxy Statement 89 Table of Contents AUDIT MATTERS Audit and Non-Audit Fees KPMG audited our financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2022 and has been our independent registered public accounting firm since July 2014. Fees billed for
professional services rendered by KPMG for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were as follows: Fees 2022 2021 Audit Fees (1) $ 3,670,900 $ 3,650,860 Audit-Related Fees (2) 17,430 2,450 Tax Fees — — All Other Fees (3) 100,000 — Total $ 3,788,330 $ 3,653,310 (1) Audit Fees include the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by KPMG
    for the audit of our annual consolidated and entity level financial statements (including debt covenant compliance letters), audit
    of internal control over financial reporting, review of interim financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,
    and statutory audits for subsidiaries, advice on audit and accounting matters that arose during, or as a result of, the audit or
    the review of interim financial statements and work on securities offerings and other filings with the SEC, including comfort letters,
    consents and comment letters. (2) Audit-Related Fees in 2022 and 2021 relate to consultations on accounting matters and the Company’s
    subscription to KPMG’s online accounting research tool. (3) All Other Fees in 2022 relate to tax compliance and other advisory services. All audit-related services, tax services
and other services provided by KPMG since the date of its engagement have been pre-approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee in
accordance with the Committee’s pre-approval policies described below. In addition, consistent with its charter and other applicable
rules and policies, the Audit and Compliance Committee determined that the provision of these services by KPMG did not compromise KPMG’s
independence and was consistent with its role as our independent registered public accounting firm. Policy on Pre-Approval of Audit
and Permissible Non-Audit Services The terms of our engagement of KPMG are
subject to the pre-approval of the Audit and Compliance Committee. Our Audit and Compliance Committee observes and implements certain
procedures relating to the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by KPMG to ensure that the provision
of such services and related fees does not impair the firm’s independence. In accordance with these procedures, the annual audit
services and related fees of KPMG are subject to approval by our Audit and Compliance Committee. Prior to its engagement, KPMG must provide
the Audit and Compliance Committee with an engagement letter outlining the scope of proposed audit services for that year and the related
fees. The Audit and Compliance Committee will then review and approve, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees resulting
from changes in audit scope, Company structure or other matters. In addition, our Audit and Compliance
Committee may grant pre-approval for those permissible non-audit services that it believes would not impair the independence of KPMG.
However, the Audit and Compliance Committee may not grant approval for any services categorized by the SEC as “Prohibited Non-Audit
Services.” Following review, the Audit and Compliance Committee pre-approves the non-audit services within each category that it
believes are reasonable and appropriate and that it concludes will not impair the firm’s independence, and the fees for each category
are budgeted. The term of any pre-approved non-audit service is 12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit and Compliance
Committee specifically provides for a different period. Fee levels for all non-audit services to be provided by KPMG are established
periodically by the Audit and Compliance Committee, and any proposed services exceeding those levels require separate pre-approval by
the Audit and Compliance Committee. To obtain approval of other permissible non-audit services, management must submit to the Audit and
Compliance Committee those non-audit services for which it recommends the Audit and Compliance Committee engage the independent registered
public accounting firm, and both management and KPMG must confirm to the Audit and Compliance Committee that each non-audit service for
which approval is requested is not a Prohibited Non-Audit Service. Our Chief Accounting Officer is responsible
for tracking all fees for pre-approved non-audit services provided by KPMG, and at each regularly scheduled Audit and Compliance Committee
meeting, management reports on the pre-approved non-audit services provided during the quarter and year-to-date and the fees incurred
for such services during such periods. All services provided by our independent
registered public accounting firm have been pre-approved in accordance with these procedures. The Audit and Compliance Committee has
determined that the services performed by KPMG and the related fees were consistent with the maintenance of KPMG’s independence. 90 Table of Contents AUDIT MATTERS Audit and Compliance Committee
Report A role of the Audit and Compliance Committee
is to assist the Board in its oversight of the quality and integrity of the Company’s financial reports. Management has primary
responsibility for our financial statements and the reporting process, including our system of internal controls, subject to oversight
by our Audit and Compliance Committee on behalf of our Board. KPMG is responsible for auditing the Company’s financial statements
and its internal control over financial reporting, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(the “PCAOB”) and expressing opinions as to the conformity of the financial statements with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities,
the Audit and Compliance Committee has reviewed and discussed with management our audited financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2022, including the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments
and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. Our Audit and Compliance Committee has
reviewed and discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB and the SEC. The Audit
and Compliance Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by applicable PCAOB rules regarding
the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit and Compliance Committee concerning independence.
In addition, our Audit and Compliance Committee has discussed with KPMG that firm’s independence from our Company and its management,
and the Audit and Compliance Committee has considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the firm’s independence. Our Audit and Compliance Committee has
discussed with KPMG the overall scope and plans for its audit. The Audit and Compliance Committee meets regularly with KPMG, with and
without management present, to discuss the results of its examination of our financial statements, its evaluations of our internal controls
and the overall quality of our financial reporting. In reliance on the reviews and discussions
referred to above, the Audit and Compliance Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for filing with the SEC. The Audit and Compliance Committee also selected
KPMG to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2023. AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE Walter C. Rakowich, Chair Michael J. Embler Marguerite M. Nader Maurice S. Smith 2023 Proxy Statement 91 Table of Contents Securities Ownership Stock

the meeting on May 16, 2023. Stockholders of record who wish to vote by proxy may submit their proxy in any of the following ways: By Telephone Call
    the number shown on the enclosed proxy card. By Mail Request,
    complete and return the proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. Via the Internet Visit
    the website shown on the enclosed proxy card. During the Meeting Attend
    the virtual meeting via live webcast at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VTR2023 and vote by ballot online. How to Vote—Beneficial Owners A stockholder who owns shares registered in the
name of a broker, bank or other custodian is a “beneficial owner” and can vote in advance of the meeting by following
the instructions provided by their broker, bank or custodian. Beneficial owners may also attend and vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting
using the control number on their voting instruction form. Eligibility Only Ventas stockholders of record at the close
of business on March 24, 2023, the record date, are entitled to vote at the 2023 Annual Meeting. As of the record date, approximately
400,053,497 shares of our common stock, par value $0.25 per share, were outstanding. Each share of our common stock entitles the
owner to one vote on each matter properly brought before the 2023 Annual Meeting. However, certain shares designated as “Excess
Shares” (generally any shares owned by a beneficial owner in excess of 9.0% of our outstanding common stock) or as “Special
Excess Shares” pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our “Charter”),
may not be voted by the beneficial or record owner of those shares and will be voted in accordance with Article IX of our Charter. Votes
by Proxy All shares that have been properly voted by proxy
and not revoked will be voted at the 2023 Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy. Shares represented
by proxy cards that are signed and returned but do not contain any voting instructions will be voted consistent with the Board’s
recommendations. Quorum The holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of our common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on March 24, 2023, which is the record date for our 2023
Annual Meeting, must be present in person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum to transact business at the 2023 Annual
Meeting. Stockholders who abstain from voting and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. A broker
non-vote occurs when a beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions to the beneficial owner’s broker or custodian
with respect to a proposal on which the broker or custodian does not have discretionary authority to vote. 2023 Proxy Statement 95 Table of Contents ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Other

vote on your behalf. A proxy statement is the document we must give you when we solicit your proxy. It is required by SEC rules.
By completing and returning the enclosed proxy card, you are giving each of the individuals designated as proxies in the proxy
card the authority to vote your shares in the manner you indicate on your proxy card. 96 Table of Contents ADDITIONAL INFORMATION What items will be voted on at the 2023 Annual
Meeting? Stockholders will vote on the following items
if each is properly presented at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Board
    Recommendation Page Reference Proposal 1: To

    4: To
    ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2023 fiscal year FOR 89 How do I revoke a vote? If you are a stockholder of record, you can revoke
your prior vote by proxy if you: 1. execute and return a later-dated proxy card
    before your proxy is voted at the 2023 Annual Meeting; 2. vote by telephone or over the internet; 3. deliver a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary
    at our principal executive offices located at 353 North Clark Street, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois 60654; or 4. vote in person at the 2023 Annual Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner, follow the instructions
provided by your broker, bank or custodian to revoke your vote prior to the meeting. What are broker non-votes? A broker non-vote occurs when a beneficial owner
does not provide voting instructions to the beneficial owner’s broker or custodian with respect to a “non-routine”
proposal, on which the broker or custodian does not have discretionary authority to vote. The ratification of the selection of
KPMG LLP as our independent public accounting firm for fiscal year 2023 (Proposal 4) is considered a “routine” matter;
brokers have discretionary authority to vote on that proposal. How are proxies solicited and what is the cost? We bear the cost of soliciting proxies by or on
behalf of our Board. We pay for the cost of proxy preparation and solicitation, including the reasonable charges and expenses
of brokerage firms, banks, trusts or nominees for forwarding proxy materials to street name holders. We have engaged Innisfree
to distribute and solicit proxies on our behalf, and we expect to pay Innisfree approximately $20,000 plus reimbursement of reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses for these services. We also will reimburse brokers and other custodians for their reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with distributing forms of proxies and proxy materials to beneficial owners of our common stock. What is householding? To eliminate duplicate mailings, conserve natural
resources and reduce our printing costs and postage fees, we engage in “householding,” which means that we will deliver
a single set of proxy materials (other than proxy cards, which will remain separate) to our stockholders who share the same address
and who have the same last name or consent in writing. If your household receives multiple copies of our proxy materials, you
may request to receive only one copy by contacting Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at 1-866-540-7095 or in writing at Householding
Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Similarly, if your household receives only one copy of our proxy materials, you
may request an additional copy by contacting Broadridge as indicated above. We will deliver the requested additional copy promptly
following our receipt of your request. 2023 Proxy Statement 97 Table of Contents ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Electronic Document Delivery to
Stockholders Stockholders of record and most beneficial owners
may elect to receive an e-mail that will contain electronic links to our Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement and 2022 Annual

documents. It will give you a direct electronic link to the proxy voting site. Active employees of the Company who hold common
stock in certain employee benefit plan accounts or are stockholders of record generally receive their proxy materials by electronic
delivery to their business e-mail accounts. We will mail to stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability containing instructions

Statements This Proxy Statement contains “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange
Act. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies,
anticipated results from operations and developments, goals and objectives and other matters that are not historical facts. Forward-looking
statements include, among other things, statements regarding our and our officers’ intent, belief or expectation as identified
by the use of words such as “assume,” “may,” “will,” “project,” “expect,”
believe,” “intend,” anticipate,” “seek,” “target,” “forecast,” “plan,”
“potential,” “estimate,” “could,” “would,” “should” and other comparable
and derivative terms or the negatives thereof. The forward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs as well
as on a number of assumptions concerning future events. You should not put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which are not a guarantee of performance and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual
events or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We do not undertake
a duty to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. Certain factors that
could prevent Ventas from achieving its stated goals include those made in the “Summary Risk Factors” section, “Risk
Factors” section and “Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and that are otherwise
described or updated from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. 98 Table of Contents Appendix A: Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation Non-GAAP Financial Measures This Proxy Statement includes certain financial performance measures
not defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). We consider these non-GAAP
financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial
measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this Proxy Statement. We believe such measures provide
investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with the performance
of other REITs. Our definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by
other REITs. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives
to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance
or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of our liquidity, nor
are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. Funds from Operations and Normalized Funds

    from continuing operations exists as the effect would be an antidilutive per share amount. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes
that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen
or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that
use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Nareit FFO and Normalized
FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation
of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results
of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally
considers Nareit FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains
and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate
and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based
on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), Nareit FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a
company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. The Company believes
that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating
performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to
account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In
some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO because it
allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results. Nareit Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders
(“Nareit FFO”) The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed
in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement
of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization,
and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling
interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Normalized FFO The Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following
income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction expenses and deal costs, including transaction, integration and
severance-related costs and expenses, and amortization of intangibles, in each case net of noncontrolling interests’ share
of these items and including Ventas’s share of these items from unconsolidated entities; (b) the impact of expenses related
to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses,
discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s
debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive
equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on the Company’s income statement
and non-cash charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (e) gains and losses for non-operational
foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate
dispositions and other items related to unconsolidated entities; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive
events; and (h) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein. A-2 Table of Contents Appendix
A: Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable
to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions.
Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined
in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating
activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative
of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding

because they allow investors, analysts and the Company’s management to assess its unlevered property-level operating results
and to compare its operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. A-4 Table of Contents APPENDIX A: NON-GAAP FINANCIAL
MEASURES RECONCILIATION NOI The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income,
property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses. Cash NOI The Company defines Cash NOI as NOI for its reportable business segments
(i.e., SHOP, Office and Triple-Net), determined on a Constant Currency basis, excluding the impact of, without duplication (i)
non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (ii) sold assets, assets held for sale, development
properties not yet operational and land parcels and (iii) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein.
In certain cases, results may be adjusted to reflect the receipt of cash payments, fees, and other consideration that is not fully
recognized as NOI in the period. Same-store The Company defines same-store as properties owned, consolidated and
operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company
may include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but
not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in the Company’s judgment such inclusion provides a more
meaningful presentation of its segment performance. Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped
properties in the Company’s SHOP reportable business segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for
the full period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement
of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed
or redeveloped properties in the office operations and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments will be included
in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. SHOP and triple-net
leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under
consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented. Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified
as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted
by materially disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a materially
disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for the office operations and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those
properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties
may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase NOI, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or
achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v)
for SHOP and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator
or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period. Constant Currency To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based
disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s
results are shown in actual reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based
on the average exchange rate for the current period. Non-GAAP Performance Measures We use Fixed Charge Coverage and Net Debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA
(also referenced as Net Debt to EBITDA) as performance measures. Fixed Charge Coverage is calculated in accordance with the definition
used in our revolving credit facility. Additional information regarding Net Debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA is as follows: 2023 Proxy Statement A-5 Table of Contents Appendix A: Non-GAAP
Financial Measures Reconciliation Net Debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 (Dollars
    in thousands USD; totals may not sum due to rounding; unaudited) Net loss attributable to common stockholders $ (47,447 ) Adjustments: Interest 467,557 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 581 Taxes (including tax amounts in general, administrative and professional fees) (11,863 ) Depreciation and amortization 1,197,798 Non-cash stock-based compensation expense 30,714 Transaction expenses and deal costs 51,577 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, adjusted for partners’ share of consolidated entity EBITDA (24,947 ) Loss from unconsolidated entities, adjusted for Ventas’s share of EBITDA from unconsolidated entities 47,873 Gain on real estate dispositions (7,780 ) Unrealized foreign currency loss 326 Change in fair value of financial instruments 23,615 Materially disruptive events, net 12,451 Allowance on loan investments and impairment of unconsolidated entities, net of noncontrolling interest 23,912 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,764,367 Adjustment for current period activity 9,869 Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA $ 1,774,236 Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA annualized $ 1,774,236 Total debt $ 12,296,780 Cash (122,564 ) Restricted cash pertaining to debt (25,958 ) Partners’ share of consolidated debt (279,013 ) Ventas’s share of unconsolidated debt 454,376 Net debt $ 12,323,621 Net Debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA 6.9x The Company believes that Net Debt, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA and Net
Debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA are useful to investors, analysts and Company management because they allow the comparison of
the Company’s credit strength between periods and to other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their
nature are not comparable from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment and valuation
allowances), excluding (a) gains or losses on extinguishment of debt; (b) noncontrolling interests’ share of adjusted
EBITDA; (c) transaction expenses and deal costs; (d) net gains or losses on real estate activity; (e) gains or losses on re-measurement
of equity interest upon acquisition; (f) changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (g) unrealized foreign currency gains
or losses; (h) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events; and (i) non-cash charges related to leases,
and including (x) Ventas’s share of adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities and (y) the impact of other items
set forth in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein. Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA considers the pro forma effect on Adjusted
EBITDA of transactions and events that were completed during the period, as if the transaction or event had been consummated at
the beginning of the relevant period and considers any other incremental items set forth in the Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA reconciliation
included herein. A-6 Table of Contents Helpful Resources Annual
