We are continuously improving our online and in-store experience and providing enhanced training for our associates. In addition, to ensure we are the product authority in home improvement, we strive to provide unique and comprehensive product offerings, continued innovation, and exceptional convenience and value. To execute our strategy, we have committed approximately $11 billion over a multi-year period to investments across our stores, associates, digital experience and supply chain. Shareholder Return Principles Our first priority for our use of cash is investing in our business, as reflected by our One Home Depot strategy. Our use of the remainder of our cash is guided by our shareholder return principles: • Dividend Principle: Target payout of approximately 55% of earnings per share (calculated on prior year earnings per share), with a goal of increasing the dividend every year • Return on Invested Capital Principle: Maintain high return on invested capital, benchmarking all uses of excess liquidity against value created for shareholders through share repurchases • Share Repurchase Principle: After meeting the needs of the business, use excess liquidity to repurchase shares, as long as it is value creating Key Financial Performance Metrics Set forth below are key financial performance metrics for the indicated fiscal years. * ROIC is defined as net operating profit after tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.  For a reconciliation of net operating profit after tax to net earnings, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, and our calculation of ROIC, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on page 24 of our 2018 Form 10-K. Table of Contents D EAR F ELLOW S HAREHOLDERS: Your Board and management team are committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders. This commitment is reflected in our core values, which provide the foundation for our business and reflect the culture that was built by our founders nearly 40 years ago. We would like to highlight for you some actions we took in fiscal 2018 to ensure we are optimizing our governance practices to support continued value creation over the long term. Strategic Engagement and Oversight. At our December 2017 Investor and Analyst Conference, we outlined our long-term plan to create the One Home Depot experience, including a multi-year investment of approximately $11 billion. The Board’s engagement with management to address both the short-term needs and long-term strategies necessary to meet our customers’ expectations in a rapidly evolving retail landscape helped to shape this plan and to continue to refine it as the Company began to execute on the plan in fiscal 2018 . Company strategy is discussed regularly at Board meetings, and directors annually participate in an in-depth strategy session with management. Through these strategy sessions we tap into the ideas, viewpoints and experiences of our diverse and highly-skilled board members. Director Refreshment and Recruiting. We have continued to focus on Board refreshment to align our Board’s strengths with the evolving retail landscape. New director Stephanie Linnartz, who serves as the Executive Vice President and Global Chief Commercial Officer for Marriott International, joined us in May 2018. She provides us with a significant source of expertise as we roll out the One Home Depot experience, given her critical role in developing the customer experience at Marriott. We also added Manuel Kadre, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MBB Auto Group, to our Board in October. His service on other boards and management expertise has further enhanced our Board’s financial, strategic, environmental and real estate experience. After 11 years of service, Armando Codina will be retiring from the Board at the end of his current term at the annual meeting in May. Mark Vadon has also decided to step down at the end of his current term in May after serving on our Board for six years. Both have been valued members of our Board, and we deeply appreciate their service to The Home Depot and our shareholders. Shareholder Engagement and Governance. The Board and management carefully analyzed the results of the voting at the 2018 annual meeting, and at the Board’s direction, the Company initiated an expanded environmental, social and governance engagement program with our institutional shareholders. After taking into account feedback from those engagements, combined with the Company’s commitment to governance best practices, the Board approved several changes. In late 2018, we enhanced our disclosure of our Company’s diversity, providing statistics on our website about the ethnic and gender diversity of our U.S. workforce. This disclosure will become part of our annual Responsibility Report going forward. In February 2019, we reduced the percentage of outstanding shares required to call a special meeting of shareholders from 25% to 15% and updated our executive compensation clawback policy to specifically include conduct that causes significant reputational harm to the Company. Underpinning all of these actions is a commitment to our shareholders, which is in turn embodied in the shareholder return principles that we have consistently outlined for our investor community. By following these principles, we were able to return value to our shareholders in fiscal 2018 through a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend and $10.0 billion in share repurchases. We hope you will be able to join us at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Thursday, May 23, 2019 . You will find information about the Meeting, including the matters to be voted on at the Meeting, in the enclosed Notice of Meeting and Proxy Statement. The Meeting will also include a report on the Company’s performance and operations and a question and answer session.

The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement iii Table of Contents COMPANY CULTURE: DOING THE RIGHT THING (see page 6 ) The Company’s culture is based on our servant leadership philosophy represented by the inverted pyramid, which puts primary importance on our customers and our associates by positioning them at the top, with senior management at the base in a support role. Our culture is brought to life through our core values, values that serve as the foundation of our business and the guiding principles behind the decisions we make every single day. We believe our culture helps set us apart and provides a distinct competitive advantage for The Home Depot. We empower our associates to deliver a superior customer experience, and we reward associates who provide excellent customer service and embody The Home Depot values. We routinely measure our culture and values through associate surveys and by using our values as a basis for our associate performance reviews. Our officers and other leaders also participate in programs designed to build and strengthen our culture and to help it support the organizational changes necessary to create the One Home Depot experience. The Board and its committees provide oversight and guidance to support the continued focus on and importance of culture to our Company. FISCAL 2018 COMPANY PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (see page 33 ) Strong execution of our strategic initiatives resulted in solid performance in Fiscal 2018 . Highlights include: • Increased net sales by 7.2% to $108.2 billion • Increased operating income by 5.8% to $15.5 billion • Increased net earnings by 28.9% to $11.1 billion and diluted earnings per share by 33.5% to $9.73 • Generated $13.0 billion in operating cash flow • Returned value to shareholders during Fiscal 2018 through $4.7 billion in dividends and $10.0 billion in share repurchases • Increased ROIC from 34.2% to 44.8% .

LDCC = Leadership Development and Compensation Committee NCGC = Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee vi The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents C ORPORATE G OVERNANCE The Company has a long-standing commitment to strong corporate governance. Strong corporate governance promotes the long-term interests of shareholders, strengthens Board and management accountability, and helps build public trust in the Company. The Board has adopted policies and processes that foster effective Board oversight of critical matters such as strategy, risk management, financial and other controls, compliance, culture and management succession planning. The Board reviews our major governance documents, policies and processes regularly in the context of current corporate governance trends, regulatory changes and recognized best practices. The following sections provide an overview of our corporate governance structure, policies and processes, including key aspects of our Board operations. BOARD OF DIRECTORS Our Board currently has 14 members: Gerard J. Arpey, Ari Bousbib, Jeffery H. Boyd, Gregory D. Brenneman, J. Frank Brown, Albert P. Carey, Armando Codina, Helena B. Foulkes, Linda R. Gooden, Wayne M. Hewett, Manuel Kadre, Stephanie C. Linnartz, Craig A. Menear and Mark Vadon. Each director who served during Fiscal 2018 was, and each current director continues to be, independent other than Mr. Menear, our Chairman, CEO and President. Because Mr. Codina reached age 72 (our mandatory retirement age) in 2018, he is not standing for re-election and will be retiring from the Board when his current term expires at the Meeting. In addition, Mr. Vadon is stepping down from the Board at the end of his current term at the Meeting. Following the Meeting, the size of the Board will therefore be reduced to 12 members. BOARD LEADERSHIP We believe that having a combined Chairman, CEO and President, an independent Lead Director, and Board committees composed entirely of independent directors currently provides the best Board leadership structure for the Company. This structure, together with our other robust corporate governance practices, provides strong independent oversight of management while ensuring clear strategic alignment throughout the Company. Specifically, Mr. Menear, with input from our Lead Director, proposes strategic priorities to the Board, communicates the Board’s guidance to management, and is ultimately responsible for implementing the Company’s key strategic initiatives. At the same time, the Company recognizes the importance of providing independent oversight of the Board. Accordingly, since 1998, the Company has had a Lead Director. Our Lead Director is an independent director elected annually by the independent members of the Board. Gregory D. Brenneman currently serves as our Lead Director. Our Lead Director: • Chairs Board meetings when the Chairman is not present, including presiding at executive sessions of the Board (without management present) at every regularly scheduled Board meeting; • Works with management to determine the information and materials provided to Board members; • Approves Board meeting agendas, schedules and other information provided to the Board; • Consults regularly with the Chairman on other matters that are pertinent to the Board and the Company; • Has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors; • Is available for communication and consultation with major shareholders upon request; • Serves as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors; and • Conducts annual interviews of each independent director as part of the annual evaluation process. To maximize the effectiveness of the Lead Director role, our Lead Director does not serve on any standing Board committees but is available to attend meetings of any of our Board committees and serve as a resource for the committees as needed. COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS During Fiscal 2018 , the Board had standing Audit, Nominating and Corporate Governance, Leadership Development and Compensation, and Finance Committees. The charters for each of the committees are available on the Company’s Investor Relations website at http://ir.homedepot.com under “Corporate Governance > Committee Members & Charters.” The current members of our committees, the principal functions of each The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 1 Table of Contents committee and the number of meetings held in Fiscal 2018 are shown below.

The number of times that each standing committee of the Board met in Fiscal 2018 is shown in the previous section. Each director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the committees of which he or she was a member during Fiscal 2018 , except Ms. Foulkes. Ms. Foulkes attended 73.3% of the meetings of the Board and the committees of which she was a member during Fiscal 2018 . She missed only the Board and committee meetings that occurred during the same week that she was appointed as the chief executive officer of Hudson’s Bay Company and was transitioning to her new company. She attended all other meetings of the Board and her committees during Fiscal 2018 . Company policy provides that all directors are expected to attend annual shareholder meetings, absent extraordinary circumstances. Every director serving on our Board at the time of the 2018 annual meeting attended that meeting except for Karen Katen, whose service on the Board ended at that meeting. BOARD ROLE IN STRATEGIC PLANNING The Company’s strategy is rooted in enhancing our interconnected retail experience to better meet our customers’ changing needs and expectations. Our Board plays an important role in the continued evolution of the Company’s strategic planning process. At a dedicated strategy session each fall and through regular discussions at each quarterly Board meeting, our Board reviews the Company’s strategy and capabilities and actively engages with management to ensure that the Company is well-positioned to continue creating shareholder value. In Fiscal 2018 , those discussions helped to refine our long-term strategy of investing in the One Home Depot experience. As discussed in “Election of Directors” beginning on page 12, each director nominee possesses specific skills and qualifications that provide the Company with key insights into elements necessary to build our One Home Depot experience. As a result of our focus on Board composition, we believe we have a Board with an appropriate mix of skills, backgrounds and experiences that leverages its cognitive diversity to effectively oversee our strategy as the Company positions itself to remain agile in a dynamic retail environment. BOARD OVERSIGHT OF RISK The Board’s oversight of risk is accomplished through the identification of key risks facing the Company and the mapping of those risks to the appropriate Board committee and/or to the full Board, based on the nature of the risk. Our enterprise risk framework used to identify and manage those key risks considers a number of enterprise-level risks, including competitive environment, brand and reputation, regulatory and compliance, and security, as well as external and internal factors that could distract the Company from our business or derail our strategic objectives. The Board reviews these key risks and the related framework annually, and the Board or appropriate Board committees discuss selected risks in more detail throughout the year. The table below identifies key risk areas overseen by the Board and its committees. Key Areas of Risk Oversight Full Board • Has primary responsibility for risk oversight, including approval of strategic objectives and defining risk appetite • Delegates oversight of management of certain risks to Board committees • Receives regular reports from the committees regarding risk-related matters Audit Finance LDC Committee NCG Committee • Overall risk assessment and management • Long-range strategic planning • Senior executive compensation • Corporate governance • Financial exposures, statements, controls, systems, and reporting • Long-range financial outlook and finance-related risks • Senior executive succession planning • Director succession planning and board composition • Regulatory and compliance, including FCPA/anti-bribery and our whistleblower program • Capital structure, including investments and shareholder return principles • Overall risk related to the Company’s compensation policies and practices • Political spending and payments to trade associations • Data protection and cybersecurity • Annual capital plan and key capital investments • Human capital management • Environmental and social initiatives • Internal audit and related investigatory matters • Merger and acquisition strategy • Non-employee director compensation • Related party transactions • Quality, safety and responsible sourcing As part of our risk assessment process, the Board and each committee receive presentations throughout the year from management regarding specific potential risks and trends as necessary. At each Board meeting, our Chairman, CEO and President has the opportunity to discuss in a directors-only session matters of particular importance or concern, including any significant, evolving or nascent risks that may be of concern to the Board or the Company, and our Lead Director presides over an executive session of our independent directors at which risks faced by the Company may be discussed. Additionally, during Board-level review of the Company’s short- and long-term strategies, as discussed in more detail above, the Board considers significant risks facing the Company, as well as emerging risks and current trends, and their potential impact. We believe that the practices described above and our current leadership structure facilitate effective Board oversight of our significant risks. Certain of the risk areas identified in the table above are discussed in more detail below. Enterprise Risk Management In accordance with NYSE requirements and our Audit Committee charter, our Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing risk assessment and management, including the Company’s major financial 4 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents exposures and compliance risks and the steps management has taken to monitor and control those exposures and risks. The Audit Committee stays apprised of significant actual and potential risks faced by the Company in part through review of quarterly reports from our Enterprise Risk Council, or ERC. Our ERC is composed of leaders from the principal functional areas of the Company and meets at least quarterly to discuss key risks and mitigation activities. The quarterly ERC reports identify the Company’s top risks and denote whether primary oversight of each risk resides with a particular Board committee or the full Board. The chair of the ERC, who is also our Vice President of Internal Audit and Corporate Compliance, reports the ERC’s risk analyses to senior management regularly, attends each quarterly Audit Committee meeting, and leads the Board’s annual review of our risk framework. Data Protection and Cybersecurity The Audit Committee also has primary responsibility for overseeing risks related to data protection and cybersecurity, although the full Board also exercises oversight over these risks. This oversight includes detailed reports to the Audit Committee and/or the full Board on data protection and cybersecurity matters from senior members of our IT department, including our Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer. The topics covered by these reports include risk identification and management strategies, consumer data protection, the Company’s ongoing risk mitigation activities, results of third party assessments and testing, updates on annual associate training and other specific training initiatives, and cybersecurity strategy and governance structure. In addition, our internal audit department routinely performs audits on various aspects of data protection and cybersecurity and reports the results of these audits in its quarterly internal audit report to the Audit Committee. The chair of the ERC also chairs our Data Security and Privacy Governance Committee, which is composed of leaders from the functional areas of the Company. The Data Security and Privacy Governance Committee was created to provide enterprise-wide oversight and governance over data protection and cybersecurity, including oversight of related risks, mitigation and incident response plans, awareness and training programs, and regulatory compliance. Its activities are reported to the Audit Committee and/or full Board in the detailed reports referred to above. FCPA and Anti-Bribery The Audit Committee is also responsible for oversight of risks relating to bribery, corruption and FCPA compliance, in part through quarterly reports from our FCPA Oversight Committee, which oversees enterprise-wide compliance with the FCPA and the anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. The FCPA Oversight Committee is composed of our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, who chairs the committee, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President – Corporate Services, our Vice President of Internal Audit and Corporate Compliance, and representatives from each non-U.S. division, the business functions responsible for administration of our policies, and the business functions that manage our transactions outside of the U.S. Environmental, Social and Governance We believe that attention to material ESG matters is a foundational element of how we run our business and aligns closely with our corporate values. Because it encompasses such a broad area, ESG oversight is divided among several committees and the full Board. • The LDC Committee oversees risks related to human capital management, including matters relating to associate compensation and benefits, associate engagement and training, and diversity and inclusion. The LDC Committee was directly engaged in overseeing the disclosure of additional workforce diversity statistics in late 2018. • The Audit Committee oversees our responsible sourcing program and related supply chain risks. • The NCG Committee has primary responsibility for oversight of ESG matters generally. This oversight includes reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding our environmental, social and governance practices as well as corporate political activity and payments to trade associations. The NCG Committee receives regular reports on ESG engagements with shareholders and related investor feedback, as well as information on recent developments with respect to ESG matters. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 5 • Each year, the full Board receives a report on our sustainability strategy and activities, including a discussion of our ESG communications and our annual Responsibility Report. Our annual Responsibility Report describes our progress and initiatives regarding corporate social responsibility and sustainability, and is available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility. In Fiscal 2018, in response to feedback from investors and other stakeholders, the Company formed an ESG Communication Task Force focused on identifying key ESG-related issues of concern to our stakeholders and developing strategies to better communicate the Company’s current ESG efforts. As a result of those efforts, the Company created a dedicated web page to provide access to information about the Company’s ESG efforts, which can be found at http://ir.homedepot.com/esg-investors. COMPANY CULTURE: DOING THE RIGHT THING The Home Depot has a strong commitment to ethics and integrity, and we are a values- and culture-centric business. Our values are present in the way we do business and are more formally codified in the Company’s Business Code of Conduct and Ethics. These values and our culture are also reflected in our 2018 Responsibility Report, which can be found on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility. Inverted Pyramid and Values Wheel The Company’s culture is based on our servant leadership philosophy represented by the inverted pyramid, which puts primary importance on our customers and our associates by positioning them at the top, with senior management at the base in a support role. We bring our culture to life through our core values, values that serve as the foundation of our business and the guiding principles behind the decisions we make every single day. We believe our culture helps set us apart and provides a distinct competitive advantage for The Home Depot. We empower our associates to deliver a superior customer experience, and we reward associates who provide excellent customer service and embody The Home Depot values. We routinely measure our culture and values through associate surveys, which are done on an annual or more frequent basis, and by using our values as a basis for our associate performance reviews. Our officers and other leaders also participate in programs designed to build and strengthen our culture and to help it support the organizational changes necessary to create the One Home Depot experience. These programs include training on leadership skills, cross-functional collaboration, inclusiveness, sexual harassment prevention, unconscious bias, and associate engagement. The Board and its committees provide oversight and guidance to support the continued focus on and importance of culture to our Company. Business Code of Conduct and Ethics The Company has a Business Code of Conduct and Ethics that is applicable to all directors, officers and associates of the Company, including the CEO and the CFO. The Business Code of Conduct and Ethics reflects our strong commitment to ethics and integrity, and provides guidance on making decisions that align with our core values. The complete text of the code is available on the Company’s Investor Relations website at http://ir.homedepot.com 6 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents under “Corporate Governance > Overview” and is also available in print at no charge upon request. The Company will post any amendments to or waivers from the Business Code of Conduct and Ethics (to the extent applicable to the Company’s executive officers and directors) at this location on its website. SHAREHOLDER OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT We approach shareholder engagement as an integrated, year-round process involving senior management, our investor relations team and our corporate governance team. As discussed in the Proxy Statement Summary, in 2018 we enhanced our shareholder engagement process, with a specific focus on ESG matters, including the matters raised by the shareholder proposals on the ballot at our 2018 annual meeting. In the past year, we have engaged with holders representing over 40% of our outstanding shares to discuss these matters. The Board values our shareholders’ perspectives, and feedback from our shareholders on our business, corporate governance, executive compensation and sustainability practices have been important considerations for Board discussions throughout the year. The feedback we received from our recent engagements influenced several changes, including: • Providing enhanced diversity disclosure on our website showing statistics reflecting the ethnic and gender diversity of our U.S. workforce. • Amending our By-Laws to reduce the percentage of outstanding shares required to call a special meeting of shareholders from 25% to 15%. • Updating our executive compensation clawback policy to specifically include conduct that causes significant reputational harm to the Company. • Updating our Investor Relations website to provide a page dedicated to disclosure of ESG matters to better enable our investors to access key information about oversight and management of these areas We are planning to continue this enhanced program of ESG engagement going forward. GOVERNANCE BEST PRACTICES Our Board believes that effective governance means regular and thoughtful evaluation of the Company’s governance policies and processes in light of the broader governance landscape. As a result, our governance framework contains a variety of methods for shareholder engagement, as well as mechanisms to ensure effective Board operations. Shareholder Rights Our shareholders have the following important rights: • Right to call a special meeting of shareholders. Following our expanded ESG shareholder engagement program in 2018, we amended our By-Laws in early 2019 to reduce the threshold for calling a special meeting to holders of 15% or more of our common stock, from the prior 25%. • Right to act by majority written consent in lieu of a meeting. • A “proxy access” right. This right permits a shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least 3% of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the Board, provided that the shareholders and the nominees satisfy the requirements specified in the Company’s By-Laws. In addition, as described in more detail on page 10, shareholders may recommend Board candidates for consideration by our NCG Committee. Corporate Governance Guidelines The Company maintains Corporate Governance Guidelines that establish a common set of expectations to assist the Board and its committees in performing their duties. The table below provides an overview of several key elements of our Guidelines, which are available on the Company’s Investor Relations website at http://ir.homedepot.com under “Corporate Governance > Overview” and in print at no charge upon request. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 7 Table of Contents Key Corporate Governance Guidelines Provisions Outside Board Policy We limit the number of other public company boards our directors may join to ensure that a director is not “overboarded” and is able to devote the appropriate amount of time and attention to the oversight of the Company. A director who is in an active, full-time role with a for-profit business may not serve on more than three other public company boards. Other directors may not serve on more than four other public company boards. In addition, Mr. Menear, our Chairman, CEO and President, may not serve on more than one other public company board. Any director seeking to join the board of directors of another public company or for-profit organization must first notify the NCG Committee and obtain its approval to continue as a member of our Board. Succession Planning A key responsibility of the Board is overseeing the identification and development of senior leadership. Both the Board and LDC Committee are actively engaged in succession planning. The LDC Committee oversees the development and implementation of succession plans for senior leadership positions. This process includes review and discussion of the performance and development of senior leadership on a regular basis, along with management’s evaluation and recommendations for senior leadership succession. The Board also annually reviews succession plans for senior management and the CEO, including both a long-term succession plan and an emergency succession plan. To assist the Board, our CEO annually provides his assessment of senior leaders and their potential to succeed at key senior management positions. The Board meets potential leaders at many levels across the organization through formal presentations and informal events throughout the year, including through the store walks and management meetings that are part of our director engagement program. Director Engagement, Education and Orientation Program The NCG Committee oversees the director engagement, continuing education and orientation program, which includes both internal activities and access to external programming. Our on-going engagement program includes periodic walks of our stores and other facilities and in-depth meetings with management to provide our directors with the opportunity to observe our strategic initiatives in action and to expand their insight into business operations and activities. We also have a structured director orientation program for new directors during their first year on the Board. This program includes information sessions with committee chairs and senior management and visits to our stores and facilities to accelerate their on-boarding. We also provide all directors with membership in the National Association of Corporate Directors and continuing education opportunities. Board Self-Evaluations Each year, the Board, as required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, conducts an evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. As set forth in its charter, the NCG Committee oversee this process, which includes two key components. First, the Board and each committee conduct self-evaluations in executive session, generally at the first regularly scheduled meetings of the fiscal year. These self-evaluations solicit feedback on a range of issues, including Board and committee structure, culture and dynamics; meeting content; and interactions with management. Second, our Lead Director conducts individual interviews with each of the directors. These interviews address similar topics, with the one-on-one setting permitting more detailed feedback on Board operations and director performance, as well as providing opportunities for mentoring newer directors. The feedback from these interviews is discussed with the full Board at its February meeting. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE The Director Independence Standards in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available on the Company’s Investor Relations website at http://ir.homedepot.com under “Corporate Governance > Overview,” exceed the independence standards adopted by the NYSE. Pursuant to these Guidelines, the Board and the NCG Committee reviewed the independence of each current director in early 2019 . During this review, the Board and the NCG Committee considered all relevant facts and circumstances related to transactions and relationships between each director (and his or her immediate family and affiliates) and the Company and its management 8 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents to determine whether any such relationship or transaction would prohibit a director from being independent under SEC rules, NYSE listing standards and the Company’s Director Independence Standards. Based on this review and the recommendation of the NCG Committee, the Board affirmatively determined that all of our current directors and director nominees are independent except Craig A. Menear, our Chairman, CEO and President. The Company has purchase, sale and other transactions and relationships in the normal course of business with companies with which certain Company directors are associated but which our Board determined are not material to our Company, the directors or, except as otherwise indicated below, the companies with which the directors are associated. These transactions were reviewed and considered by the Board and the NCG Committee in determining the independence of Company directors. In particular, the Board and the NCG Committee took into account the following transactions during Fiscal 2018 : • Mr. Arpey served as a director of S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., from which we purchased cleaning supply merchandise. • Mr. Boyd served as Chairman of Booking Holdings Inc., from which we purchased travel-related services, and as a director of CLEAR, LLC, from which we purchased travel-related services. • Mr. Brenneman served as Executive Chairman of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC, which manages funds that have or had an equity interest in (1) The Hillman Companies, Inc. (“Hillman”), from which we purchased fasteners and other small hardware items; (2) Cabela’s Inc., from which we purchased outdoor goods; and (3) Shoes for Crews, from which we purchased footwear. In Fiscal 2018 , the Company was one of Hillman’s largest customers. Mr. Brenneman does not serve as a director or officer of any of these portfolio companies. • Mr. Brown served as Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer of General Atlantic LLC, which manages funds that have or had an equity interest in (1) Absolute Barbeque, from which we purchased food items; (2) Adyen B.V., from which we purchased payment services; (3) Airbnb, Inc., from which we purchased lodging services; (4) BuzzFeed, Inc., from which we purchased media services; (5) Flipp Corporation, from which we purchased digital retail services; (6) Mi9 Retail, Inc., from which we purchased software; (7) Mu Sigma Inc., from which we purchased data analytics consulting services; (8) Slack Technologies, from which we purchased collaboration technology services; (9) Snap, Inc., from which we purchased media services; (10) Torchy’s Tacos, from which we purchased food items; (11) Tory Burch, LLC, from which we purchased associate recognition gifts; (12) Typeform S.L., from which we purchased data collection software services; and (13) Uber Technologies, Inc., from which we purchased transportation services. Mr. Brown does not serve as a director or officer of any of these portfolio companies. • Mr. Carey served as Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo North America, from which we purchased food and beverage products. • Ms. Foulkes served as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors of Hudson’s Bay Company, from which we purchased associate gifts and apparel. • Ms. Gooden served as a director of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., from which we purchased payroll and tax services; and as a director of General Motors Company, from which we purchased automobiles and related services. • Mr. Hewett served as Non-Executive Chairman of DiversiTech Corporation, from which we purchased heating, ventilating, air conditioning, refrigeration and other related merchandise, and as a director of Wells Fargo & Company, from which we obtained banking and financial services. • Mr. Kadre served as a director of Republic Services, Inc., from which we purchased waste management services. • Ms. Linnartz served as Executive Vice President and Global Chief Commercial Officer of Marriott International, Inc., from which we purchased lodging and event-related services. • Mr. Vadon served as a director of Qurate Retail, Inc., from which we purchased digital goods and services, and as a director of New Engen, Inc. from which we purchased digital marketing services. In each instance described above, the amount of payments made and received by each entity represented an immaterial percentage of the Company’s and, except as otherwise stated above, the other entity’s revenues. The Board and the NCG Committee believe that all of the transactions and relationships during Fiscal 2018 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 9 described above were on arm’s-length terms that were reasonable and competitive and that the directors did not participate in or receive any direct personal benefit from these transactions. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS The NCG Committee reviews all related-party transactions involving a Board member or executive officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. To help identify related-party transactions, each director and executive officer completes a questionnaire that requires the disclosure of any transaction that the person, or any member of his or her immediate family, has or will have with the Company. Our GC also conducts an independent investigation that includes a review of the Company’s financial systems to determine if a director or executive officer, or a company with which he or she is affiliated, engaged in transactions with the Company during the fiscal year. In accordance with its charter, the NCG Committee reviews and approves, ratifies or rejects any transaction involving a related party that is identified. In approving, ratifying or rejecting a related-party transaction, the NCG Committee considers such information as it deems important to determine whether the transaction is on reasonable and competitive terms and is fair to the Company. Transactions that are determined to be directly or indirectly material to the Company or a related party are disclosed in the Company’s Proxy Statement. During Fiscal 2018 , there were no related-party transactions that require disclosure in this Proxy Statement. SELECTING NOMINEES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS The NCG Committee is responsible for considering candidates for the Board and recommending director nominees to the Board. All members of the NCG Committee have been determined to be independent by the Board pursuant to SEC rules, NYSE listing standards and the Company’s Director Independence Standards. The NCG Committee considers candidates for nomination to the Board from a number of sources. Current members of the Board are considered for re-election unless they have notified the Company that they do not wish to stand for re-election and provided they have not reached age 72 by the calendar year-end immediately preceding the Company’s next annual meeting of shareholders. The NCG Committee may also consider candidates recommended by current members of the Board, members of management and shareholders, as discussed below under “Director Candidates Recommended by Shareholders.” From time to time, the NCG Committee engages independent search firms to assist in identifying potential Board candidates. Services provided by the search firms include identifying and assessing potential director candidates meeting criteria established by the NCG Committee, verifying information about the prospective candidate’s credentials, and obtaining a preliminary indication of interest and willingness to serve as a Board member. During Fiscal 2018 , the NCG Committee engaged the third-party search firm Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. to assist it in identifying and assessing potential director candidates. Mr. Kadre, who was appointed to our board in October 2018, was recommended by a non-employee director, and the search firm assisted with his assessment. The NCG Committee evaluates all candidates, regardless of who recommended the candidate, based on the same criteria. The criteria and the process by which director nominees are considered and selected are discussed further below under “Election of Directors.” DIRECTOR CANDIDATES RECOMMENDED BY SHAREHOLDERS The NCG Committee will consider all candidates recommended by a shareholder (or group of shareholders) who owns at least 1% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock and who has held such shares for at least one year as of the date of the recommendation. If the shareholder does not meet these requirements, the NCG Committee may, but is not obligated to, evaluate the candidate and consider him or her for nomination to the Board. A shareholder wishing to recommend a candidate must submit the following documents to the Corporate Secretary, The Home Depot, Inc., 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Building C-22, Atlanta, Georgia 30339 not less than 120 calendar days prior to the anniversary of the date on which the Company’s Proxy Statement was released to shareholders in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting of shareholders: 10 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents • A recommendation that identifies the candidate and provides contact information for that candidate; • The written consent of the candidate to serve as a director of the Company, if elected; and • Documentation establishing that the shareholder making the recommendation meets the ownership requirements set forth above. If the candidate is to be evaluated by the NCG Committee, the Corporate Secretary will request from the candidate a detailed résumé, an autobiographical statement explaining the candidate’s interest in serving as a director of the Company, a completed statement regarding conflicts of interest, and a waiver of liability for a background check. These documents must be received from the candidate before the first day of February preceding the annual meeting of shareholders. COMMUNICATING WITH THE BOARD Shareholders and others who are interested in communicating directly with the Board, our Lead Director, or other independent directors, including those wishing to express concerns relating to accounting, internal controls, audit matters, fraud or unethical behavior, may do so by e-mail at HD_Directors@homedepot.com or by writing to the directors at the following address: [Name of Director or Directors] c/o Corporate Secretary The Home Depot, Inc. 2455 Paces Ferry Road Building C-22 Atlanta, Georgia 30339 The Corporate Secretary reviews and provides the Board and the NCG Committee with a summary of all such communications and a copy of any correspondence that, in the opinion of the Corporate Secretary, deals with the functions of the Board or the standing committees of the Board or that otherwise requires the attention of the Board and the NCG Committee. Correspondence relating to accounting, internal controls or auditing matters is brought to the attention of the Company’s internal audit department and, if appropriate, to the Audit Committee. All communications are treated confidentially. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 11 Table of Contents E LECTION OF D IRECTORS (ITEM 1 ON THE PROXY CARD) The Board is elected annually by shareholders to oversee the long-term health and the overall success and financial strength of the Company’s business. The NCG Committee is responsible for considering candidates for the Board and recommending director nominees for the Board. DIRECTOR CRITERIA AND QUALIFICATIONS The NCG Committee, when considering the composition of our Board, focuses on ensuring a mix of directors that collectively possess the breadth of expertise and experience appropriate for a retailer of our size and geographic scope. The Company is the world’s largest home improvement retailer, with more than 2,280 retail stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and our business involves all facets of retail, including merchandising, supply chain, finance, real estate, human resources, information technology and cybersecurity, e-commerce, strategic management, marketing and communications, international commerce, and corporate governance. The NCG Committee evaluates each director candidate on the basis of the length, breadth and quality of the candidate’s business experience, the applicability of the candidate’s skills and expertise to the Company’s business and strategic direction, the perspectives that the candidate would bring to the entire Board, and the personality or “fit” of the candidate with existing members of the Board and management. The NCG Committee seeks directors who can: • Demonstrate integrity, accountability, informed judgment, financial literacy, creativity and vision; • Be prepared to represent the best interests of all Company shareholders and not just one particular constituency; • Demonstrate a record of professional accomplishment in his or her chosen field; and • Be prepared and able to participate fully in Board activities, including membership on at least two committees. BOARD REFRESHMENT AND DIVERSITY We routinely assess the composition of the Board and aim to strike a balance between the knowledge and understanding of the business that comes from longer-term service on the Board and the fresh ideas and perspective that can come from adding new members. We also consider the expertise and cognitive diversity that is needed as our business changes and expands. As explained in more detail below, we also recognize the importance of having diversity of age, gender, race and ethnicity on the Board. Our independent director nominees have a balance of tenure, age and diversity, which provides our Board with an effective mix of experience and fresh perspective 12 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents The retail landscape has rapidly evolved over the past ten years, and, if anything, the pace of change is expected to accelerate in the future. We believe that Board refreshment is critical as the Company’s business strategy continues to evolve with the competitive landscape, particularly as we build the One Home Depot experience. In the past six years, we have added seven new independent directors, comprising over 50% of our current Board. Several of these directors have first-hand experience building an interconnected experience for their own companies’ customers. At the same time, we believe that we benefit from having several seasoned directors, including our Lead Director, who are well-versed in the Company’s business and help facilitate the transfer of institutional knowledge. Having a tenured Lead Director who has served with four of our CEOs and through several different business cycles has proven extremely valuable, particularly as we have added new Board members and experienced senior management transitions. We believe the average tenure of our independent directors reflects the balance the Board seeks between different perspectives brought by long-serving and new directors. In addition, the NCG Committee recognizes the importance of selecting directors from various backgrounds and professions to ensure that the Board as a whole has a wealth of experiences and perspectives to inform its decisions and enhance its cognitive diversity. We believe diversity makes our business stronger and more innovative. In addition to focusing on the skills and experience necessary to meet the core needs of the Company, the NCG Committee considers the ability of the candidate to contribute to the Board by leveraging and valuing a broad set of experiences, including the director’s ethnic, gender, generational, and racial diversity. To accomplish this goal, the NCG Committee is committed to including in each director search candidates who reflect diverse backgrounds, including diversity of race and gender. The NCG Committee assesses the composition, including the diversity, of the Board at least once a year and more frequently as needed, particularly when considering potential new candidates. 2019 DIRECTOR NOMINEES After evaluating the performance and experience of each of the current directors and the composition of the full Board, the NCG Committee and the Board have recommended the election of 12 of our 14 incumbent Board members. As noted earlier, Mr. Codina reached age 72 in 2018. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, he is not standing for re-election and is retiring from service on the Board at the Meeting. In addition, Mr. Vadon is stepping down from the Board at the Meeting at the end of his current term. As detailed in the table below and in each director’s biography below, our Board collectively leverages its strengths in the following areas: The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 13 Table of Contents The table below summarizes why these skills, qualifications and attributes are important to us and how the composition of our nominees for the Board, as a whole, meets these needs.

As part of this responsibility, the Audit Committee annually evaluates the independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications, performance and independence and assesses whether to continue to retain the firm or select a different firm. The Audit Committee and its Chair are also involved in and approve the selection of the lead audit partner, who is limited to no more than five consecutive years in that role before the position must be rotated in accordance with SEC rules. Pursuant to these requirements, we will have a new lead partner in Fiscal 2019. The Audit Committee was directly involved in the selection of the new lead partner. The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG to serve as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2019 . KPMG (or its predecessor firms) has served in that capacity for the Company since 1979. The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of KPMG as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Although we are not required to submit this matter to shareholders, the Board believes that it is a sound corporate governance practice to seek shareholder ratification of the appointment of KPMG. If shareholders do not ratify the appointment of KPMG, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment. Even if the appointment of KPMG is ratified by shareholders, the Audit Committee in its discretion may change the appointment at any time if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company. One or more representatives of KPMG will be present at the Meeting. The representatives will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire and will be available to respond to questions from shareholders.

PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES The Audit Committee has adopted a policy regarding the retention of the independent registered public accounting firm that requires pre-approval of all services by the Audit Committee or by the Chair of the Audit Committee. Prior to the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm, our Audit Committee pre-approves the above-described services by category of service and maximum amount of fees per category. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval or for services in excess of the originally pre-approved amount. In those instances, our Audit Committee requires that we obtain specific pre-approval for those services. If pre-approval is required between Audit Committee meetings, the Chair of the Audit Committee may pre-approve the services, provided that notice of such pre-approval is given to the other members of the Audit Committee and presented to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 23 Table of Contents A DVISORY V OTE TO A PPROVE E XECUTIVE C OMPENSATION (“S AY-ON- P AY ”) (ITEM 3 ON THE PROXY CARD) In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Company provides its shareholders with the opportunity each year to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers. The Company recommends that you vote for the approval of the compensation of our NEOs as described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, you may vote on the following resolution at the Meeting: RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables, and the related narrative disclosure in the Company’s Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 32 and our “ Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Report Card” on page 34, the Company’s compensation philosophy is to align executive pay with Company performance. We believe that this alignment motivates our executives to achieve our key financial and strategic goals, creating long-term shareholder value. Our executive compensation program links pay to performance as follows: ü Approximately 88.4% of the Fiscal 2018 target compensation for our CEO and approximately 80.0% of the Fiscal 2018 target compensation for our other NEOs was variable and paid based upon attainment of our pre-determined corporate performance objectives or the performance of our common stock. ü For Fiscal 2018 , approximately 65% of our CEO’s target compensation and approximately 58% of the target compensation of our other NEOs was equity-based and paid in a mix of performance shares, performance-based restricted stock, and options. ü Our NEOs do not receive tax reimbursements (also known as “gross-ups”), supplemental executive retirement plans, defined benefit pension plans, guaranteed salary increases or guaranteed bonuses and have limited perquisites. ü We employ a number of mechanisms to mitigate the chance of our compensation programs encouraging excessive risk taking, including an annual review and risk assessment of all elements of compensation by the LDC Committee, a compensation recoupment policy, stock ownership guidelines, and an anti-hedging policy. Because the vote on this proposal is advisory in nature, it will not affect any compensation already paid or awarded to any NEO and will not be binding on or overrule any decisions by the LDC Committee or the Board. Because we value our shareholders’ views, however, the LDC Committee and the Board will consider the results of this advisory vote when formulating future executive compensation policy. As noted on page 38 in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the LDC Committee considered the result of last year’s vote, in which over 97% of the shares voted were voted in support of the compensation of the Company’s NEOs. Your advisory vote serves as an additional tool to guide the LDC Committee and the Board in continuing to align the Company’s executive compensation program with the interests of the Company and its shareholders and is consistent with our commitment to high standards of corporate governance. This vote is not intended to express a view on any specific element of compensation, but rather on the overall NEO compensation program and philosophy as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables, and the related narrative disclosure as set forth below under “Executive Compensation.” We encourage you to carefully review these disclosures and to indicate your support for NEO compensation program. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS PRESENTED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. 24 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents S HAREHOLDER P ROPOSAL R EGARDING EEO-1 D ISCLOSURE (ITEM 4 ON THE PROXY CARD) The Congregation of Benedictine Sisters, Boerne, Texas, located at 285 Oblate Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78216, is the beneficial owner of more than $2,000 in shares of the Company’s common stock and has notified the Company of its intention to present the following proposal at the Meeting as lead proponent along with a number of other co-proponents. We will provide the name, address and amount of shares held by the co-proponents to shareholders promptly upon oral or written request. The Company is not responsible for the accuracy or content of the proposal, which is presented as received from the proponents in accordance with SEC rules. 2019 Home Depot Resolution EEO-1 Disclosure WHEREAS :  Equal employment opportunity (EEO) is a fair employment practice and an investment issue. We believe companies with good EEO records have a competitive advantage in recruiting/retaining employees. We believe Home Depot customers are increasingly diverse. A diverse work force is more likely to anticipate and respond effectively to consumer demand. EEO practices have economic relevance. Home Depot annually files an EEO-1 report with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This information could be made available to shareholders at a minimal additional cost. In 2001, Home Depot provided EEO information to investors upon request. Since then, Home Depot reversed policy on disclosure of this information. Allegations of discrimination in the workplace burden shareholders with costly litigation/fines which can damage a company’s reputation. Home Depot has paid out more than $100 million to settle discrimination lawsuits, including $87 million in a 1997 settlement and $5.5 million to settle charges of class-wide gender, race and national origin discrimination at 30 Colorado stores. In 2015, Home Depot settled a gender discrimination lawsuit for $83,400, alleging that women who were qualified for sales positions were relegated to cashiers jobs. In 2016, Judge David Carter approved a $3 million Home Depot class action lawsuit settlement, ending allegations that Home Depot violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) by using improper background check forms on job applications. Home Depot agreed to comply with FCRA. In 2018, an EEOC lawsuit was resolved with Home Depot paying $100,000 for failing to accommodate and then firing an employee with a disability-related emergency. The Peru, Illinois store is required to provided ADA training and semi-annual reporting to the EEOC. In 2018, 48.3% of Home Depot shares voted (counting votes for and against) supported this proposal. RESOLVED : Shareholders request that Home Depot prepare a diversity report, at reasonable cost and omitting confidential information, available to investors by September 2019, including the following: 1.  A chart identifying employees according to their gender and race in each of the nine major EEOC-defined job categories for the last three years, listing numbers or percentages in each category; 2.  A summary description of any affirmative action policies and programs to improve performance, including job categories where women and minorities are underutilized; 3.  A description of policies/programs oriented toward increasing diversity in the workplace. SUPPORTING STATEMENT : In 2015, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reported racial minorities comprised 37.2 percent of the private industry workforce, but just 14.01 percent of executives and managers. Likewise, women represented 47.85 percent of the workforce, but just 29.73 percent of executives and managers. We agree with a recommendation of the 1995 bipartisan Glass Ceiling Commission that “public disclosure of diversity data—specifically data on the most senior positions—is an effective incentive to develop and maintain innovative, effective programs to break the glass ceiling barriers.” Home Depot has demonstrated leadership on many corporate social responsibility issues. We ask the company to again demonstrate leadership in diversity by committing to EEO disclosure. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 25 Table of Contents R ESPONSE TO P ROPOSAL R EGARDING EEO-1 D ISCLOSURE The Board recommends that you vote against this shareholder proposal . One of the Company’s core values is Respect for All People, and we strive to foster a culture that encourages, supports, leverages, and values diversity and inclusion. In late 2018, we released a diversity report, which can be found on our website at http://ir.homedepot.com/esg-investors under “FY2017 Workforce Diversity,” disclosing gender and ethnicity statistics for our U.S. workforce. This report better aligns with our corporate structure than EEO-1 reporting, reflects feedback from our shareholders, and we believe provides a more useful comparison for those shareholders. As previously discussed in this Proxy Statement, following our 2018 annual meeting, we launched an enhanced ESG engagement program with shareholders representing over 40% of our outstanding shares to discuss a number of environmental, social and governance matters, including our disclosures regarding diversity and inclusion. The general feedback that we received from those engagements was that while our shareholders desired disclosure of diversity data at some level, the narrow, prescribed EEO-1 categories were not specifically what they were looking for. Instead, they wanted disclosure that is relevant to the Company; is structured in a way that is more aligned with how the Board, the LDC Committee, and management view our diversity and inclusion initiatives; and is easily understood and comparable to information provided by other similarly situated companies. In response to this feedback, we released a diversity report in late 2018 disclosing gender and ethnicity statistics for our U.S. workforce, including U.S. associates as a whole, those at the manager level and above (excluding officers), and officers, as well as our Board. This report provides a better alignment to our organization’s titles and report structure than the EEO - 1 categories. This information supplements our previously existing disclosures regarding our diversity and inclusion initiatives, discussed below and in our 2018 Responsibility Report, which can be found on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility. Going forward, we plan to include this diversity data in our annual Responsibility Report. As discussed in more detail in our 2018 Responsibility Report, we are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive environment for our associates. We are also focused on attracting, retaining and developing diverse talent, which ensures that the composition of our customers and our communities are reflected and represented in our Company. We maintain a team of associates led by our Chief Diversity Officer that provides focused leadership in developing a diverse and inclusive work environment in which all associates are valued, respected, encouraged and supported to do their best work. Our commitment to diversity is also reflected in the makeup of our senior leadership team and our Board. In 2017, our CEO joined the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, pledging our commitment to ensure the continued advancement of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. We have also taken a number of other steps to promote our diversity and inclusion initiatives within our strategic framework, including the following: • We maintain a diversity microsite on The Home Depot careers website, available at careers.homedepot.com > Culture > Diversity, which provides potential candidates with a unique perspective into our diverse and inclusive culture and workforce. In addition, we use an employment marketing strategy that enables us to source and recruit diverse associates through such avenues as national and local career fairs, social media, and multilingual ads and flyers. • We partner with several diverse local and national organizations, such as Catalyst, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), National Urban League, Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility and the National Association of Chinese Americans, to promote community involvement and both attract and develop diverse talent. • Our internal communication strategy includes diversity and inclusion messaging focused on increasing cultural awareness and reiterating the importance of diversity and inclusion as core values. This includes focused communications in our stores and featured articles on our internal website showcasing associate accomplishments and opportunities for growth and development. • We engage our associates through our seven Associate Resource Groups (“ARGs”), which are comprised of associates with an interest in the following dimensions of diversity: African-American, Disabled, Hispanic/Latino, LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender), Military, Pan-Asian and Women. Our ARGs are committed to supporting the Company’s business objectives and driving associate engagement through professional development, cultural awareness and community outreach. 26 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents • In addition to diversity and inclusion training for all leaders, we develop our leaders’ capabilities through our Leaders Inclusion Network. This program builds on our Women in Leadership efforts with a gender-balanced approach to promote inclusion and empower leaders to champion diverse talent. In 2018, we also launched unconscious bias training for all officers. • Our LDC Committee, which oversees our diversity and inclusion efforts, is committed to promoting diversity throughout the Company. The LDC Committee reviews our diversity and inclusion strategy and initiatives on at least an annual basis. The Board does not believe adoption of this proposal would enhance the Company’s existing commitment to diversity and inclusion in any meaningful way. Several of the items requested by the proponent are duplicative of matters discussed in our 2018 Responsibility Report. With respect to EEO-1 data, we do not believe that public dissemination of this information would promote the goal of increasing diversity. A Form EEO-1 is a confidential standardized form that requires companies to categorize their workforce solely by gender and race according to EEOC-defined generalized job categories that are applied across a broad variety of industries and companies. While management does track and review these categories for compliance purposes, they do not reflect the way we monitor the Company’s progress against its diversity and inclusion initiatives. Moreover, the information cited as justification for the shareholder proposal does not support the requested disclosure. One of the referenced matters is more than 20 years old. The others involve isolated legal claims that, for a company with more than 400,000 employees, are not in any way representative of our culture or commitment to diversity and inclusion or reflective of our legal compliance. We believe that the additional diversity data we released in 2018, along with the information provided above and in our Responsibility Report, better reflects our diversity and inclusion commitment and initiatives. We also believe this disclosure is more consistent with the data provided by our peers, to the extent they provide diversity statistics at all, and accordingly presents a more useful comparison for our shareholders to review. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE “AGAINST” THE ADOPTION OF THIS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 27 Table of Contents S HAREHOLDER P ROPOSAL R EGARDING S PECIAL S HAREHOLDER M EETINGS (ITEM 5 ON THE PROXY CARD) Mr. John Chevedden, located at 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, is the beneficial owner of at least 100 shares of the Company’s common stock and has notified the Company of his intention to present the following proposal at the Meeting. The Company is not responsible for the accuracy or content of the proposal, which is presented as received from the proponent in accordance with SEC rules. Proposal 5 – Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement Resolved, Shareowners ask our board to take the steps necessary (unilaterally if possible) to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document to give holders in the aggregate of 10% of our outstanding common stock the power to call a special shareowner meeting (or the closest percentage to 10% according to state law). This proposal does not impact our board’s current power to call a special meeting. Our current higher 25%-threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting may be unreachable due to the prescribed time constraints and detailed technical requirements. Also our right to shareholder proxy access may be unreachable because it can only be used by 20 shareholders who have owned a total of $6 billion of Home Depot stock continuously for 3-years. If one can find 21 shareholders who meet this enormous $6 billion threshold – one is totally out of luck. Special meetings allow shareowners to vote on important matters, such as electing new directors that can arise between annual meetings. This proposal topic won more than 70%-support at Edwards Lifesciences and SunEdison in 2013. This proposal topic also won 44%-support at the 2018 Home Depot annual meeting. This 44%-support could translate into 51%-support from the shareholders who had access to independent proxy voting advice. We also did not have confidential voting. Thus management could have applied extra pressure to certain shareholders who initially voted in favor of the 2018 shareholder proposal. And in the one-year period leading up to the due date for this proposal Home Depot stock fell from $180 to $170 which was not the case last year. A shareholder ability to call a special meeting would put shareholders in a better position to give continuing input on improving the makeup of our board of directors. This topic is more important since we do not have oversight of our CEO by an independent Board Chairman. Carlos Ghosn, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Immelt and Elon Musk are examples of problems with concentrating too much power in one person. At Home Depot the Lead Director has limited oversight of our CEO/Chairman. However Gregory Brenneman, Lead Director, had the longest tenure by far of any Home Depot director – 18-years. Long-tenure can impair the independence of a director no matter how well qualified. Independence is a priceless attribute in a director, especially a Lead Director. Plus Armando Codina chaired our corporate governance committee. Mr. Codina was flagged due to his prior position with at least one company that went bankrupt. Please vote yes: Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement – Proposal 5 28 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents R ESPONSE TO P ROPOSAL R EGARDING S PECIAL S HAREHOLDER M EETINGS The Board recommends that you vote against this shareholder proposal . Our shareholders have had the right to call a special meeting of shareholders since 2009. Until February 2019, the threshold required to call such a meeting was 25% of our common stock. In February 2019, responding to shareholder feedback, our Board reduced the threshold to 15%. The further reduction to 10% sought by this proposal is not warranted in light of the governance best practices that we already have in place. We believe that a special meeting should only be held to cover special or extraordinary events when fiduciary, strategic, significant transactional or similar considerations dictate that the matter be addressed on an expeditious basis, rather than waiting until the next annual meeting. Organizing and preparing for a special meeting involves significant management commitment of time and focus, and imposes substantial legal, administrative and distribution costs. Our Board believes that setting the threshold too low would carry a risk of meeting requests promoting agenda items relevant to particular constituencies as opposed to shareholders generally, while generating significant cost and management distraction. Our shareholders have been asked to vote on a proposal lowering the threshold every year since 2014, and while the proposal did not pass, we decided to include the special meeting threshold in the topics discussed as part of our expanded ESG shareholder engagement program since our last annual meeting. As previously noted in this Proxy Statement, we had discussions with holders representing over 40% of our outstanding shares as part of that program. While there were disparate views expressed on our threshold, with a number of holders still supportive of the 25% threshold, there was a general consensus that given our market capitalization, 25% of outstanding shares could represent a very high hurdle to meet. At the same time, many shareholders with whom we spoke believed that a 10% threshold, as proposed by the proponent, was too low. Our Board considered this feedback, and in February 2019, the Board approved an amendment to our By-Laws reducing the threshold to call a special meeting to at least 15% of outstanding shares. The Board believes that a 15% threshold strikes a balance between the risks inherent in setting the threshold too low while at the same time providing an opportunity for shareholders to call a meeting in the appropriate circumstances. As noted in our Corporate Governance Factsheet, located on our Investor Relations website at http://ir.homedepot.com under “Corporate Governance > Factsheet,” in addition to a shareholder right to call a special meeting, we have adopted extensive governance best practices. We provide our shareholders with a proxy access right, as well as majority voting for directors, annual director elections, and a shareholder right to act by majority written consent. In addition, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has consistently rated us as having a low corporate governance risk under its QualityScore governance rating system. When viewed together with our robust corporate governance practices and the many shareholder protections that we have adopted, we believe that our current 15% special meeting threshold is appropriate, and enhances shareholder rights while still ensuring appropriate support among shareholders is required to call a special meeting. Therefore, in the best interests of our shareholders and Company and in light of the many shareholder protections we already have in place, we recommend that you vote against this shareholder proposal. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE “AGAINST” THE ADOPTION OF THIS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL.

Funded Pension Plan, located at PO Box 301840, Boston, MA 02130, is the beneficial owner of more than $2,000 in shares of the Company’s common stock and has notified the Company of its intention to present the following proposal at the Meeting. The Company is not responsible for the accuracy or content of the proposal, which is presented as received from the proponent in accordance with SEC rules. WHEREAS : The use of services derived from or sale of goods produced through correctional industries (prison labor) can pose financial and operational risks including supply chain disruption, litigation, and reputational damage; Prison labor (both voluntary and involuntary) is often deployed in a manner that involves prisoner mistreatment and is frequently compared to modern slavery. Although companies benefit from low overhead expenses when inmates work for the company or its suppliers, companies have experienced public backlash, boycotts, and long-term brand name and reputation harm from a connection to prison labor; Prisoners are involved in producing a variety of products such as furniture, circuit boards, packaging materials, electronic equipment, and providing services such as call center or shipping services. U.S. prisoners may be paid as little as $0.23 - $1.15 per hour for work that sometimes occurs in unsafe or unhealthy conditions, and in some prison industries inmates may be coerced into working by threat of punishment for declining work; Our Company appears to prohibit forced prison labor but not all forms of prison labor. Our company’s Responsible Sourcing Standards state that “Suppliers will not use of any [sic] form of involuntary labor including forced, prison, indentured, bonded, slave or human-trafficked labor” [emphasis added]; In 2017, a lawsuit was filed against a Home Depot supplier that made dock floats for sale in our stores and other retailers using unpaid, forced punitive labor in the U.S. Given that it does not appear that Home Depot requires third party audits of products made in the United States, this example illustrates the need for a full review of our company’s supply chain for exposure to this risk; Careful review of our supply chain for voluntary and involuntary prison labor would help ensure that Home Depot suppliers are consistent with Company policies and minimize risks to Home Depot’s reputation and shareholder value. RESOLVED: Shareholders of Home Depot urge the Board of Directors to produce an annual report to shareholders on prison labor, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, summarizing the extent of known usage of prison labor in the company’s supply chain. SUPPORTING STATEMENT :  Shareholders recommend that the report: • Include annual quantitative metrics regarding the number of supplier audits conducted by the Company which evaluated whether prison labor is present in the supply chain, as well as the summary of those results. • Evaluate any risks to finances, operations, and reputation related to prison labor in the Home Depot supply chain. 30 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents R ESPONSE TO P ROPOSAL R EGARDING R EPORT ON P RISON L ABOR IN THE S UPPLY C HAIN The Board recommends that you vote against this shareholder proposal . The Company currently has in place a responsible sourcing program to support our efforts to conduct our business in a responsible and ethical manner. The program, which uses a risk-based approach to assess and manage the many aspects of supply chain oversight, is discussed in detail in our 2018 Responsible Sourcing Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility/sourcing-responsibility. This program includes Responsible Sourcing Standards and guidelines, also available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility/sourcing-responsibility, which have historically prohibited any form of involuntary labor, including forced, prison, indentured, bonded, slave, or human trafficked labor. Our suppliers are required to agree to comply with these Responsible Sourcing Standards when we enter into a contract with them, acknowledging that they will adhere to those standards as well as applicable laws and regulations. We have a number of measures in place, including on-site audits of factories producing private brand and direct import products for us, review of records, confidential interviews, training, and a website and alert lines for anonymous reporting, to monitor and support compliance with our standards. Our suppliers are expected to promptly take corrective action to remediate any noncompliance, and the Company reserves the right to terminate its relationship with any supplier who is unwilling to comply with our standards. On an annual basis, our Audit Committee receives a report on our responsible sourcing program. The 2018 Responsible Sourcing Report, which reports on actions taken in 2017, notes that we performed 1,165 factory audits in 2017 in 28 countries. In 2018, we conducted 1,362 factory audits in 29 countries. All of our audits assess whether there is any use of prison labor. None of the audits in 2017 or 2018 identified any use of prison labor. Notwithstanding our existing policy, in early 2019, following analysis of our supply chain as well as information from peer companies and organizations like the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”), we updated and expanded our standards with respect to forced labor to better address practices that can create an environment in which labor is forced even if it appears voluntary on its face. These standards, which can be found at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility/sourcing-responsibility, prohibit our suppliers from using forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery or human trafficking. This includes transporting, harboring, recruiting, transferring or receiving persons by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction or fraud for labor or services. Any use of prison or convict labor must not be forced and must be consistent both with the laws where the products are manufactured and the laws where they are imported. The updated standards also provide specific requirements regarding worker’s freedom of movement, hiring practices, ability to terminate employment, access to identity or immigration documents, and payment of recruiting fees. These standards are based on the code of conduct provided by the RBA, the world’s largest industry coalition dedicated to corporate social responsibility in global supply chains. We also joined the RBA’s Responsible Labor Initiative, a multi-industry, multi-stakeholder initiative focused on ensuring that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced labor in global supply chains are consistently respected and promoted. Membership in the Responsible Labor Initiative provides access to best practices, tools, partnerships and other resources to better enable us to understand emerging issues, enhance our forced labor due diligence program, and assist us in meeting regulatory requirements. We believe the actions we have taken to address the use of forced labor in the manufacture of products that we sell, including recent updates to our standards and membership in the Responsible Labor Initiative, are appropriate and use a reasonable, risk-based approach to supply chain oversight. Prison labor is but one of many areas that we have to evaluate as part of our extensive program for achieving compliance with our Responsible Sourcing Standards. Similarly, we believe that reporting on the program as a whole, as we do in our Responsible Sourcing Report, is a more effective and prudent use of corporate resources and better serves the interests of shareholders.

Menear, Chairman, CEO and President; • Carol B. Tomé, CFO and Executive Vice President – Corporate Services; • Mark Q. Holifield, Executive Vice President – Supply Chain and Product Development; • Edward P. Decker, Executive Vice President – Merchandising; and • Matthew A. Carey, Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer. In Fiscal 2018 , all of the Executive Vice Presidents listed above reported directly to the CEO. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis is organized as follows: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 33 Fiscal 2018 Company Business Objectives and Performance 33 Compensation Philosophy and Objectives: Pay for Performance 33 Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Report Card: The Home Depot Pays for Performance 34 Performance-Based Features of Fiscal 2018 Compensation 35 Impact of Fiscal 2018 Business Results on Executive Compensation 35 Opportunity for Shareholder Feedback 35 COMPENSATION DETERMINATION PROCESS 36 Benchmarking 36 Mitigating Compensation Risk 37 Consideration of Last Year’s Say-on-Pay Vote 38 ELEMENTS OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAMS 38 Base Salaries 38 Annual Incentive 39 Long-Term Incentives 41 Deferred Compensation Plans 42 Perquisites 43 Other Benefits 43 MANAGEMENT OF COMPENSATION-RELATED RISK 43 SEVERANCE AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS 44 TAX DEDUCTIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS 44 32 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Fiscal 2018 Company Business Objectives and Performance The retail landscape is changing at an unprecedented rate. To address these changes and continue to grow our business, we began in Fiscal 2018 a multi-year investment program to create what we call the One Home Depot experience. Simply put, our vision for One Home Depot is a frictionless shopping experience that is aimed at allowing our customers to engage with us seamlessly across multiple channels. To accomplish this, we are investing approximately $11 billion over a multi-year period in our stores, associates, digital experience, and supply chain. This process is supported by five core strategies aimed at connecting the business end to end.  The five strategies, which are discussed in more detail in our 2018 Form 10-K, are: • Connect Associates to Customer Needs • Interconnected Experience: Store to Online, Online to Store • Connect Products and Services to Customer Needs • Connect Product to Shelf, Site and Customer • Innovate Our Business Model and Value Chain Our execution of these strategic initiatives is reflected in our Fiscal 2018 performance. Highlights of that performance include the following: • Increased net sales by 7.2% to $108.2 billion; • Increased operating income by 5.8% to $15.5 billion; • Increased net earnings by 28.9% to $11.1 billion and diluted earnings per share by 33.5% to $ 9.73 ; • Generated $13.0 billion in operating cash flow; and • Increased ROIC from 34.2% to 44.8% . As a result of our significant cash flow from operations and disciplined capital allocation, we were also able to return value to our shareholders during Fiscal 2018 through a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend for a total of $4.7 billion in dividends and $10.0 billion in share repurchases. And while our stock price decreased 11% from the beginning of Fiscal 2018 as a result of significant overall market volatility, our three- and five-year total shareholder return, or TSR, was 56.6% and 167.2% , respectively. Compensation Philosophy and Objectives: Pay for Performance We designed our compensation program for associates at all levels with the intent to align pay with performance. By doing so, we seek to motivate associate performance and enhance morale, which drives a superior customer experience. We believe this alignment encourages achievement of our strategic goals and creation of long-term shareholder value. The principal elements of our compensation program for executive officers are base salary, annual incentives and long-term incentives. We use a number of the financial metrics highlighted above, which drive shareholder value, as the key performance metrics in our compensation programs. This congruency aligns both pay with performance and executive interests with shareholder interests. The following Executive Compensation Report Card highlights the alignment between pay and performance for each of these elements of our compensation program for Fiscal 2018 . The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 33 Table of Contents FISCAL 2018 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION REPORT CARD: THE HOME DEPOT PAYS FOR PERFORMANCE Approximately 88.4% of our CEO’s target compensation for Fiscal 2018 (approximately 80.0% on average for our other NEOs) was at risk and contingent upon the achievement of corporate performance objectives and/or share price performance.

Dividends on performance-based restricted stock grants are accrued and not paid out to executive officers unless and until the performance goal is met. ü Our equity awards have longer vesting periods than many of our peers, with the performance-based restricted stock and stock options vesting over five years and the performance shares cliff vesting after three years (subject to achievement of performance goals), which better aligns executive officers’ interests with the interests of our shareholders in the long-term performance of the Company. ü Approximately 88.4% of our CEO’s total target compensation was tied to the achievement of corporate performance objectives and/or share price performance. ü We do not provide tax reimbursements, also known as “gross-ups,” to executive officers; we have limited perquisites; and we do not have any supplemental executive retirement plans, defined benefit pension plans, guaranteed salary increases or guaranteed bonuses. ü We prohibit all associates, officers and directors from entering into hedging or monetization transactions designed to limit the financial risk of owning Company stock. Impact of Fiscal 2018 Business Results on Executive Compensation The amount of incentive compensation paid to our executive officers, if any, is determined by our performance against our Fiscal 2018 business plan, a plan intended to be challenging in light of prevailing economic conditions, yet attainable through disciplined execution of our strategic initiatives. The compensation earned by our NEOs in Fiscal 2018 reflects our corporate performance for the fiscal year: • The LDC Committee approved salary increases for the NEOs based on its assessment of individual performance and other factors, as discussed in more detail below; • Our MIP paid out slightly below the target performance level, reflecting sales performance above target, but operating profit and inventory turns below target; • The performance condition on the performance-based restricted stock granted in Fiscal 2018 was satisfied, although the shares still remain subject to service-based vesting requirements; and • The NEOs earned approximately 150.1% of their 2016 - 2018 performance share award because we achieved average ROIC and operating profit over the three-year performance period of 34.8% and $14.49 billion, respectively, reflecting performance in excess of the target level for each metric. Opportunity for Shareholder Feedback The LDC Committee carefully considers feedback from our shareholders regarding executive compensation matters. Shareholders are invited to express their views or concerns directly to the LDC Committee or the Board in the manner described under “Communicating with the Board” on page 11 of this Proxy Statement. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 35 Table of Contents COMPENSATION DETERMINATION PROCESS Participant Role in the Executive Compensation Determination Process Independent Members of the Board • The independent members of the Board, consisting of all directors other than Mr. Menear, evaluated the performance and determined the compensation of the CEO. LDC Committee • The LDC Committee evaluated the performance and determined the compensation of our executive officers other than the CEO. • The LDC Committee evaluated the CEO’s performance and made recommendations to the independent members of the Board regarding compensation for the CEO. • The LDC Committee may delegate its responsibilities to subcommittees, but did not delegate any of its authority with respect to the compensation of any executive officer for Fiscal 2018. Executive Officers • The CEO and the EVP-HR made recommendations to the LDC Committee as to the amount and form of executive compensation for executive officers (other than the CEO and the EVP-HR). • At the request of the LDC Committee, both the EVP-HR and the CEO regularly attended LDC Committee meetings, excluding executive sessions where their respective compensation and other matters were discussed. Independent Compensation Consultant • In November 2017, the LDC Committee engaged Pay Governance LLC as its independent compensation consultant for Fiscal 2018 to provide research, market data, survey information and design expertise in developing executive and director compensation programs. Pay Governance provides consulting services solely to compensation committees. • A representative of Pay Governance attended LDC Committee meetings in Fiscal 2018 and advised the LDC Committee on all principal aspects of executive compensation, including the competitiveness of program design and award values and specific analyses with respect to the Company’s executive officers, including the CEO. The compensation consultant reports directly to the LDC Committee, and the LDC Committee is free to replace the consultant or hire additional consultants or advisers at any time. • Pursuant to the independent compensation consultant policy adopted by the LDC Committee, its compensation consultant provides services solely to the LDC Committee and is prohibited from providing services or products of any kind to the Company. Further, affiliates of the compensation consultant may not receive payments from the Company that would exceed 2% of the consolidated gross revenues of the compensation consultant and its affiliates during any year. • Pay Governance provided services solely to the LDC Committee in Fiscal 2018, and none of its affiliates provided any services to the Company. In addition, under the independent compensation consultant policy, the LDC Committee assessed Pay Governance’s independence and whether its work raised any conflicts of interest, taking into consideration the independence factors set forth in applicable SEC and NYSE rules. Based on that assessment, including review of a letter from Pay Governance addressing each of those factors, the LDC Committee determined that Pay Governance was independent and that its work did not raise any conflicts of interest. Benchmarking We do not target any specific peer group percentile ranking for total compensation or for any particular component of compensation for our NEOs. The LDC Committee considers each executive’s compensation history and peer group market position as reference points in awarding annual compensation. For our CEO, the LDC Committee considered data provided by Pay Governance from two peer groups. The first consisted of the Fortune 50 36 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents companies, excluding certain financial services and other companies due to their unique compensation structure. This group reflects companies of similar size and complexity to us. The second group, listed below, consisted of retailers with revenues greater than $10 billion with whom we compete for executive talent. Retail Peer Group AutoNation, Inc. Dollar Tree, Inc. Murphy USA, Inc. SuperValu Inc. AutoZone, Inc. Genuine Parts Company Nordstrom, Inc. Target Corporation Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Group 1 Automotive, Inc. Office Depot, Inc. The Gap, Inc. Best Buy Co., Inc. J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Penske Automotive Group, Inc. The Kroger Co. CarMax, Inc. Kohl’s Corporation QVC Group The TJX Companies, Inc. Costco Wholesale Corporation L Brands, Inc. Rite Aid Corporation Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. CVS Health Corporation Lowe’s Companies, Inc. Ross Stores, Inc. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Dollar General Corporation Macy’s, Inc. Sears Holding Corporation The retail peer group remained largely unchanged from Fiscal 2017 . We added QVC Group (now part of Qurate Retail, Inc.), which met the relevant criteria based on its 2017 revenue. We also removed Staples, Inc., which no longer met the relevant criteria. In reviewing the benchmarking data in connection with setting Mr. Menear’s Fiscal 2018 compensation, the LDC Committee and the independent directors also reviewed the percentile ranking of our revenues and Mr. Menear’s target total compensation compared to each of these peer groups, as reflected below: Percentile Rank Category Fortune 50 (2) Retail Peers Company Revenue (1) 56% 85% CEO Target Total Compensation 9% 55% (1) Based on fiscal 2017 revenue as reported in SEC filings. (2) Excludes Bank of America Corporation, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Citigroup Inc., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, JP Morgan Chase & Co., and Wells Fargo & Company. Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. were also excluded due to the atypical compensation structures of their founder/CEOs. Albertsons Companies, Inc., Dell Technologies and State Farm were excluded because they are private companies and did not disclose executive compensation data. For our other NEOs, the LDC Committee considered data from the Korn Ferry Hay Group Retail Industry Total Remuneration Survey, which provides information and comparisons on compensation for executive and industry-specific positions at the corporate and division level of retail companies. This survey data helps the LDC Committee understand the competitive market for the industry in which the Company principally competes for retail-specific talent and for customers. Mitigating Compensation Risk In November 2017 , the LDC Committee undertook its annual broad-based review and risk assessment of the proposed compensation policies and practices for the Company’s associates, including but not limited to our executive officers, for Fiscal 2018 . The assessment considered both qualitative and quantitative factors. Based on that assessment, management and the LDC Committee determined that our proposed compensation policies and practices did not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In reaching that conclusion, management and the LDC Committee considered the following qualitative and quantitative factors: Qualitative Factors : ü Management and the LDC Committee, with the advice of the independent compensation consultant, regularly review our executive compensation programs, with a focus on both their efficacy in driving quality performance and how the programs will be viewed by the investment community and other external constituencies. ü The LDC Committee and, for the CEO, the independent members of the Board, provide effective oversight in setting goals and monitoring attainment of those goals. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 37 Table of Contents ü Robust internal controls are in place to ensure compensation plans are operated as designed and approved. ü Compensation programs and pay amounts at multiple levels are routinely analyzed against market data by the LDC Committee and management to ensure compensation is appropriate to the market. ü Bonus, incentive and equity awards to executive officers are subject to a recoupment policy, as described below on page 43, to discourage manipulation of incentive program elements. ü Stock ownership guidelines are in place to further align the interests of shareholders and executive officers, as described below beginning on page 43. Quantitative Factors : ü Performance and payment time horizons are appropriate, and they are not overweight in short-term incentives. ü The relationship between the incremental achievement levels and corresponding payouts in our incentive plans is appropriate, and all incentives, other than equity incentives that are tied to growth in our share price, have payout caps. ü Programs employ a reasonable mix of performance metrics and are not overly concentrated on a single metric. Although the operating profit metric is used in more than one incentive, it is a key corporate goal, and the risk of overweighting it is mitigated by using it across different time horizons. ü Criteria for payments are closely aligned with our strategic initiatives, our financial plan and shareholder interests. ü Payout curves are reasonable and do not contain steep “cliffs” that might encourage unreasonable short-term business decisions to achieve payment thresholds. ü Equity for senior officers is paid in a mix of performance shares, performance-based restricted stock, and stock options; other associates receive equity in the form of service-based restricted stock. Consideration of Last Year’s Say-on-Pay Vote At our 2018 annual meeting on May 17, 2018 , over 97% of the shares voted were voted in support of the compensation of the Company’s NEOs. Since then, as part of our regular interaction with our institutional shareholders, we have continued to request input on our compensation practices. In considering the results of the 2018 advisory vote on executive compensation and feedback from these shareholders, the LDC Committee concluded that the compensation paid to our executive officers and the Company’s overall executive pay practices have strong shareholder support and therefore determined to maintain the current overall compensation structure for Fiscal 2018 . At our 2017 annual meeting on May 18, 2017, our shareholders expressed a preference that advisory votes on executive compensation occur every year, as recommended by our Board. Consistent with this preference, the Board implemented an annual advisory vote on executive compensation until the next advisory vote on the frequency of shareholder votes on executive compensation, which will occur no later than the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders in 2023. ELEMENTS OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAMS The principal elements of our compensation programs are discussed below. Base Salaries We provide competitive base salaries that allow us to attract and retain a high-performing leadership team. Base salaries for our NEOs are reviewed and generally adjusted annually based on a comprehensive management assessment process. For Fiscal 2018 , following discussion with the LDC Committee and based upon a review of competitive market data, the Company’s performance in Fiscal 2017 , and assessments of the Company’s business plan and anticipated economic conditions in Fiscal 2018 , we established a Company-wide merit increase budget of between 2.5% and 3.0%. 38 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents The LDC Committee performed its annual review of base salaries for the NEOs in late February 2018 , with changes effective in April 2018 . In establishing the actual base salaries for the NEOs for Fiscal 2018 , the LDC Committee considered total compensation, scope of responsibilities, performance over the previous year, experience, internal pay equity, potential to assume additional responsibilities, and the competitive marketplace. As a result of this assessment, Ms. Tomé and Messrs. Holifield, Decker and Carey received annual salary increases in April 2018 of between 2.5% and 2.7%, as set forth in the table below. At Mr. Menear’s request, and following discussion with the LDC Committee and its independent compensation consultant, the independent members of the Board maintained Mr. Menear’s base salary at $1,300,000. His salary has therefore remained unchanged since his appointment to the position of CEO and President effective November 1, 2014. Name 2018 Base Salary 2017 Base Salary Percent Increase Craig A. Menear $1,300,000 $1,300,000 — Carol B. Tomé $1,140,000 $1,110,000 2.7% Mark Q. Holifield $820,000 $800,000 2.5% Edward P. Decker $810,000 $790,000 2.5% Matthew A. Carey $775,000 $755,000 2.6% Annual Incentive All NEOs participate in the MIP, our cash-based annual incentive plan. The Fiscal 2018 MIP payout was contingent upon the achievement of financial performance goals set by the LDC Committee at the beginning of the Fiscal 2018 performance period. The LDC Committee bases the payout on achievement of financial metrics to align MIP goals with shareholder value creation and achievement of the Company’s business plan. Performance Goals. Set forth below are the MIP financial performance measures and the threshold, target and maximum Company achievement levels selected by the LDC Committee for Fiscal 2018 (dollars in billions): Fiscal 2018 Performance Measures Measure Weighting Threshold % of Target Goal % of Target Payout Target Maximum % of Target Goal % of Target Payout Sales 40% $102.26 95% 10% $107.64 $129.17 120% 200% Operating Profit 40% $14.02 90% 10% $15.58 $18.69 120% 200% Inventory Turns 20% 4.74 90% 10% 5.27 6.33 120% 200% The operating profit threshold must be met for any MIP payout to occur. The relative weighting among the goals was determined by the LDC Committee with input from the CEO and the EVP-HR to reflect the Company’s priorities for Fiscal 2018 . The LDC Committee aligned the weighting of the sales and operating profit goals to emphasize top line sales growth balanced with the Company’s continued focus on profitability as a means to drive bottom line results for shareholders. Adjustments. The pre-established definitions of sales and operating profit under the MIP provided for adjustments for the impact of acquisitions or dispositions of businesses with annualized sales of $1 billion or more and for nonrecurring charges and write-offs. The definitions also provided for adjustments in excess of $1 billion in the aggregate for sales and in excess of $50 million in the aggregate for operating profit, in connection with specified types of strategic restructuring transactions or changes in tax laws, accounting principles or other laws that materially impact results. The LDC Committee included the adjustment for restructuring transactions because it believes these types of strategic decisions support the long-term best interests of the Company and should not adversely affect incentive opportunities. The adjustment for changes in laws or accounting principles reflects the fact that these changes are outside of the control of the executive officers, and the LDC Committee similarly believes that they should not affect incentive opportunities. As in prior years, the LDC Committee also included in the pre-established definitions of sales and operating profit under the MIP an adjustment to neutralize the impact of any change (positive or negative) in currency exchange rates during the fiscal year. This adjustment reflected the significant volatility in exchange rates and the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, in particular the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso, that has occurred over the last several years. The LDC Committee noted that adjustments for currency fluctuations are not uncommon for large multinational corporations. These fluctuations represent The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 39 Table of Contents external, macro-economic influences outside of the control of the executive officers, and the LDC Committee believes that they should not affect incentive opportunities. Payout Calculations. For achieving the target level of performance for the Fiscal 2018 MIP, executive officers receive 100% payout. The target performance level was consistent with our 2018 business plan and the forecast disclosed at the beginning of Fiscal 2018 . For Fiscal 2018 , the LDC Committee set the threshold performance levels at 95%, 90% and 90% of the performance targets for the sales, operating profit and inventory measures, respectively, with a threshold payout at 10% of target payout. The threshold performance level encourages incremental performance even when achievement of the target appears to be unlikely. At the same time, the relatively low level of payout incentivizes performance above the threshold level. The LDC Committee also sets maximum performance levels to incent participants to achieve and reward them for above-target performance, while at the same time capping payouts to avoid windfalls due to a better than expected external environment. For Fiscal 2018 , the LDC Committee set the payout for maximum achievement for the sales, operating profit and inventory turns measures at 200% of target payout, and set the maximum performance goal for those measures at 120% of the target performance goal. The Company uses interpolation to determine the specific amount of the payout for each NEO with respect to the achievement of financial goals between the various levels. The LDC Committee does not have discretion to increase the MIP payout earned by an NEO, but it may decrease the payout even if the performance goals are achieved. The annual target payout levels are determined as a percentage of base salary: 200% for the CEO; 125% for the CFO; and 100% for the other Executive Vice Presidents. For Messrs. Menear and Carey and Ms. Tomé, payouts for achievement of the performance goals were based on overall Company performance. For Messrs. Holifield and Decker, payouts were based upon performance of the portion of the Company’s business for which they were accountable. The specific performance levels for the portions of the Company’s business for which Messrs. Holifield and Decker were responsible are not material to an understanding of the Company’s compensation program, and we do not believe disclosure of this information would be meaningful to shareholders since it would not be apparent how this information correlates to our consolidated financial statements. Fiscal 2018 MIP Results. For Fiscal 2018 , for purposes of determining the achievement of MIP awards, sales were $ 108.31 billion, operating profit was $ 15.55 billion and inventory turns were 5.08 times, exceeding the target level for the sales goal, while falling below target but above the threshold for the operating profit and inventory turns goals. Pursuant to the pre-established definition of sales under the MIP, sales were adjusted up by $ 106.3 million for the impact of changes in currency exchange rates in Fiscal 2018 . Pursuant to the pre-established definition of operating profit under the MIP, operating profit was adjusted up by $ 18.0 million due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates in Fiscal 2018 . Actual sales and operating profit without these adjustments were $108.2 billion and $15.53 billion, respectively, which also exceeded the target level for the sales goal but fell slightly below target for the operating profit goal. Based on performance in Fiscal 2018 against the performance goals, the following were the target and actual MIP awards for Fiscal 2018 for each of the NEOs: At Target Performance At Actual Performance Name % of Base Salary Dollar Amount % of Base Salary Dollar Amount Craig A. Menear 200% $2,600,000 188.2% $2,446,686 Carol B. Tomé 125% $1,425,000 117.6% $1,340,972 Mark Q. Holifield 100% $820,000 100.1% $821,110 Edward P. Decker 100% $810,000 100.1% $811,096 Matthew A. Carey 100% $775,000 94.1% $729,301 40 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Long-Term Incentives For Fiscal 2018 , we awarded the NEOs annual long-term incentives consisting of 50% performance shares, 30% performance-based restricted stock, and 20% stock options. The LDC Committee changed this mix in Fiscal 2017, from a previous mix of one-third of each type of award, to increase the focus on pay for performance and alignment with shareholder interests. The LDC Committee also believed that this mix of equity components provided an appropriate mix of mid- and long-term performance measures and retention incentive, without promoting excessive risk-taking. The total value of the annual equity awards granted in March 2018 was determined by the LDC Committee after considering the value of equity grants of officers with similar responsibilities at peer group companies described under “Benchmarking” in the “Compensation Determination Process” section above and individual performance relating to financial management, leadership, talent management and operational effectiveness, as well as retention risk. For Fiscal 2018 , the annual equity award for our CEO at the target level was 562% of his base salary at the time the awards were granted. For the other NEOs, the target equity value for the annual equity grant ranged from 268% to 329% of base salary. Performance Shares. The Fiscal 2018 - 2020 performance share award provides for the grant of shares of our common stock at the end of a three-year period based on the achievement of average ROIC and operating profit goals over that period, as follows (dollars in billions): Fiscal 2018-2020 Performance Shares Threshold Target Maximum Three-Year Average ROIC 41.2% 45.7% 50.3% Three-Year Average Operating Profit $14.94 $16.60 $18.26 Percent of Target Payout 25% 100% 200% For results between these levels, the number of shares is determined by interpolation. There is no payout for results below the threshold level. Each performance measure is separately determined and equally weighted. ROIC for each year in the performance period is defined as operating profit, net of tax, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the relevant fiscal year. The pre-established definitions of operating profit and ROIC include adjustments for acquisitions and dispositions of businesses with annualized sales of $1 billion or more, certain nonrecurring write-offs or charges, changes in tax laws, accounting principles or other laws or provisions which have an impact on reported results that exceed $50 million in the aggregate during any fiscal year, and changes in foreign exchange rates, similar to the 2018 MIP. In Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 , the LDC Committee also granted performance share awards that were structured similarly to the Fiscal 2018 - 2020 award. The Fiscal 2017 - 2019 and Fiscal 2016 - 2018 awards each provide for the grant of shares of our common stock at the end of the respective three-year period based on the achievement of average ROIC and operating profit goals over that period, as follows (dollars in billions): Fiscal 2017-2019 Performance Shares Threshold Target Maximum Three-Year Average ROIC 32.0% 35.5% 39.1% Three-Year Average Operating Profit $13.50 $15.00 $16.49 Percent of Target Payout 25% 100% 200% Fiscal 2016-2018 Performance Shares Threshold Target Maximum Three-Year Average ROIC 29.5% 32.8% 36.0% Three-Year Average Operating Profit $12.57 $13.97 $15.36 Percent of Target Payout 25% 100% 200% The pre-established definition of operating profit for each year in the performance period is the same as the one used for the MIP for that year. ROIC for each year in the performance period is defined as operating profit (using the same definition as the MIP for that year), net of tax, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the relevant fiscal year. The pre-established definition of ROIC also provides for adjustments during the performance period for the impact of acquisitions or dispositions of businesses with annualized sales of $1 billion or more. The LDC Committee also adjusted the definitions of operating profit and ROIC for purposes of the Fiscal 2017 - 2019 and Fiscal 2016 - 2018 performance share awards to exclude the The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 41 Table of Contents impact of changes in tax laws, accounting principles or other laws or provisions which have an impact on reported results that exceed $50 million in the aggregate during any fiscal year. This change was made to eliminate any windfall to the executive officers resulting from the impacts of 2017 U.S. tax reform. Dividend equivalents accrue on each of the performance share awards (as reinvested shares) and will be paid upon the payout of the award based on the actual number of shares earned. The performance period for the Fiscal 2016 - 2018 performance share awards ended on February 3, 2019 . Over the three-year period, the Company achieved an average ROIC of 34.8% and average operating profit of $14.49 billion, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the awards. As a result, the NEOs earned approximately 150.1% of their Fiscal 2016 - 2018 awards, reflecting performance in excess of the target level for each metric. Pursuant to the pre-established definition of operating profit for the Fiscal 2016 - 2018 awards, operating profit was adjusted up by $96.1 million due to changes in currency exchange rates in Fiscal 2016 , Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018 , and adjusted up by $44.8 million for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017 due to the 2014 data breach. Pursuant to the pre-established definition of ROIC for the Fiscal 2016 - 2018 awards, ROIC was also adjusted by the same amounts for the impact of currency exchange rates and the 2014 data breach, adjusted down by $1.7 billion due to 2017 U.S. tax reform, and adjusted down by $75.0 million for Fiscal 2018 due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard in Fiscal 2018. Average operating profit and ROIC over the three-year period without the adjustments were $14.44 billion and 36.5% , respectively, which also exceeded the target level for each goal. The NEOs earned the following shares under the award, which include reinvested accrued dividends: Name Value at Date of Grant (1) (3/23/2016) Shares Earned at End of Performance Period (2/3/2019) Value at End of Performance Period (2) (2/3/2019) Craig A. Menear $2,433,291 29,768 $5,488,326 Carol B. Tomé $1,208,311 14,782 $2,725,357 Mark Q. Holifield $666,596 8,154 $1,503,353 Edward P. Decker $666,596 8,154 $1,503,353 Matthew A. Carey $716,601 8,766 $1,616,187 (1) Reflects the grant date fair value. (2) Reflects the value based upon the closing stock price of $ 184.37 on February 1, 2019 , the last trading day of Fiscal 2018 . Performance-Based Restricted Stock. In March 2018 , we granted performance-based restricted stock awards that were forfeitable if operating profit was less than 90% of the MIP target for Fiscal 2018 . Dividends on the restricted stock awards are accrued and not paid out unless the performance goal is met. Once the performance goal is met, cash dividends are then paid currently on the shares of restricted stock. The performance goal was met at the end of Fiscal 2018 . As a result, the restricted stock will vest 50% on each of the 30- and 60-month anniversaries of the grant date. Stock Options. In March 2018 , we granted stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock, which is defined as the market closing price on the date of grant. The options vest 25% on each of the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. Option re-pricing is expressly prohibited by our Omnibus Plan without shareholder approval. Deferred Compensation Plans In addition to the FutureBuilder 401(k) Plan (a broad-based tax-qualified plan), we have two nonqualified deferred compensation plans for our management and highly compensated associates, including executive officers: • The Deferred Compensation Plan For Officers (solely funded by the individuals who participate in the plan); and • The Restoration Plan, which provides a Company matching contribution equal to 3.5% of the amount of salary and annual cash incentive earned by a management-level associate in excess of the IRS annual compensation limit for tax-qualified plans, payable in shares of common stock of the Company upon retirement or other employment termination. The plans are designed to permit participants to accumulate income for retirement and other personal financial goals. The Deferred Compensation Plan For Officers and the Restoration Plan are described in the notes to the 42 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table on page 55. Deferred compensation arrangements are common executive programs, and we believe that these arrangements help us in the recruitment and retention of executive talent; however, we do not view nonqualified deferred compensation as a significant element of our compensation programs. None of these plans provides above-market or preferential returns. Perquisites We provide very limited perquisites to our executive officers and do not view them as a significant element of our compensation program. We do not provide tax reimbursements, or “gross-ups,” on perquisites. Our NEOs participate in a death-benefit-only program, under which they are entitled to a $400,000 benefit upon death if they are employed by the Company at that time. In addition, the benefit is continued for life for executive officers with ten years of service with the Company. Currently, all of our NEOs have met this service requirement and are entitled to lifetime death benefit coverage. In Fiscal 2009, we discontinued this benefit for any new executive officers. The Company requests that Mr. Menear travel by Company aircraft, including travel for personal reasons. We also permit non-business use of Company aircraft by other NEOs on a more limited basis. Other Benefits Our NEOs have the option to participate in various employee benefit programs, including medical, dental, disability and life insurance benefit programs. These benefit programs are generally available to all full-time associates. We also provide all associates, including our NEOs, with the opportunity to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions at a 15% discount through our ESPP, a nondiscriminatory, tax-qualified plan. All associates, including our NEOs, are also eligible to participate in our charitable matching gift program through The Home Depot Foundation. MANAGEMENT OF COMPENSATION-RELATED RISK We employ a number of mechanisms to mitigate the chance of our compensation programs encouraging excessive risk-taking, including those described below. Annual Risk Assessment As discussed above under “Mitigating Compensation Risk” on page 37, the LDC Committee undertakes an annual review and risk assessment of our compensation policies and practices. Compensation Recoupment Policy In February 2019, our Board adopted an updated executive compensation clawback policy, which is set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and LDC Committee charter. Pursuant to the clawback policy, to the extent deemed appropriate and as permitted by law, the Board or the LDC Committee will recover from an executive officer any bonus, incentive payment, equity award or other compensation (in whole or in part) awarded to or received by an executive officer if the compensation was based on any financial results or operating metrics that were achieved as a result of that executive officer’s knowing or intentional fraudulent or illegal conduct or if the executive officer engaged in any intentional misconduct that caused the Company material financial or reputational harm. Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines Our Executive Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines require our NEOs to hold shares of common stock with a value equal to the specified multiples of base salary indicated below. This program assists in focusing executives on long-term success and shareholder value. Shares owned outright, restricted stock, and shares acquired pursuant to the ESPP, the FutureBuilder 401(k) Plan and the Restoration Plan, are counted towards this requirement. Unearned performance shares and unexercised stock options are not counted toward this requirement. Newly hired and promoted executives have four years to satisfy the requirements and must hold all shares received upon vesting of equity awards (net of shares withheld to pay taxes) until the requirements are met. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 43 Table of Contents Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines (continued) As of March 8, 2019, all of our NEOs complied with the stock ownership and retention guidelines and held the following multiples of base salary (rounded to the nearest whole multiple): Multiple of Base Salary Name Current Ownership Guideline Craig A. Menear 23x 6x Carol B. Tomé 88x 4x Mark Q. Holifield 7x 4x Edward P. Decker 16x 4x Matthew A. Carey 19x 4x Anti-Hedging Policy In Fiscal 2012, the Company adopted a policy that prohibits all associates, officers and directors from entering into hedging or monetization transactions designed to limit the financial risk of owning Company stock. These include prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, exchange funds and other similar transactions, as well as speculative transactions in derivatives of the Company’s securities, such as puts, calls, options (other than those granted under a Company compensation plan) or other derivatives. Equity Grant Procedures Company-wide equity grants, including equity grants to NEOs, are awarded annually effective as of the date of the March meeting of the LDC Committee, which is generally scheduled at least a year in advance. Throughout the year, equity awards are made to new hires, promoted employees, and, in rare circumstances, as a reward for exceptional performance. In all cases, the effective grant date for these mid-year awards is the date of the next regularly scheduled quarterly LDC Committee meeting. The exercise price of each of our stock option grants is the market closing price on the effective grant date. SEVERANCE AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS We have a limited severance arrangement with Ms. Tomé. When Ms. Tomé’s employment arrangement was adopted in 2001, the severance provisions reflected the terms provided to our other executives at that time and were consistent with the terms provided in the competitive market for executive talent. This severance arrangement is discussed below under “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control—Termination Without Cause or For Good Reason” on page 56. We do not have a severance arrangement with our CEO or any of our other NEOs. We do not have any change in control agreements with our executives. Our standard form of equity award agreement, adopted by the LDC Committee in Fiscal 2013, provides for accelerated vesting if the executive is terminated without cause within 12 months following a change in control. Prior to Fiscal 2013, our equity awards provided for accelerated vesting solely upon a change in control regardless of any termination of employment. The vast majority of these awards have vested in accordance with their terms. In the event the value of any accelerated vesting constitutes an “excess parachute payment,” the executive would be subject to a 20% excise tax on such amount, and the amount would not be tax deductible by the Company. TAX DEDUCTIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally denies a corporate tax deduction for annual compensation exceeding $1 million paid to a company’s NEOs. Prior to enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, this limitation did not generally apply to compensation paid to the chief financial officer or individuals who were no longer NEOs, or to compensation paid based on achievement of pre-established performance goals if certain requirements were met. Our performance shares, performance-based restricted stock and option awards granted prior to Fiscal 2018 were intended to qualify as performance-based compensation to qualify for a tax deduction. The 44 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents LDC Committee reserved the discretion, however, to award compensation that is not exempt from the deduction limits of Section 162(m). The exemption from Section 162(m)’s deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our NEOs, including our CFO, in excess of $1 million in Fiscal 2018 and future years will not be deductible. Certain awards or compensation arrangements granted or entered into prior to November 2, 2017 may still be deductible if they qualify for transition relief applicable to certain compensation arrangements. Despite the LDC Committee’s efforts to structure prior year awards to be exempt from Section 162(m) and therefore not subject to its deduction limits, there can be no assurance that these awards will be fully deductible because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and regulations issued thereunder, including the uncertain scope of the transition relief under the legislation repealing the exemption from the deduction limit under Section 162(m). In addition, the LDC Committee reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with the Company’s performance and business objectives.

In addition, Fiscal 2018 contained 53 weeks, compared to 52 weeks in Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 , so Fiscal 2018 salary amounts include one additional week of pay. (2) Amounts set forth in the Stock Awards and Option Awards columns represent the aggregate grant date fair value of awards granted in Fiscal 2018 , Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The assumptions made in the valuation of the option awards are set forth in Note 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s 2018 Form 10-K. The valuation of performance-based restricted stock and performance share awards and of share equivalents granted under the Restoration Plan is based on the closing stock price on the grant date. (3) Amounts reflect the grant date fair value of performance share and performance-based restricted stock awards granted to the NEOs during Fiscal 2018 , Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 , plus the value of share equivalents under the Restoration Plan in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 , as set forth in the table below. Fiscal 2018 Restoration Plan contributions reflect contributions for two plan years, since the January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2019 allocation dates both fell within Fiscal 2018. No contributions to the Restoration Plan are shown for Fiscal 2016 because the January 31, 2017 allocation date fell within Fiscal 2017 .

For all performance-based awards other than the performance shares granted in Fiscal 2018 , Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 , this value is the same as the value calculated assuming the maximum level of performance under the awards. The value of the performance share awards granted in Fiscal 2018 , Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 as of the grant date, assuming that the maximum level of the performance goals will be achieved, is as follows for each of the NEOs: Value of Performance Shares Assuming Maximum Performance ($) Name Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Craig A.

Carey 2,199,971 2,199,790 1,433,201 (4) Incremental cost of perquisites is based on actual cost to the Company. The incremental cost of personal use of Company aircraft is based on the average direct cost of use per hour, which includes fuel, maintenance, crew travel and lodging expense, landing and parking fees, and engine restoration cost. Any applicable deadhead flights are allocated to the NEOs. No incremental cost for personal use of the Company aircraft was attributed to an NEO where the plane was already traveling to the destination for business reasons. Since our aircraft are used primarily for business travel, we do not include the fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as crew salaries, depreciation, hangar rent and insurance. In addition to the incremental cost of personal aircraft use reported in the All Other Compensation column and in footnote 5 below, we also impute taxable income to the NEOs for any personal aircraft use in accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations. We do not provide tax reimbursements, or “gross-ups,” on these amounts to executive officers. (5) The following identifies the perquisites and other compensation for Fiscal 2018 that are required to be quantified by SEC rules. In addition to personal aircraft use, the Company made matching contributions to charitable organizations on behalf of the NEOs, as shown below. Name Use of Airplane ($) Matching Charitable Contributions ($) Craig A. Menear 41,555 — Carol B. Tomé 40,235 64,992 Mark Q. Holifield — 14,940 Edward P. Decker — 20,850 Matthew A. Carey — 5,000 Other perquisites and personal benefits for Fiscal 2018 were long-term disability insurance premiums, gifts from certain corporate events, tickets for certain sporting events, costs of a personal incentive trip granted in lieu of an executive business retreat for Messrs. Holifield and Decker and Ms. Tomé, and incremental amounts accrued during Fiscal 2018 under the death-benefit-only program. For Fiscal 2018, the accrued amount under the death-benefit-only program for Mr. Carey was $ 60,356 , reflecting the fact that he reached his tenth year of service with the Company in Fiscal 2018 and as a result, the program now provides him with a lifetime benefit. We do not provide tax gross-ups on any of these perquisites or personal benefits. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 47 Table of Contents MATERIAL TERMS OF NEO EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS This section describes employment arrangements in effect for the NEOs during Fiscal 2018 , all of which are “at-will” employment arrangements set forth in the offer letters provided to the NEOs at the time of hire or promotion, as applicable. Because the offer letters reflect at-will employment, they have no set duration and consequently no renewal or extension provisions. The letters are all filed as exhibits to the 2018 Form 10-K. The offer letters state each NEO’s initial base salary and annual MIP target as a percentage of base salary, payout of which is subject to the achievement of pre-established goals. Both the base salary and MIP target are subject to adjustment upon future review by the LDC Committee, or independent members of the Board in the case of Mr. Menear. The Fiscal 2018 base salary and MIP target as a percentage of base salary for each NEO are set forth above in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. In addition, the offer letters provide that the NEOs are eligible to participate in other benefit programs available to salaried associates and/or officers. These benefits include the ESPP, the Deferred Compensation Plan For Officers, the Restoration Plan and the death-benefit-only insurance program. Any provisions in the letters regarding termination of employment are discussed below in the section entitled “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control” beginning on page 56. Mr. Menear’s offer letter states that the Company has requested that he travel, whenever practicable, by Company aircraft, including when traveling for personal reasons. However, to the extent he or his family uses Company aircraft for personal reasons, the Company will not provide a tax gross-up for any imputed compensation. 48 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents FISCAL 2018 GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS The following table sets forth the plan-based awards granted to the NEOs pursuant to Company plans during Fiscal 2018 .

(2) The Fiscal 2018 MIP was based on achievement of pre-established performance goals as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The amount in the “Threshold” column for the 2018 MIP reflects the minimum possible payout based upon assumed achievement of the threshold performance levels as discussed below under “Terms of Plan-Based Awards Granted to the NEOs for Fiscal 2018 —Fiscal 2018 MIP.” (3) Annual equity awards under the Omnibus Plan were approved at the February 22, 2018 meeting of the LDC Committee (or by the independent Board members for the CEO) but were effective as of March 21, 2018 . See discussion under “Equity Grant Procedures” on page 44 in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis above. (4) Amounts represent the grant date fair value of awards granted in Fiscal 2018 computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The assumptions made in the valuation of the option awards are set forth in Note 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as filed with the SEC in the 2018 Form 10-K. The valuation of restricted stock and performance share awards is based on the closing stock price on the grant date. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 49 Table of Contents TERMS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS GRANTED TO NEOS FOR FISCAL 2018 The LDC Committee approved the Fiscal 2018 annual grants of performance shares, performance-based restricted stock and stock options under the Omnibus Plan for the NEOs other than Mr. Menear. Mr. Menear’s awards were approved by the independent members of the Board. Award Type Award Terms Performance Shares For Fiscal 2018, 50% of the annual equity grant provided to the NEOs was in the form of performance shares. The terms and conditions of the awards are described under “Long-Term Incentives” in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis above. Upon termination of employment without cause within 12 months following a change in control, the executive would be entitled to a pro rata portion of performance shares based on actual performance for the portion of the performance period before a change in control, plus a pro rata portion of the target performance shares for the portion of the performance period after a change in control. In the event of death, disability or retirement at or after age 60 with at least five years of continuous service (“retirement”), the executive or his or her estate will be entitled to receive any performance shares ultimately earned, and in the event of death or disability before retirement, a pro rata portion of any shares ultimately earned. Because Mr. Menear, Ms. Tomé and Mr. Holifield have reached age 60 and have more than five years of service, they are “retirement eligible” and their performance share awards are non-forfeitable, although payout, if any, is based on achievement of the performance goals. Dividend equivalents accrue on performance share awards (as reinvested shares) and are paid upon the payout of the award based on the actual number of shares earned. Annual Stock Grants For Fiscal 2018, 30% of the annual equity grant provided to the NEOs was in the form of performance-based restricted stock, which was forfeitable if Fiscal 2018 operating profit was less than 90% of the MIP target for Fiscal 2018. If the performance target is met, as it was for Fiscal 2018, the awards are then subject to time-based vesting. The annual restricted stock grants vest 50% on each of the 30-month and 60-month anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued employment through the vesting date, or, if sooner, upon termination due to death or disability or termination without cause within 12 months following a change in control. In addition, if the performance target is met, the restricted stock becomes non-forfeitable once the executive reaches retirement eligibility but is not transferable before the time-based vesting dates. Because Mr. Menear, Ms. Tomé and Mr. Holifield were retirement eligible at the time the performance condition was met, their awards became non-forfeitable but remain non-transferable until the time-based vesting dates. Dividends on the restricted stock are accrued (as cash dividends) and not paid out to executive officers unless the performance target is met. Once the performance target is met, cash dividends are then paid currently on the shares of restricted stock. Annual Stock Option Grants For Fiscal 2018, 20% of the annual equity grant provided to the NEOs was in the form of nonqualified stock options. The stock option awards vest 25% per year on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued employment through the vesting date, or, if sooner, upon termination due to death or disability or termination without cause within 12 months following a change in control. In addition, the stock option awards become non-forfeitable once the executive becomes retirement eligible but are not exercisable before the time-based vesting dates. Generally, stock options may be exercised, once vested, over the remainder of the ten-year option term, subject to continued employment or meeting the retirement eligibility requirements. Because Mr. Menear, Ms. Tomé and Mr. Holifield are retirement eligible, their option awards are non-forfeitable but are not exercisable until the time-based vesting dates. 50 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Award Type Award Terms Fiscal 2018 MIP Each of the NEOs participated in the Fiscal 2018 MIP, the Company’s annual cash-based incentive plan. The Fiscal 2018 MIP payout was based upon achievement of pre-established financial performance goals, as described under “Elements of Our Compensation Programs—Annual Incentive” in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis on page 39 above. The LDC Committee approved threshold, target and maximum payout levels for Fiscal 2018 for the NEOs under the MIP. The threshold, target and maximum potential payouts under the MIP for the NEOs reflect the following percentages of base salary at the end of Fiscal 2018: Percentage of Base Salary Name Threshold Target Maximum Craig A. Menear 8% 200% 400% Carol B. Tomé 5% 125% 250% Mark Q. Holifield 4% 100% 200% Edward P. Decker 4% 100% 200% Matthew A. Carey 4% 100% 200% Because the operating profit threshold must be met for any payout to occur, the threshold percentage above reflects the minimum possible payout based upon assumed achievement of that threshold. The actual amounts earned based on achievement of Fiscal 2018 MIP performance goals are reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table.

Carey Restoration Plan (5) N/A 90,308 (84,301 ) — 907,763 (1) Executive contributions represent deferral of base salary and incentive awards under the MIP during Fiscal 2018 , which amounts are also disclosed in the Fiscal 2018 Salary column and the Fiscal 2017 Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. The Restoration Plan is non-elective, and the participants cannot make contributions to it. (2) All Company contributions to the Restoration Plan are included as compensation in the Stock Awards column of the Summary Compensation Table. Fiscal 2018 Restoration Plan contributions reflect contributions for two plan years, since the January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2019 allocation dates both fell within Fiscal 2018.The Company does not make contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan For Officers. (3) Deferred Compensation Plan For Officers earnings represent notional returns on participant-selected investments. Restoration Plan earnings represent the change in the value of the underlying Company stock during Fiscal 2018 plus dividends that are credited at the same rate, and at the same time, that dividends are paid to all shareholders. (4) For the Restoration Plan, amounts in the aggregate balance for Mr. Menear, Ms. Tomé, Mr. Holifield, Mr. Decker and Mr. Carey of $514,881 , $933,435 , $132,795 , $47,811 and $280,113 , respectively, were previously reported in the Summary Compensation Table. For the Deferred Compensation Plan For Officers, $3,301,723 of the aggregate balance amount for Mr. Menear was previously reported in the Summary Compensation Table. (5) The Restoration Plan, an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan, provides management-level associates with a benefit equal to the matching contributions that they would have received under the Company’s FutureBuilder 401(k) Plan if certain Internal Revenue Code limitations were not in place. On January 31 of each year, the plan makes an allocation to participant accounts in an amount equal to the participant’s eligible earnings (generally, salary plus annual cash incentive award) during the prior calendar year minus the Internal Revenue Code limit for tax-qualified plans ($275,000 for 2018 ) multiplied by the current Company match level of 3.5%. This amount is then converted to units representing shares of the Company’s common stock. Stock units credited to a participant’s account are also credited with dividend equivalents at the same time, and in the same amount, as dividends are paid to shareholders. Participant account balances vest at the same time their account in the Company’s tax-qualified FutureBuilder 401(k) Plan vests, which provides for 100% cliff vesting after three years of service. A participant’s vested account balance is payable in shares of common stock on retirement or other employment termination. In-service withdrawals are not permitted. (6) The Deferred Compensation Plan For Officers is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows officers to defer payment of up to 50% of base salary and up to 100% of annual incentive compensation until retirement or other employment termination. The Company makes no contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan For Officers. Participants may also elect an in-service distribution during a designated calendar year or over a period of not more than ten years, or upon a change in control of the Company. Commencing at retirement after age 60 or one year thereafter, payment is made, at the participant’s election, in a single sum or equal annual installment payments over a period of not more than ten years, provided that distribution in a single sum is automatically made on termination for reasons other than retirement or disability. Participants direct the manner in which their account balances are deemed invested among an array of investment funds, and notional earnings are credited to participant accounts based on fund returns. Accounts are 100% vested at all times. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 55 Table of Contents POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL Termination Without Cause or For Good Reason The employment arrangements with Messrs. Menear, Holifield, Decker, and Carey do not entitle them to any severance payments upon employment termination. They would, however, be entitled to any vested benefits under Company plans in which they participate. Messrs. Menear, Holifield, Decker, and Carey are subject to non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions for 24 months and 36 months post-termination, respectively. Each NEO is also subject to post-termination confidentiality restrictions. The following table sets forth the estimated value of benefits that Ms. Tomé would be entitled to receive, assuming a termination of employment by the Company without cause or by Ms. Tomé for good reason as of February 3, 2019 , the last day of Fiscal 2018 . She would also be entitled to any vested benefits under Company plans in which she participates, including amounts under the Restoration Plan as set forth in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table on page 55 of this Proxy Statement. Ms. Tomé is not entitled to payment of any benefits upon termination for cause or resignation without good reason other than for accrued compensation earned prior to employment termination and any vested benefits under Company plans in which she participates.

Tomé 2,280,000 8,861,547 11,141,547 Under Ms. Tomé’s employment arrangement, pursuant to provisions that were adopted in 2001, in the event her employment is terminated by the Company without cause, or by Ms. Tomé for good reason, the Company would continue to pay her base salary for 24 months in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll practices, subject to any delay necessary to comply with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Also, vesting would be accelerated on her outstanding restricted stock and stock option awards that would otherwise have vested during the salary continuation period ( 106,092 options with an intrinsic value of $ 6,701,837 and 11,714 shares of restricted stock with a value of $ 2,159,710 at the end of Fiscal 2018 , based upon the closing stock price of $ 184.37 on February 1, 2019 ). Because Ms. Tomé is retirement eligible, any remaining unvested equity at the end of the salary continuation period would be non-forfeitable, but would continue to be subject to time-based and/or performance-based vesting requirements, as described below under “—Termination Due to Retirement” on page 59. Termination for cause by the Company under this arrangement generally means that the executive: (a) has engaged in conduct that constitutes willful gross neglect or willful gross misconduct with respect to employment duties that results in material economic harm to the Company, (b) has been convicted of a felony involving theft or moral turpitude, or (c) has violated Company policies. Termination of employment for good reason by the executive generally means the occurrence of certain events without the executive’s consent, including: (a) the assignment to a principal office outside of the Atlanta metropolitan area, (b) decrease in base salary or failure to pay the agreed-upon compensation, or (c) cessation of a direct reporting relationship to the CEO. In exchange for the foregoing severance payments, Ms. Tomé agreed that during the term of her employment and for 24 months thereafter, she will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, be employed by or otherwise participate in the management of competitors of the Company. She also agreed not to solicit any employee of the Company to accept a position with another entity during the 36-month period following termination. 56 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Change in Control The Company does not maintain change in control agreements for its executives. Our standard form of equity award agreement, adopted by the LDC Committee in Fiscal 2013, provides for accelerated vesting if the executive is terminated without cause within 12 months following a change in control. Prior to Fiscal 2013, our equity awards provided for accelerated vesting solely upon a change in control regardless of any termination of employment. The vast majority of these awards have vested in accordance with their terms. The following table sets forth the estimated value that the NEOs would be entitled to receive due to accelerated vesting of outstanding awards assuming a change in control of the Company as of February 3, 2019 , both with and without a termination of employment. In addition, in the event of a termination of employment, the NEOs would be entitled to receive vested benefits under Company plans in which they participate, including amounts under the Restoration Plan and, if applicable, the Deferred Compensation Plan For Officers, as set forth in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table on page 55 of this Proxy Statement .

Due to the outstanding performance of our non-management associates in Fiscal 2018 , we made substantial payouts under our Success Sharing program, with 100% of stores receiving Success Sharing in each of the first and second halves of Fiscal 2018 . This resulted in total Success Sharing bonus payments to our non-management associates of approximately $222 million for Fiscal 2018 performance. We also paid a one-time bonus of up to $1,000 to our U.S. hourly associates in light of the benefit we expected to receive from U.S. tax reform adopted in late 2017. In addition, we established a merit increase budget for our associates in Fiscal 2018 of between 2.5% and 3%, and we continued our practice of making matching contributions under the FutureBuilder 401(k) Plan. We also provided a variety of recognition and teambuilding awards to recognize and reward top-performing associates and support morale. As part of our strategic investments, we also made a number of specific investments in our associates in Fiscal 2018 , including elimination of the waiting period for benefits, such as health insurance, for new hires and enhanced paid maternity and parental leave benefits. The following ratio compares the annual total compensation of our median-paid (or middle) associate (the “median-paid associate”) with the annual total compensation of Craig Menear, our CEO. The pay ratio included below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (the “pay ratio rule”). • The annual total compensation of our median-paid associate, other than our CEO, was $23,389 . Our median-paid associate for Fiscal 2018 was an hourly employee in the U.S. • The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 46, was $11,366,662 . • Based on this information, for Fiscal 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median-paid associate was 486 to 1. For purposes of the above disclosure, we are required to identify our median-paid associate based upon our total workforce, without regard to their location, compensation arrangements, or full-time, part-time or seasonal status. To identify the median-paid associate, we used the following methodology, material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates: • We determined our median-paid associate as of December 31, 2018 , which is within the last three months of Fiscal 2018 , as required by the pay ratio rule. • We excluded, under the de minimis exception to the pay ratio rule, all of our associates in each of Mexico (approximately 15,970 ), China (approximately 212 ), India (approximately 12 ), Vietnam (approximately 6 ), Italy ( 1 ), Poland ( 1 ), and Turkey ( 1 ), which in total are approximately 16,203 associates out of a total of approximately 413,400 associates, or 3.9% . • To identify our median-paid associate, we used payroll data consisting of salary, wages, overtime wages, bonuses, commissions, employer matching contributions to our FutureBuilder 401(k) plan, vesting of equity awards and any similar payroll items for all of our associates included in the calculation. We annualized pay for newly hired associates and associates on leave. We pay our Canadian associates in Canadian Dollars. For the purposes of this calculation, their pay was converted into U.S. Dollars using the rate in effect on December 31, 2018 . Once we identified our median-paid associate, we determined that associate’s annual total compensation for Fiscal 2018 , which ended February 3, 2019 . This amount, consistent with the compensation of our CEO, includes annual incentive compensation earned in Fiscal 2018 and paid in March 2019 , but does not include the one-time bonus for U.S. hourly associates that we announced in January 2018. 60 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION The following table sets forth information regarding the Company’s equity compensation plans as of the end of Fiscal 2018 .

The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 61 Table of Contents D IRECTOR C OMPENSATION Our philosophy with respect to director compensation is to align the interests of non-employee directors with the interests of our shareholders. To implement this philosophy, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the annual retainer for non-employee directors must be at least two-thirds equity. The Company presently provides 82% of each director’s annual retainer in Company equity. Furthermore, consistent with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, director equity awards stipulate that shares of Company stock must continue to be held until the director retires from the Board or for one year after Board service ends for any reason other than ordinary Board retirement (at or after age 72), death, disability or a change in control of the Company. Non-employee director compensation is assessed each year by the LDC Committee, based on input from its independent compensation consultant and taking into account compensation paid to non-employee directors at the companies in the same peer group used for executive compensation purposes, as described above in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under “Compensation Determination Process—Benchmarking” beginning on page 36. For compensation to be paid in Fiscal 2018 , this assessment took place in August 2017 . Based on this assessment, the LDC Committee did not recommend any changes to non-employee director compensation for Fiscal 2018 . Each non-employee director who was a Board member during Fiscal 2018 received an annual retainer of $280,000 as of the date of the 2018 annual meeting, other than Karen Katen, who stepped down from the Board at the end of her term at the 2018 annual meeting. The annual retainer was paid in the following manner: • $230,000 in the form of deferred shares granted under the Omnibus Plan; and • $50,000 in the form of cash or deferred stock units under the Directors Plan, at the election of the director. The deferred shares and deferred stock units, together with dividend equivalents that accrue thereon, are payable in shares of the Company’s common stock following termination of Board service. Director compensation is paid for the twelve-month period commencing with each annual meeting of shareholders. A pro rata portion of annual director compensation is paid to directors who become Board members after the annual meeting as follows: 100% for appointments on or before the six-month anniversary of the annual meeting, 50% after the six-month but not later than the nine-month anniversary of the annual meeting, and 25% after the nine-month anniversary of the annual meeting. For Fiscal 2018 , on the date of the 2018 annual meeting the non-employee directors who served as Chairs of the Board committees also received the following amounts: Committee Chair Retainer Amount Audit $25,000 Finance $15,000 Leadership Development and Compensation $20,000 Nominating and Corporate Governance $15,000 Board committee Chair retainers were payable in cash or deferred stock units under the Directors Plan, at the election of the director. The Lead Director also receives an additional retainer of $80,000 in the form of cash or, at his election, deferred stock units under the Directors Plan. To meet the two-thirds equity requirement in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Lead Director must elect to receive at least 7.7% of the aggregate of his cash retainers in the form of deferred stock units under the Directors Plan, with the remainder paid in the form of cash or deferred stock units under the Directors Plan, at the election of the Lead Director. For Fiscal 2018 , our Lead Director elected to receive 100% of his cash retainers in deferred stock units under the Directors Plan. The Company also pays (or provides for reimbursement of) the travel and accommodation expenses of directors and, when requested by the Company, their spouses, to attend Board meetings, conduct store visits and participate in other corporate functions. The Company maintains a program through which it will match up to $10,000 of charitable donations made by each director, including the Chairman, for each calendar year. In addition, the Company will match up to $5,000 62 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents of any non-employee director’s contribution to the Company’s political action committee with a donation to a charitable organization of the director’s choice. The directors do not receive any financial benefit from these programs because the charitable deductions, to the extent permitted, accrue solely to the Company. Donations under the programs are not made to any charity from which the director (or a party related to the director) directly or indirectly receives compensation. The following table sets forth the compensation paid to or earned during Fiscal 2018 by our non-employee directors who served during Fiscal 2018 .

Messrs. Bousbib, Brown, Carey and Codina also deferred 100% of their committee Chair retainers, and Mr. Brenneman deferred 100% of his Lead Director retainer.

The Board recommends that you vote “For” each of the director nominees, the ratification of KPMG, and Say-on-Pay. The Board recommends that you vote “Against” each of the shareholder proposals. WHO IS ENTITLED TO VOTE? Holders of record of shares of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on March 25, 2019 , the record date for the Meeting, are entitled to vote. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter presented for a vote of the shareholders. As of March 25, 2019 , we had 1,102,741,307 shares of common stock outstanding. HOW MANY SHARES MUST BE PRESENT TO HOLD THE MEETING? In order for us to conduct the Meeting, holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock as of the close of business on March 25, 2019 must be present in person or by proxy. This is referred to as a quorum. Your shares are counted as present if you attend the Meeting and properly vote in person or if you properly return a proxy or voting instruction form over the Internet, by telephone or by mail as explained in more detail below. Abstentions and broker non-votes (as defined below) will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum but will not affect the outcome of the vote on any proposal. If a quorum is not present at the Meeting, the Meeting may be adjourned from time to time until a quorum is present. HOW CAN I ATTEND THE MEETING? To attend the Meeting, you will need to bring: • Valid picture identification; and • An admission ticket if your shares are registered in your name or a legal proxy from the bank or broker that is the record owner of your shares. If your shares are registered in your name and you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, the Notice is your admission ticket. If your shares are registered in your name and you received proxy materials by mail, your admission ticket is attached to your proxy card. If you hold shares through an account with a bank or broker, you will need to contact your bank or broker and request a legal proxy. A legal proxy is an authorization from your bank or broker for you to vote the shares it holds in its name on your behalf. It also serves as your admission ticket. Be sure to bring your admission ticket if you will be attending the Meeting. If you do not have valid picture identification and an appropriate form of admission ticket, you will not be admitted to the Meeting. You may indicate whether you plan to attend the Meeting by checking the appropriate box if completing a proxy card or the voting instruction form provided by your bank or broker, responding when prompted if voting by telephone, or making the appropriate selection at the bottom of the screen after entering your control number at www.proxyvote.com if voting over the Internet. 68 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents WHO IS SOLICITING MY VOTE? The Company is providing this Proxy Statement in connection with the solicitation by the Board of proxies to be voted at the Meeting and at any reconvened or rescheduled meeting following any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting. HOW DO I VOTE BEFORE THE MEETING? If you are a registered shareholder, which means you hold your shares in certificate form or through an account with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you have three options for voting before the Meeting: • Over the Internet, at www.proxyvote.com, by following the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card; • By telephone, by dialing 1-800-690-6903; or • By completing, dating, signing and returning a proxy card by mail. If your valid proxy card is received by Internet, telephone or mail, your shares will be voted at the Meeting in accordance with your instructions. If you are a beneficial holder, meaning you hold your shares in “street name” through an account with a bank or broker, your ability to vote over the Internet or by telephone depends on the voting procedures of your bank or broker. Please follow the directions on the voting instruction form that your bank or broker provides. MAY I VOTE AT THE MEETING? Yes. If you are a registered shareholder, you may vote your shares at the Meeting if you attend in person. If you hold your shares through an account with a bank or broker, you must obtain and present a legal proxy from the bank or broker in order to vote at the Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Meeting, we encourage you to vote your shares before the Meeting. MAY I REVOKE MY PROXY AND/OR CHANGE MY VOTE? Yes. You may revoke your proxy and/or change your vote by: • Signing another proxy card with a later date and delivering it to us before the Meeting; • Voting again over the Internet or by telephone prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 22, 2019 ; • Voting at the Meeting before the polls close if you are a registered shareholder or have obtained a legal proxy from your bank or broker; or • Notifying the Company’s Corporate Secretary in writing before the Meeting that you revoke your proxy. HOW DO I VOTE IF I PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THE COMPANY’S RETIREMENT PLANS? You may vote your shares over the Internet, by telephone, by mail or in person at the Meeting as if you are a registered shareholder, as described in this Proxy Statement. By voting, you are instructing the trustee of your plan to vote all of your shares as directed. If you do not vote, the shares credited to your account will be voted by the trustee in the same proportion that it votes shares in other accounts for which it received timely instructions. If, however, you hold shares through the self-directed brokerage window of your plan or you participate in one of the Company’s Canada-based retirement plans and, in either case, you do not vote those shares, those shares will not be voted. WHAT IF I SIGN AND RETURN MY PROXY BUT DO NOT PROVIDE VOTING INSTRUCTIONS? Proxies that are signed, dated and returned but do not contain voting instructions will be voted: • “For” the election of all of the 12 named director nominees; • “For” the ratification of the appointment of KPMG; • “For” the advisory Say-on-Pay vote; • “Against” each shareholder proposal; and • On any other matters properly brought before the Meeting, in accordance with the best judgment of the named proxies. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 69 Table of Contents WILL MY SHARES BE VOTED IF I DO NOT PROVIDE A PROXY OR VOTING INSTRUCTION FORM? If you are a registered shareholder and do not provide a proxy by voting over the Internet, by telephone or by signing and returning a proxy card, you must attend the Meeting in order to vote. If you hold shares through an account with a bank or broker, the voting of the shares by the bank or broker when you do not provide voting instructions is governed by the rules of the NYSE. These rules allow banks and brokers to vote shares in their discretion on “routine” matters for which their customers do not provide voting instructions. On matters considered “non-routine,” banks and brokers may not vote shares without your instruction. Shares that banks and brokers are not authorized to vote are referred to as “broker non-votes.” The ratification of KPMG as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2019 is considered a routine matter. Accordingly, banks and brokers may vote shares on this proposal without your instructions, and there will be no broker non-votes with respect to this proposal. The other proposals will be considered non-routine, and banks and brokers therefore cannot vote shares on those proposals without your instructions. Please note that if you want your vote to be counted on those proposals, including the election of directors, you must instruct your bank or broker how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, no votes will be cast on your behalf with respect to those proposals. HOW MANY VOTES ARE NEEDED TO APPROVE THE PROPOSALS? The following table provides information about the votes needed to approve each proposal. A “majority of votes cast” means the number of “For” votes exceeds the number of “Against” votes. Items of Business Board Recommendation Voting Approval Standard Effect of Abstention Effect of Broker Non-Vote 1. Election of 12 directors For each director nominee Majority of votes cast None None 2. Ratification of KPMG For Majority of votes cast None Not applicable 3. Say-on-Pay For Majority of votes cast None None 4-6. Shareholder proposals Against each proposal Majority of votes cast None None • Election of Directors :  Each director nominee receiving a majority of votes cast will be elected as a director. If any incumbent director nominee does not receive a majority of votes cast, under Delaware law he or she would continue to serve on the Board until a successor is elected. However, our By-Laws provide that any incumbent director who fails to receive a majority of votes cast must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board for consideration. The NCG Committee will then recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation or to take any other action. The Board will act on that recommendation and publicly disclose its decision within 90 days following certification of election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the NCG Committee’s recommendation or in the Board’s decision. • Say-on-Pay :  While this proposal is advisory in nature and not binding on the Company, our LDC Committee and Board will consider the voting results in formulating future executive compensation policy. WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE NOTICE, PROXY CARD OR VOTING INSTRUCTION FORM? This means that your shares are registered in different names or are held in more than one account. To ensure that all shares are voted, please vote each account over the Internet or by telephone, or sign and return by mail all proxy cards and voting instruction forms. We encourage you to register all shares in the same name and address by contacting our transfer agent, Computershare, at 1-800-577-0177. If you hold your shares through an account with a bank or broker, you should contact your bank or broker and request consolidation. WHY DID SOME SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVE A NOTICE WHILE OTHERS RECEIVED A PRINTED SET OF PROXY MATERIALS? We are allowed to furnish our proxy materials to requesting shareholders over the Internet, rather than by mailing printed copies, so long as we send them a “Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.” The Notice tells shareholders how to access and review the Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report online and how to vote over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com. Using this method of proxy delivery expedites the receipt of proxy materials by our shareholders, reduces the cost of printing and mailing the full set of proxy materials, and helps 70 The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement Table of Contents us contribute to sustainable practices. If you receive the Notice and would like to receive printed proxy materials, follow the instructions in the Notice. If you receive printed proxy materials, you will not receive the Notice, but you may still access our proxy materials and submit your proxy over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com. AVAILABILITY OF ANNUAL REPORT AND PROXY STATEMENT TO SHAREHOLDERS Only one copy of the Notice or this Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report is being delivered to shareholders sharing an address unless the Company has received contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders at that address. Shareholders sharing an address who wish to receive separate copies of the Notice or this Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report, or who wish to begin receiving a single copy of such materials, may make such request as follows: • If you are a registered shareholder, by writing to Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc., Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717 or by calling 1-866-540-7095; or • If you are a beneficial owner, by contacting your broker, dealer, bank, voting trustee or other nominee. Registered shareholders sharing an address who elect to receive a single copy of the Notice or this Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report will continue to receive separate proxy cards. You may also elect to receive the Notice or this Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report via e-mail by contacting Broadridge if you are a registered shareholder, by contacting your bank or broker if you are a beneficial owner, or by visiting our Investor Relations website at http://ir.homedepot.com under “Shareholder Services > Electronic Delivery of Proxy Materials.” Additional copies of this Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report will be provided without charge to shareholders upon written request to Investor Relations, The Home Depot, Inc., 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339, or by calling (770) 384-2871. Copies may also be obtained via the Internet at http://ir.homedepot.com under “Financial Reports.” WILL YOU MAKE A LIST OF SHAREHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE AT THE MEETING AVAILABLE? We will make available a list of shareholders of record as of the record date for inspection by shareholders for any purpose germane to the Meeting during normal business hours from May 13 through May 23, 2019 at the principal office of the Company at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. This list also will be available to shareholders for any such purpose at the Meeting. WHERE AND WHEN WILL I BE ABLE TO FIND THE VOTING RESULTS? You can find the official results of the voting at the Meeting in our Current Report on Form 8-K that we will file with the SEC within four business days after the Meeting. If the official results are not available at that time, we will provide preliminary voting results in the Form 8-K and will provide the final results in an amendment to the Form 8-K as soon as they become available. The Home Depot 2019 Proxy Statement 71 Table of Contents G ENERAL SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE Based on a review of reports required to be filed with the SEC and NYSE and furnished to the Company during Fiscal 2018 by directors, officers and beneficial owners of more than ten percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, and a review of written certifications provided by them to the Company, we believe that our directors and executive officers timely complied with the requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during Fiscal 2018 .
