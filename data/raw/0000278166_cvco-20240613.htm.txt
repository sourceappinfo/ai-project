On behalf of the entire Board, Cavco thanks you for your continued support and interest in the Company. Your investment in Cavco has been instrumental in driving the Company’s success. As your Board, we support the management team in achieving sustainable stockholder value by executing against a clear and focused strategy supported by prudent risk management, sound corporate governance, an executive compensation program aligned with the interests of our stockholders, and a focused approach to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) leadership and engagement. The Board would like to highlight a few areas of particular significance for the Company this past fiscal year: • Revenue and Net Income: The Company achieved the second highest revenue total in the history of the Company and the third highest amount of net income. • Profitability: The Company’s focus on operational efficiency and cost optimization resulted in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue of 23.8%. • Health and Safety: Cavco has invested in its employees with training and workforce development programs that focus on safety first. As a result, the Company’s OSHA total recordable incident frequency rate for the calendar year dropped by 33% from the year prior even while adding four new manufacturing facilities to our system. As the Company moves forward, we remain focused on our long-term strategic objectives and our commitment to sustainable growth. We recognize the challenges that lie ahead, including evolving market and financial dynamics. However, the Company is confident in its ability to navigate these obstacles and capitalize on opportunities.

Only stockholders that owned our common stock at the close of business on that date are entitled to notice of our Annual Meeting and may vote on the proposals presented at it or any adjournment of the meeting.

The Proxy and our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on May 24, 2024 (the "Annual Report") can be accessed directly on our investor relations website at investor.cavco.com/annualmeeting , or at www.ProxyVote.com , where you will need your 16 digit control number found on your Notice or Proxy Card to access the materials. YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT! YOU ARE URGED TO VOTE YOUR PROXY PROMPTLY BY MAIL, TELEPHONE, OR VIA THE INTERNET, WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE ANNUAL MEETING. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 1 Cavco Industries, Inc. 2024 Proxy Statement ABOUT OUR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS Commonly Asked Questions and Answers Why did I receive these materials? You received these Proxy materials because the Board is soliciting your proxy to vote at our 2024 Annual Meeting on July 30, 2024 (or at any postponement or adjournment of the meeting). You were a stockholder of Cavco as of June 3, 2024, the Record Date. Therefore, you are entitled to receive notice of the meeting and to vote on the matters presented at the Annual Meeting. You should review this Proxy Statement carefully as it gives important information about the proposals that will be voted on at the Annual Meeting, as well as other important information about Cavco. Why did I receive a Notice instead of a full set of proxy materials? The SEC allows Cavco to make these Proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report available electronically via the internet at our website investor.cavco.com/annualmeeting or www.ProxyVote.com . On or about June 13, 2024, Cavco mailed to its stockholders a Proxy Card or a Notice containing instructions for accessing this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report over the internet. If you received the Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail unless you request them. If you would like a printed copy of Cavco’s Proxy materials, please follow the instructions for requesting printed materials in the Notice. Can I access the Proxy materials electronically? Yes. Your Notice or Proxy Card contain instructions on how to view our Proxy materials for the Annual Meeting online and how to instruct us to send our future proxy materials to you electronically by email. Our Proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement, are also available on our website at investor.cavco.com/annualmeeting or at www.ProxyVote.com , where you will need your 16 digit control number, provided in your Notice and Proxy Card. Proxy materials will be available during the voting period starting on June 13, 2024. Instead of receiving future copies of our proxy statements and annual reports by mail, stockholders of record and most beneficial owners can elect to receive an email that will provide an electronic link to these documents. Your election to receive future proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you revoke it. Please note that only one Notice will be sent to stockholders who are listed at the same address. Who can vote on proposals presented at the Annual Meeting? Stockholders who own shares of our common stock as of the close of business on the Record Date, June 3, 2024, are entitled to vote on proposals presented at the 2024 Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, we had approximately 8,275,751 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Each stockholder will be entitled to one vote per share on the election of Directors and each other matter that is described in this Proxy Statement or that may be properly brought before the meeting. How do I cast my vote? Most of Cavco’s stockholders hold their shares through a broker, bank, or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between these shares owned by beneficial stockholders and shares owned by registered stockholders: Beneficial Stockholders . If your shares are held in a brokerage account, bank, or by another nominee, you are with respect to those shares the “beneficial stockholder” of shares held in street name. As the beneficial stockholder, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, or other nominee on how to vote those shares at the Annual Meeting. You must follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank, or other nominee in order to instruct them on how to vote your shares. Beneficial stockholders should generally be able to vote by returning the voting instruction card to their broker, bank, or other nominee, or by telephone or via internet. However, the availability of telephone or internet voting will depend on the voting process of your broker, bank, or other nominee. Since you are not a stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your broker, bank, or other nominee (who is the stockholder of record) giving you the right to vote the shares. 2 2024 Proxy Statement Cavco Industries, Inc. 2024 Proxy Statement Registered Stockholders . If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the Company or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, for registered stockholders there are four ways to vote: 1. by internet at www.ProxyVote.com , 24 hours a day, seven days a week (have your Proxy Card or Notice in hand when you visit the website and follow the instructions to obtain your records and to create an electronic voting instruction form) prior to 11:59 p.m. EDT on July 29, 2024; 2. by toll-free telephone at 1-800-690-6903 (have your Proxy Card or Notice in hand when you call); 3. by completing and mailing your Proxy Card (if you received printed Proxy materials); or 4. by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person during the meeting. To be admitted to the Annual Meeting and vote your shares you will need to have your voting card with you. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also vote by proxy so that your vote will be counted if you decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. Who can attend the Annual Meeting? All stockholders as of the close of business on the Record Date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the Annual Meeting that will be held in person on July 30, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. (local time) at our corporate headquarters located at 3636 N. Central Avenue, Suite 1200, Phoenix, Arizona 85012. What is a “Broker Non-Vote”? Generally, a broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank, or other nominee that holds shares in street name for a customer is precluded from exercising voting discretion on a particular proposal because the: (i) beneficial owner has not provided instructions on how to vote; and (ii) such broker, bank, or other nominee lacks discretionary voting power to vote on such issues. Accordingly, a broker, bank, or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to the approval of “non-routine” matters absent specific voting instructions from the beneficial owners of such shares. What Constitutes a Quorum for the Annual Meeting? The holders of a majority of shares entitled to vote on June 3, 2024, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Cavco will count abstentions and broker non-votes as present for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. In the event the requisite votes for approval of the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting are not received prior to the Annual Meeting date, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Annual Meeting in order to solicit additional votes. The form of proxy being solicited by this Proxy Statement provides the authority for the proxy holders, in their discretion, to vote the stockholders’ shares with respect to a postponement or adjournment of the Annual Meeting. At any postponed or adjourned meeting, proxies received pursuant to this Proxy Statement will be voted in the same manner described in this Proxy Statement with respect to the original meeting. What will I be voting on at the Annual Meeting and what is required to approve each item? Proposal No. 1 (Election of Directors): In order to be elected as a Director, a nominee must receive an affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast with respect to that Director nominee’s election, which means the number of votes cast “FOR” a Director nominee’s election must exceed the number of votes cast “AGAINST” that Director nominee’s election. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not treated as votes cast and will have no effect on Proposal No. 1. Proposal No. 2 ( Advisory Vote on the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers ) : The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and represented by person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting is required for advisory approval. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against Proposal No. 2. Broker non-votes will not be treated as entitled to vote on the proposal and will have no effect on Proposal No. 2. Proposal No. 3 ( Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ): The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast for the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm is required for approval. Abstentions are not treated as votes cast and will have no effect on Proposal No. 3. We do not expect there to be any broker non-votes for this proposal because brokers, banks, or other nominees that hold shares in street name may exercise discretionary voting authority for this proposal. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 3 Cavco Industries, Inc. 2024 Proxy Statement Will there be other items to be voted on at the Annual Meeting? Cavco is not aware of any other matters that may come before the Board at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, your proxy authorizes the individuals named as proxies to vote, or otherwise act, in accordance with their discretion. How will proxies be voted at the Annual Meeting? Beneficial Stockholders . If you hold your shares in "street name", the record holder does not have discretionary voting power with respect to non-routine matters absent specific voting instructions from you. Other than the proposal to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, all of the proposals at this year’s Annual Meeting are considered non-routine matters.

Our Board meets on a regular basis throughout the year and additionally as required. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and pursuant to the requirements of the SEC, Nasdaq, and the State of Delaware, our Board is made up of a majority of independent Directors selected on the basis of their integrity, experience, achievements, judgment, intelligence, personal character, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, willingness to devote adequate time to Board duties, and likelihood that he or she will be able to serve on the Board for a sustained period, giving due consideration to diversity in perspectives, backgrounds, business experiences, professional expertise, and personal backgrounds. Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that our Board shall not have fewer than one director nor more than fifteen.

Board Leadership Structure The Board has adopted a policy separating the position of the Chair of the Board from the position of President and CEO in order to enhance the independence of the Board. The Board’s Role in Risk Oversight The Board oversees the Company’s risk profile and management’s processes for assessing and managing risks associated with our business operations and strategies. Management is responsible for the assessment and management of the Company’s risks which include the creation of appropriate risk management policies and procedures. Further, management informs the Board of the Company’s most significant risks and the proposed strategies for managing those risks. The Board also provides oversight of risk through its four standing committees: • The Audit Committee reports to the Board regarding the adequacy of our risk management processes related to financial exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such financial risks. To assist the Audit Committee in overseeing risk management, the Company’s Director of Internal Audit meets regularly with the Audit Committee, including meeting with it in executive session on a quarterly basis. Our Internal Audit team provides the Audit Committee with an assessment of the Company’s financial risks, internal controls and a summary of all completed internal audits. • The Legal and Compliance Oversight Committee reports to the Board and oversees the development and implementation of the Company's legal and compliance related programs, including Cavco's data security program. The General Counsel & Chief Compliance Officer meets regularly with the Legal and Compliance Oversight Committee and updates it quarterly on the legal and compliance programs, processes, and regulatory matters impacting the Company. • The Compensation Committee oversees the design of the executive compensation program to ensure it aligns with stockholder interests. The Compensation Committee recommends to the Board compensation arrangements between the Company and our executive officers and approves all grants of equity to employees and Directors. • The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee oversees and advises the Board and management on the Company’s governance practices, including the Board’s selection of directors, the annual self-evaluation of the Board, and the development and maintenance of the Company's corporate governance guidelines. • The Board expects management to promote a corporate culture that incorporates risk management into our corporate strategy and day-to-day operations. The Board oversees management’s assessment and management of likely areas of material risk. 12 2024 Proxy Statement Director Nominating Process Selection of Directors The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing the process of nominating individuals to stand for election as Directors.

Diversity In connection with the selection of nominees for Director, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee gives due consideration to diversity in perspectives, backgrounds, business experiences, and professional expertise among the Board members and Director nominees. Nominations by Stockholders Our Bylaws specify the manner stockholders may make nominations for the election of Directors. Under the Bylaws, in order to bring a proposal before a meeting of stockholders, including the nomination of directors, a stockholder must deliver proper notice. The procedures for such notice are set forth below under "Additional Information-Stockholder Director Nominations and Stockholder Proposals for the 2025 Annual Meeting". Majority Vote Policy for Director Elections The Board has adopted a policy which provides that, if a Director up for election does not receive a majority of the votes cast, such Director shall submit an irrevocable resignation to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or such other committee designated by the Board. Such committee will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent Director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the resignation, taking into account the committee’s recommendation, and the Company will publicly disclose the Board’s determination by filing the appropriate disclosure with the SEC detailing the Board’s determination and, if such resignation is rejected, the rationale behind the decision, within 90 days following certification of the election results. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or another designated committee, in making its recommendation, and the Board in making its decision, may each consider any factors and other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. If the Board accepts a Director's resignation, or if a Director nominee is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent Director, then the Board may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws. This policy applies only to uncontested elections of Directors.

Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 19 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Commitment to Sustainability Cavco is a leading designer and builder of systems-built structures including manufactured homes, modular homes, commercial buildings, park model homes, and vacation cabins. Founded in 1965, our operations include 29 homebuilding production lines located throughout the United States and two production lines in Mexico, which build some of the most widely recognizable brand names within the factory-built housing industry. We are committed to providing quality, energy efficient housing at affordable prices in an environmentally conscious manner, as well as adhering to relevant federal and local regulations regarding employee health and safety. The following are important environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) topics identified by the Board and executive team and an explanation of how the Company’s leadership prioritizes these areas of focus in our operations. Board and Senior Management Oversight Cavco’s leadership believes a robust approach to ESG will help us achieve our long-term goals of increasing manufacturing excellence, enhancing our employee and customer experience, serving the communities where we do business, and increasing long-term stockholder value. Our Board provides oversight of our ESG efforts and Cavco’s executive leadership guides and develops these corporate responsibility priorities and provides regular updates to the Board on progress. The Board and its committees support management’s ESG strategy of integrating our ESG principles into our business strategy in ways that optimize opportunities to make positive impacts while advancing the long-term goals stated above. In July 2021, we completed our first assessment of ESG priorities when we posted our Corporate Responsibility Report —examining a range of key stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, rating organizations, and by studying industry peers. We also drew upon the subject matter expertise of colleagues throughout our organization to collect and organize content. In 2022, we posted our second Corporate Responsibility Report as we continued to make notable progress on ESG matters, including the following: • Purposefully integrated sustainability initiatives further into our operations. • Created a cross-functional working group of senior executives to design and lead the Company’s ESG initiatives, prepare our Corporate Responsibility Reports, and monitor overall effectiveness of our ESG program. This ESG working group includes our CEO, the Presidents of our Manufacturing and Retail operations, and leaders of support functions such as Legal. • Adopted an Environmental Stewardship Policy, a Product Safety and Quality Policy, and a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Policy, outlining the Company’s vision and priorities in ESG. • Identified the sources of carbon emissions at production facilities in order to create a baseline for future measurement and calculation of Cavco’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. • Launched a dedicated “Environmental, Social and Governance” website and a FAQ page to communicate the Company’s vision and priorities to investors, customers, employees, and vendors. We are currently preparing our third Corporate Responsibility Report as we build on the lessons we've learned. Against this backdrop, we have engaged with both internal and external stakeholders to develop an ESG strategy going forward. Our ESG strategy is more fully set forth in our Corporate Responsibility Report, which can be found at investor.cavco.com/general-documents/ . There are three areas that we are committed to focusing on in order to achieve our long-term goals: (1) Environmental Responsibility, (2) Social Impact, and (3) Culture of Governance. 20 2024 Proxy Statement Corporate Responsibility Environmental Responsibility Cavco is committed to providing affordable housing and being a responsible steward of the environment by considering the environment while conducting business and complying with environmental laws and regulations. Our business is inherently more environmentally responsible than site-built construction. We are mindful of our cost effectiveness so we can support our commitment to create affordable housing. We intend to keep innovating to increase the energy efficiency of our homes and reduce waste from our manufacturing processes. Cavco is committed to building quality, energy efficient homes for the modern-day home buyer. Cavco invests in a variety of sustainable manufacturing processes to support its green building direction. Senior management leads the strategic direction of the Company and monitors all progress and performance of the Company’s environmental initiatives, while the Board oversees management's efforts. Our focus on improving the environmental performance of our homes involves both design enhancements and choice of renewable materials. Our operations are designed to optimize the following areas: Water and Energy Efficiency Reducing Waste Product Safety and Quality Although minimal water is used in our homebuilding process, we capture, store and reuse rainwater for landscaping needs. Additionally, we seek out and invest in projects that reduce energy use and provide renewable energy for our facilities. Our manufacturing process of building homes in centralized, environmentally protected building centers allows us to minimize adverse impacts on the environment, resulting in reduced levels of waste. Cavco’s homes are built to relevant construction and safety codes, and a majority are built in conformance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards requiring substantive testing on the electricity, water and gas pressure and other safety issues. Further, our homes include environmentally-friendly features such as high indoor air quality, specially designed ventilation systems, and energy-efficient envelopes. Additional highlights of our efforts and accomplishments include: • Utilizing high-efficiency electric equipment including LED and motion detector lighting, and high-efficiency HVAC units. • Ongoing elimination of single-use plastics and the implementation of refill stations to eliminate single-use water bottles. • Encouraging environmentally friendly workplace practices by supporting recycling and separation of waste. • Engaging with qualified third-party energy professionals to conduct regular inspections of our production facilities to provide utility and financial savings information. • Requirement that all materials received from suppliers comply with federal Housing and Urban Development code ("HUD Code") standards. Another example of our commitment to the environmental sustainability of our production processes is the installation of  modern and efficient solar panels on our new Glendale, Arizona production facility. Original estimates projected that the system would generate 2,316.88 MWh in the first year of operation, or about 60% of the plant’s electrical usage, reducing the carbon footprint by approximately 1,642 megatons per year. As of May 2024, with only eight months of operation through the coolest months of the year, the system has already produced 905.87 MWh and saved 1,402,695 lbs. of CO2 emissions. These promising results not only underscore the system’s potential for generating clean energy from the sun, but also highlight the substantial environmental impact of Cavco's solar initiative. The reduction in CO2 emissions so far is equivalent to eliminating the pollution from 621,424 pounds of coal burned or offsetting 1,442,127 miles driven by an average gasoline-powered passenger vehicle. We continue to evaluate additional renewable energy opportunities for our other production facilities and plan to move forward with additional projects. We believe that our focus on environmental responsibility, with the objective of reducing costs and improving sustainability of our operations will provide a strategic benefit to the Company. Furthermore, we recognize that climate change is a growing risk for our planet, and we are committed to doing our part to mitigate this risk by placing increased focus and emphasis on environmental consciousness. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 21 Corporate Responsibility Social Impact Our success is built on the belief that it is our team members who make us great. We have an ongoing focus to continually improve our culture and talent management practices through the implementation of Human Capital Management (“HCM”) reporting and practices. We are committed to pay equity and we regularly review our compensation model to provide fair and inclusive pay practices throughout the business. A diverse and inclusive workplace begins with our core values. Our goal is to attract, retain, and develop a workforce that is diverse in background, knowledge, skill, and experience. We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities and training for all qualified applicants and employees without regard to sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, or any other protected class. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, the Company employed approximately 6,300 employees. Women represented 23% and self-identified ethnic and racial minorities represented 49% of the Company’s workforce. We have established two leadership training programs, called “Navigate” and “Ignition”, for employees in supervisory roles to enhance communication and other critical management skills to improve the oversight and motivation of the workforce. The Navigate program is designed for supervisors and team leads in our manufacturing operations and the Ignition program is geared toward members of the manufacturing and corporate leadership group. As of May 2024, 129 employees have completed the Navigate program and 153 employees have completed Ignition training. The health and wellness of our people is a top priority and in recognition of this we aim to provide a competitive health and wellness package. We regularly update our benefits plans to meet the needs of our diverse workforce. Components of these benefit programs include medical, dental, and vision plans; tax-advantaged flexible spending, dependent care, and health savings accounts; group life insurance; and a 401(k) program with employer match. Employee safety is also a top priority and our expanded approach to improving it has had a measurable and meaningful impact. We are proud of the progress we have made over the last four years in improving the safety of our worksites. In 2022, we began a company-wide safety initiative branded “Safety Now”. This program emphasizes safety awareness and provides training and incentives to create a “safety first” culture. As part of our increased safety training plan, we encourage plant Safety Coordinators to complete an OSHA 10-hour training course. Safety Now has played a role in lowering our Total Recordable Incident Rates (“TRIR”) across our facilities in calendar year 2023 to 5.11, a 33% improvement from the previous year, even as we added four new plants to our system. This TRIR is 35% lower than the industry average of 7.80 over the same period. Our safety efforts are achieving measurable results: • Since calendar year 2020 our TRIR has improved by 50%; • 80% of our production facilities are better than the industry average TRIR; • Since calendar year 2020, we've reduced our workers’ compensation experience modifier from 1.11 to 0.84, a 24% reduction; and • Over the same period we've reduced workers' compensation costs as a percentage of payroll by 33%. 22 2024 Proxy Statement Corporate Responsibility We are also focused on making a positive impact in communities through charity, fundraising, and local community development. The Company strengthens communities by supporting volunteerism and participation in philanthropic initiatives. Our charitable efforts include: • Homes for Our Own – a program created to provide education and financial assistance to employees who wish to become homeowners; • Donations of building materials and volunteer labor to charitable causes; • Monetary donations to many local charities in the communities we serve; and • Financial support for volunteering activities of our business and operational teams. Culture of Governance Cavco’s Board and senior management team believe that a strong focus on governance is foundational to long-term success. We emphasize a culture of accountability and are committed to conducting business in a manner that is fair, ethical, and responsible. We have established and maintain corporate-administered compliance and risk management programs subject to Board oversight to promote adherence with applicable laws and regulations governing the Company’s business practices. We have greatly enhanced our culture of governance in recent years. We’ve added new directors with new skillsets to our Board, with four of our seven directors having joined since 2019. Our Directors' skills matrix is disclosed above under our Corporate Governance Overview. We have implemented new board practices and procedures to improve communications and controls. We separated the role of CEO and Chairman of the Board in order to enhance the independence of our Board. We  increased the diversity of our Board by adding two women, one of which is from an underrepresented group. Six of our seven directors are independent. The Board is governed by a formal Code of Conduct which, along with other policies, is reviewed periodically by our Board. We are subject to rigorous controls, quarterly financial reviews, and annual audits. The Board oversees our audit, compliance, and enterprise risk management practices. Our compliance and risk management teams engage with subject-matter experts to identify, monitor, and mitigate material risks. As we disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we maintain a comprehensive cybersecurity risk management program modeled by standards provided by organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the International Organization for Standardization. Our cybersecurity program includes an incident response plan that addresses the detection, reporting, analysis, response, recovery, communication, documentation, and post-incident review of cybersecurity incidents. We test and evaluate this plan on a routine basis. For material cybersecurity risks, we’ve developed mitigation measures to reduce the risk’s likelihood of occurrence and/or its expected impact. We perform risk assessments throughout the year to identify and remediate potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. Our Board has delegated oversight of risks related to cybersecurity to the Legal and Compliance Oversight Committee and the review of materiality determinations of cyber incidents to the Audit Committee. We also maintain an information security program to protect our information assets, including customer and consumer data. Our IT team works 24/7 and uses a combination of industry-leading tools and in-house innovative technologies to help protect our data. Our team members are responsible for complying with our data security standards and completing mandatory annual training to understand the behaviors and technical requirements necessary to keep customer information secure. We also provide ongoing education for team members to recognize and report suspicious activity. The primary goal of our data security program is to maintain defenses consistent with sound industry practices. We believe these elements combined with a strategically selected Board and senior management team committed to a strong corporate governance culture have set the Company up for long-term success in our industry.

Cavco encourages you to read this CD&A in conjunction with the compensation tables following it. For the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024 ("FY2024"), our NEOs were: NEO Position Bill Boor President & CEO Allison Aden Executive Vice President, CFO, & Treasurer Matt Niño President, Retail ("Ret.") Brian Cira President, Manufacturing ("Mfg.") Steve Like SVP, President (interim), Standard Casualty Company ("Ins.") Mickey Dragash Former Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Corporate Secretary, & Chief Compliance Officer ("Former GC") This CD&A addresses and explains the numerical and related information contained in the Summary Compensation Table and includes actions regarding executive compensation that occurred during FY2024, including the award of incentive compensation related to FY2024 performance. Overview of the Company’s Compensation Program The Company’s FY2024 executive compensation program consisted of three components: (1) cash compensation comprised of an annual base salary, (2) short-term incentive compensation comprised of a cash bonus and/or cash incentive compensation, and (3) long-term incentive compensation, which consisted of awards of RSUs and performance-based restricted stock units that vest upon the achievement of preapproved Company performance measures over a set period of time (“PRSUs”). Component Key Elements Base Salaries Market based to attract and retain an effective executive team Short-Term Incentive Compensation • Company performance-based short-term incentive program • For several positions, a portion of the award potential is determined by individual performance targets • Bonus payouts capped at 200% of target Long-Term Incentive Compensation • Equity issued as RSUs and PRSUs pursuant to the Co mpany’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005 Stock Plan”) • RSU grants based on a targeted dollar value on grant date and vest annually over 3 years • PRSU grants are earned based upon Company performance of 3-year targets; settlements are capped at 200% of target award Compensation Philosophy We believe that our executive compensation program should align with the interests of our stockholders and be tied to performance. We view our compensation practices as a means for motivating and rewarding employees in relation to their accomplishments. Our approach is to provide incentive driven market-based compensation programs with the objective of hiring and retaining the talent best suited to deliver sustained high performance to the Company and its stockholders and the customers we serve. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 27 Executive Compensation Objectives of the Company’s FY2024 Executive Compensation Program The Company’s executive compensation program was structured to achieve the following objectives: • create an incentive to increase stockholder returns by establishing a direct and substantial link between individual compensation and certain financial measures of the Company that we believe have a direct effect on stockholder value; • attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified and talented executives, enabling the Company to deliver superior results and growth; and • create substantial and competitive long-term compensation opportunities for individual executive officers based not only on long-term, corporate performance but also on sustained, long-term individual performance. Role of the Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee reviews the compensation paid to our Executive Officers annually and recommends to the Board for approval, all salary and other remuneration to our Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee operates pursuant to a written charter that sets forth its specific functions and responsibilities. Pursuant to its authority under its written charter, to the extent permitted by Nasdaq Rules and applicable legal requirements, the Compensation Committee may form subcommittees and delegate specified duties and responsibilities to those subcommittees. The Compensation Committee Charter is posted on our website at investor.cavco.com/general-documents . Role of Management in Establishing and Awarding Compensation The CEO may assist the Compensation Committee by making recommendations concerning the Company’s performance objectives upon which short-term and long-term incentive compensation is based. Additionally, the CEO annually reviews the performance of the other Executive Officers and presents his conclusions and recommendations regarding salary, short-term incentive payout adjustments, and long-term incentive awards to the Compensation Committee for its consideration. The Compensation Committee does not receive any recommendations from the CEO regarding his own compensation. Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant Pursuant to the authority granted to it in its charter, the Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer Partners, LLC (“Pearl Meyer”) as an independent compensation consultant to provide advice related to the Company’s executive compensation programs for FY2024. Pearl Meyer reports directly to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may replace Pearl Meyer or hire additional consultants at any time. Pearl Meyer attends meetings of the Compensation Committee, as requested, and communicates with the Compensation Committee Chair. However, the Compensation Committee ultimately has sole authority to make suggestions and recommendations to the Board related to potential compensation for our Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the services provided by its outside consultants and believes that Pearl Meyer is independent in providing executive compensation consulting services. The Compensation Committee conducted a review of its relationship with Pearl Meyer in October 2023 and determined that Pearl Meyer’s work for the Compensation Committee had not raised any conflicts of interest consistent with the guidance provided by the SEC and Nasdaq. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee considered the following: • Pearl Meyer did not provide any services to the Company, or its management, other than services to the Compensation Committee. Pearl Meyer’s services were limited to executive and director compensation consulting. Specifically, Pearl Meyer does not provide to the Company, directly or indirectly through affiliates, any non-executive compensation services, including, but not limited to, pension consulting or human resource outsourcing; • Fees paid to Pearl Meyer by the Company were less than 1% of Pearl Meyer’s total revenue; • Pearl Meyer maintains a Conflicts Policy containing specific policies and procedures designed to ensure independence; • None of the Pearl Meyer consultants on the Company’s matters had any business or personal relationship with the members of the Compensation Committee; • None of the Pearl Meyer consultants on the Company matters, or Pearl Meyer, had any business or personal relationship with executive officers of the Company; and • None of the Pearl Meyer consultants on the Company matters own Company stock. In December 2023, the Compensation Committee completed its process of interviewing and hiring a new independent compensation consultant to advise the committee. The Compensation Committee reappointed Pearl Meyer from various candidates recommended by members of the Board and continues to monitor the independence of its compensation consultant on a periodic basis. 28 2024 Proxy Statement Executive Compensation Clawback Policy The Board has adopted a policy providing for the recoupment from certain executives of incentive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement or the occurrence of other clawback events described in the policy (the "Clawback Policy"). The policy is designed to deter and prevent detrimental conduct and to protect our investors from financial misconduct. The Clawback Policy is posted on our website at investor.cavco.com/general-documents . Stockholder Approval of our Compensation Decisions At the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on August 1, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved the advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation with 97% of the votes entitled to vote and represented by person or by proxy cast in favor of the proposal regarding the Company’s executive compensation program. Our Board and management believe this vote indicates support by our stockholders for our executive compensation program and amounts. Benchmarking Methodology Market pay levels are one of many elements used by the Company to maintain competitive pay opportunities for our Executive Officers. For the design of the Company’s fiscal year 2024 executive compensation program, in January 2023, the Compensation Committee approved a peer group of 23 national companies in the building products, homebuilding, and related industries for the purposes of benchmarking total compensation for our Executive Officers. The peer group companies were analyzed and  recommended by our independent compensation consultant and our Compensation Committee approved the peer group set forth below. The Compensation Committee considered a two year comparison of CEO compensation for the peer group in order to account for any statistical outliers in benchmarking decisions.

Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 29 Components of Annual Executive Compensation Base Salary The purpose of the base salary is to provide a fixed amount of non-variable cash compensation that is generally competitive with market practices to attract and retain an effective management team. Consistent with our pay-for-performance objective, the base salary for each of our NEOs is designed to account for only a portion of their overall total target compensation. We believe the NEO base salaries are appropriate when compared to market benchmarks and based on the Executive Officers’ roles, responsibilities, experience, and contributions to the Company. For fiscal years 2023 and 2024, the Board approved the following base salaries for each of our NEOs: Name 2023 Annual Base Salary 2024 Annual Base Salary Percentage Increase Bill Boor, CEO $950,000 $950,000 0% Allison Aden, CFO $450,000 $550,000 22% Brian Cira, President (Mfg.) $250,000 $250,000 0% Matt Niño, President (Ret.) $200,000 $200,000 0% Steve Like, President (Ins.) $200,000 $250,000 25% Mickey Dragash, Former GC $325,000 $325,000 0% Short-Term Incentive Compensation The second component of our annual executive compensation is our short-term incentive program ("STIP"). The STIP consists of an annual cash incentive bonus based upon both (1) Company performance, and (2) individual objective-based performance. In addition, Messrs. Cira and Nino both receive a third part of STIP based on the profits of the business operations each oversees. Mr. Boor's STIP payout is predicated solely on Company performance. The following table summarizes the component and total STIP payouts made to our NEOs for FY2024. Mr. Dragash is not included in the following STIP tables and discussion because he was not serving as an Executive Officer at the end of FY2024 (see "Summary Compensation Table" below for details on FY2024 compensation paid to Mr. Dragash): Name Company Performance Component Individual Objective Component Business Profit Component Total STIP Payout Bill Boor , CEO $753,730 — — $753,730 Allison Aden , CFO $297,525 $100,000 — $397,525 Brian Cira, President (Mfg.) $33,058 $40,000 $748,893 $821,951 Matt Niño , President (Ret.) $33,058 $50,000 $963,660 $1,046,718 Steve Like , President (Ins.) $156,117 $100,000 — $256,117 1. Company Performance : For FY2024, the threshold, target, and maximum Company performance STIP payouts are expressed below as a percentage of each NEO's base salary: Name Threshold (x of Target) Target Maximum (x of Target) Bill Boor , CEO 0.5x 120% 2x Allison Aden , CFO 0.5x 82% 2x Brian Cira, President (Mfg.) 0.5x 20% 1.5x Matt Niño , President (Ret.) 0.5x 25% 1.5x Steve Like , President (Ins.) 0.75x 80% 1.5x In May 2023, the Board approved two metrics to measure FY2024 Company performance and align our NEO's incentives with our stockholders' interests. • Factory-Built Housing Profits . 90% of the Company performance payout is based on FY2024 adjusted factory-built housing segment pre-tax profit, where target was based on the budgeted pre-tax profit, with threshold attainment being at 70% of the forecast and stretch attainment being 130% of the forecast; and 30 2024 Proxy Statement Executive Compensation • Financial Services Profits . 10% of the Company performance payout is based on FY2024 adjusted financial services segment pre-tax profit, where target was based on the forecasted pre-tax profit, with threshold attainment being at 70% of the forecast and stretch attainment being 130% of the forecast. A graphical depiction of the FY2024 Company performance targets and actual results are set forth below: 90% of factory-built housing – Earnings driven corporate STIP 10% of financial services – Earnings driven corporate STIP Given these results, in May 2024, the Board approved FY2024 Company performance STIP payouts to Mr. Boor, Ms. Aden, and Messrs. Cira, Niño, and Like of $753,730, $297,525, $33,058, $33,058, and $156,117, respectively. These payments are reflected in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table. In addition to the Company performance-based STIP payouts described above, Mr. Cira and Mr. Niño are both eligible to receive a percentage of the pre-tax income of the manufacturing and retail operations each respectively oversees. In FY2024, Mr. Cira received 0.425% of pre-tax income for the manufacturing operations he oversees which came to $748,893. Mr. Niño received 4% of the pre-tax income for the retail operations he oversees which came to $963,660 for FY2024. These payments are also reflected in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table. 2. Individual Objective-Based Performance : The elements that comprise each individual’s performance objectives vary by position and are mutually agreed upon by each NEO and the CEO. These objectives primarily consist of measurable goals that have a meaningful impact upon our overall financial performance as well as each executive's professional development. In May 2023, the Board set the following FY2024 individual performance STIP targets for our NEOs as a percentage of each NEO's base salary: For Ms. Aden, an award of 18% of her base salary; for Mr. Like, an award of 40% of his base salary; for Mr. Cira, an award of 20% of his base salary; and for Mr. Niño, an award of 25% of his base salary. In May 2024, for the achievement of individual performance objectives in FY2024, the Board approved payments for this individual performance STIP component to Ms. Aden and Messrs. Cira, Niño, and Like in the amounts of $100,000, $40,000, $50,000, and $100,000, respectively. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 31 Executive Compensation Long-Term Incentive Compensation The third component of our annual executive compensation program is long-term incentive compensation. The Company’s FY2024 long-term incentive program ("LTIP") consisted of equity awards of (1) RSUs (time-based vesting) and (2) PRSUs (performance-based vesting). In May and June 2023, the Board approved FY2024 LTIP awards of RSUs and PRSUs to the NEOs as set forth in the table below. All awards were made pursuant to the 2005 Stock Plan. The total grant date value of these equity awards is disclosed below in the Stock Awards column of the Summary Compensation Table. Name FY2024 RSUs (#) FY2024 PRSUs at target (#) Bill Boor , CEO 3,800 5,700 Allison Aden , CFO 1,536 2,034 Brian Cira, President (Mfg.) 475 712 Matt Niño , President (Ret.) 339 509 Steve Like , President (Ins.) 407 610 Mick Dragash , Former GC (1) 500 700 (1)  The FY2024 RSU and PRSU awards to Mr. Dragash were subsequently prorated upon execution of his Release of Claims Agreement, dated March 5, 2024, as set forth below in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table. 1. FY2024 RSUs : The RSUs awarded for FY2024 are subject to a time-based vesting schedule such that 33% of the shares vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, 33% on the second anniversary of the grant date, and 34% on the third anniversary of the grant date. RSUs make up 40% of the value of the FY2024 LTIP payout to our NEOs. 2. FY2024 PRSUs : PRSUs make up 60% of the value of the FY2024 LTIP payout to our NEOs. The metrics used for the design of the FY2024 PRSUs issued to our NEOs incentivize performance over a period of three years in two distinct areas: value creation and growth. • Value creation is measured by total shareholder return relative to our peer group. • Growth is measured by our volume improvement compared to the manufactured housing industry. Each measure is weighted equally when determining overall performance for the period and is measured individually on threshold (50%), target (100%), and stretch (200%) levels. Shares under the FY2024 PRSU awards will be measured and issued in May 2026, at the end of the three year performance period from FY2024 through fiscal year 2026. Earnout of Fiscal Year 2022 PRSU Awards at Conclusion of Performance Period In FY2024, our NEOs also received the earnout of PRSU awards they had received on May 24, 2021 (the "FY2022 PRSUs") for the performance during fiscal years 2022 to 2024 (the "Performance Period"). The grant date value of these FY2022 PRSUs was part of the LTIP compensation paid to our NEOs for fiscal year 2022 ("FY2022") and disclosed in the CD&A section of our proxy filed with the SEC on June 21, 2022. In May 2024, the Board approved the payout of the FY2022 PRSUs. The performance measures for these FY2022 PRSUs included volume improvement, operational improvement, and value creation measured individually on threshold (50%), target (100%), and stretch (200%) levels. The performance results of these measures are set forth in the table below: Measure Weight Threshold 50% Target 100% Stretch 200% Results to Date Volume Improvement 33% 0% 5% 10% 23.4% Operational Improvement 33% 2% 5% 8% 3.1% Value Creation 34% 20% 50% 80% 49.0% • Volume Improvement : Volume improvement, or market share, was determined by reference to the percentage difference between: (i) the total number of Company units shipped during fiscal year 2021 ("FY2021") divided by the number of HUD Code Home shipments during the same period and (ii) the total number of Company units shipped during FY2024 divided by the number of HUD Code Home shipments during the same period. • Operational Improvement : Operational improvement is measured by the improvement in the number of floors produced per employee equivalent. Floors per employee was determined by dividing: (i) the total number of floors produced per employee equivalent during FY2024 by (ii) the total number of floors produced per employee equivalent during FY2021. 32 2024 Proxy Statement Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee, at its discretion, may include or exclude certain plant operations from the Performance Period calculation. • Value Creation : Measured by Relative Total Shareholder Return (“rTSR”) relative to our peer group and was determined with respect to the Company and the rTSR comparator companies by dividing: (a) the sum of (i) the difference between the applicable beginning stock price and the applicable ending stock price plus (ii) all dividends and other distributions on the respective shares with an ex-dividend date that falls during the Performance Period, by (b) the applicable beginning stock price. To determine the Company’s applicable percentile ranking, the Company and each rTSR comparator corporation are arranged by their respective total shareholder returns (highest to lowest). Based on the metrics above for the FY2022 PRSUs, the number of PRSUs issued to each NEO in May 2024 and the percentage of target this payout represented are set forth in the following table: NEO FY2022 PRSU Target Payout (# shares) FY2022 PRSU Actual Payout (# shares) FY2022 PRSU Actual Percentage of Target (%) Bill Boor , CEO 4,500 5,506 122% Allison Aden , CFO 920 971 106% Brian Cira , President (Mfg.) 400 421 105% Matt Niño , President (Ret.) 250 263 105% Steve Like , President (Ins.) 300 316 105% Mickey Dragash , Former GC 600 571 95% Perquisites and Other Compensation Cavco does not offer significant perquisites to its NEOs. The NEOs may participate in the Company’s 401(k) plan and other health and welfare programs that are available to all other full-time employees. Amounts paid to our NEOs under the Cavco's 401(k) plan are reflected in the All Other Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table below.

Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 39 Option Exercises and Stock Vested The following table discloses certain information regarding options exercised by the NEOs and shares of stock vested for each NEO during the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024. OPTION AWARDS STOCK AWARDS Name Number of shares acquired on exercise (#) Value realized on exercise ($) (1) Number of shares acquired on vesting (#) Value realized on vesting ($) (2) Bill Boor , CEO 4,000 651,560 8,292 2,381,349 Allison Aden , CFO — — 933 258,274 Brian Cira , President (Mfg.) — — 409 111,645 Matt Niño , President (Ret.) 2,300 463,010 586 166,646 Steve Like , President (Ins.) 3,000 454,680 743 211,720 Mickey Dragash , Former GC — — 1,822 (3) 580,639 (1) The value realized for the option awards is the difference between the market price of the underlying security at exercise and the exercise price of the option multiplied by the number of shares acquired on exercise. (2) The value realized upon the vesting of stock is the number of vested shares of stock multiplied by the market value of the shares on the vesting date. (3) Includes 634 RSUs which vested upon execution of Mr. Dragash's Release of Claims Agreement, dated March 5, 2024, in addition to 1,188 RSUs that vested in May 2023 under the terms of his award agreements. Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control The following table describes and quantifies the potential payments that we would provide to our NEOs in connection with termination of employment, including for good reason, cause, or change in control. The amounts that would actually be paid to an NEO upon a termination of employment would depend on the circumstances and timing of termination. The terms “Good Reason”, “Cause”, and “Change in Control” are defined in the executives’ various employment agreements, which are more fully described above under "Employment Agreements in Effect for 2024". All severance payments under the employment agreements are conditioned upon the delivery and non-revocation of a customary release by the executive in favor of the Company. Each of the employment agreements include customary provisions concerning the timing, limitation, and alteration of payments to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). For payments due to a termination upon a Change in Control, the terms of our NEO’s agreements make payment due only upon a double trigger of both a Change in Control and termination without cause. Consistent with the SEC’s rules and regulations concerning executive compensation disclosure, the potential value of benefits payable assumes that the termination occurred on the last business day of FY2024, March 29, 2024. For each equity award affected, the value of the acceleration of stock vestings was computed based on a closing price of $399.06 per share on March 29, 2024. Total termination benefits represent payments for severance, non-compete, and non-disclosure covenants.

He was paid $681,846 pursuant to the terms of his Employment Agreement, dated April 19, 2019, upon the execution of his Release of Claims Agreement, dated March 5, 2024. 40 2024 Proxy Statement CEO Pay Ratio CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure In accordance with Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee. In determining the median compensated employee, SEC rules allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, apply certain exclusions, and make reasonable estimates and assumptions reflecting their unique employee populations. Therefore, our reported pay ratio may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in industry, business models and scale, as well as the different estimates, assumptions, and methodologies applied by other companies in calculating their respective pay ratios. Excluding our CEO, we identified our median employee by preparing a list of all 6,351 individuals employed by the Company as of March 30, 2024, and examined the total compensation paid to each such individual as reflected in the Company’s payroll records. We included all employees (other than our CEO), whether employed on a full-time, part-time, seasonal or temporary basis. We annualized the compensation for any permanent employees who were not employed by us for all of FY2024. From that listing, we identified a small sample of 15 employees, consisting of the median employee and 14 other employees whose gross pay was very close to the median employee’s gross pay (“Median Group”). We then calculated annual total compensation for such employees using the same methodology we use to calculate NEO compensation for the summary compensation table and selected the median employee from the Median Group. The FY2024 annual total compensation of our CEO was $4,510,808, the FY2024 annual total compensation of our median employee was $48,821, and the ratio of these amounts is 92:1. Cavco's Practices Related to the Grants of Certain Equity Awards Close in Time to the Release of Material Non-Public Information Our executive compensation program has not included awards of stock options as a part of the long-term incentive component since fiscal year 2021. We have no policy, program, practice, or plan pertaining to the timing of stock option grants to our NEOs coinciding with the release of material nonpublic information. We also have not timed the release of material non-public information for the purpose of affecting the value of any executive or Director compensation, and we have no plan to do so. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 41 Pay versus Performance As required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and certain measures of financial performance of the Company.

Consistent with the mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are seeking stockholder approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed pursuant to the SEC’s compensation disclosure rules (which disclosure includes the CD&A and the related compensation tables in this Proxy Statement). We currently present the Say on Pay advisory vote to our stockholders annually at each annual meeting of stockholders. The next Say on Pay advisory vote is expected to occur at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders. For a comprehensive description of our executive compensation program and philosophy, please refer to the narrative disclosures in the CD&A section of this Proxy Statement. Although the advisory vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board will review the results of the vote and consider the outcome when making future decisions concerning Cavco’s executive compensation program. In deciding how to vote on this proposal the Board points out the following factors, many of which are more fully discussed in the CD&A: • Our executive compensation programs are designed to depend significantly on the achievement of performance goals that the Compensation Committee believes drive long-term shareholder value; • Our pay practices are designed not to encourage management to take unacceptable risks; • Our Compensation Committee reviews peer group compensation to confirm that our programs are not outside the norm among peer group companies (see the CD&A subsection “Benchmarking Methodology”); and • We believe the Company’s executive compensation programs are well suited to promote the Company’s objectives in both the short and long-term. Recommendation of the Board The Board recommends a vote “ FOR ” the following advisory resolution: RESOLVED, that the stockholders of the Company approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company’s NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K , including the CD&A, Summary Compensation Table, related compensation tables, notes and narrative discussion in this Proxy Statement. 46 2024 Proxy Statement Audit Fees The following table represents the aggregate fees billed to Cavco for professional services provided by RSM US LLP (“RSM”) in the last two fiscal years. 2024 2023 Audit Fees $ 1,488,480 $ 1,503,220 Audit-Related Fees - - Tax Fees 607,850 523,100 All Other Fees - - Total $ 2,096,330 $ 2,026,320 The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures pre-approving all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by RSM. These policies and procedures require that the Company may not engage RSM to render audit or non-audit services unless the Audit Committee specifically approves the service in advance or the engagement is entered into pursuant to a pre-approval authorization. In determining whether or not to pre-approve services, the Audit Committee determines whether the service is a permissible service under the SEC’s rules and, if permissible, the potential effect of such services on the independence of RSM. The Audit Committee may also authorize any Committee member to approve any audit or non-audit related services that RSM may provide. Any approval of services by an Audit Committee member pursuant to this delegated authority is to be reported at the next meeting of the Audit Committee. All of the audit fees, tax fees and all other fees resulting from services provided by RSM as set forth in the table above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the foregoing procedures. As used in the above table: • “Audit Fees” are the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Form 10-K, internal controls and review of Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Form 10-Q quarterly reports or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. • “Tax Fees” are the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. • “All Other Fees” are for all other services not captured in the audit or tax categories. All work performed during the FY2024 and FY2023 audits was completed by full-time employees of RSM. Cavco Industries, Inc. www.cavco.com 47 Audit Committee Report Report of the Audit Committee In accordance with its written charter, the primary function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of: (i) the quality and integrity of Cavco’s accounting, auditing, and financial reporting practices and processes; (ii) the financial information to be provided to the stockholders of Cavco; (iii) the systems of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting established by management; (iv) compliance with the Company’s Code of Conduct; (v) the independent auditors’ qualifications and independence; (vi) the performance of the Company’s independent auditors; and (vii) the internal audit process.

The independent auditors are engaged to audit and report on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee’s responsibility is to monitor these processes. In discharging its duties, the Audit Committee has: (i) reviewed and discussed with management the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 30, 2024; (ii) discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the SEC; (iii) received and reviewed the written disclosures along with the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence; (iv) discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm such independent registered public accounting firm’s independence; and (v) discussed with management critical accounting policies and the processes and controls related to the President and Chief Executive Officer’s and the Chief Financial Officer’s financial reporting certifications required by the SEC and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to accompany the Company’s periodic filings with the SEC.

Sze 48 2024 Proxy Statement PROPOSAL NO. 3: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Audit Committee has appointed RSM as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2025. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider the retention of RSM but may still engage RSM. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee in its sole discretion may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Cavco and its stockholders.

These policies and procedures are generally not in writing but are evidenced by long standing principles set forth in our Code of Conduct and adhered to by our Board. As set forth in the Audit Committee Charter and to the extent required under applicable federal securities laws and related rules and regulations, and/or the Nasdaq Rules, related party transactions are to be reviewed and approved, if appropriate, by the Audit Committee.

These references are merely intended to suggest where additional information may be obtained by our stockholders, and the materials and other information presented on our website are not incorporated in and should not otherwise be considered part of this Proxy. Householding of Proxy Materials The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy materials with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single copy of the proxy materials addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” provides cost savings for companies. The Company and some brokers household proxy materials, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate set of proxy materials, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or the Company if you hold shares directly. You can notify the Company by sending a written request to Cavco Industries, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 3636 North Central Avenue, Suite 1200, Phoenix, Arizona 85012. However, please note that if you want to receive a paper proxy or voting instruction form or other proxy materials with respect to the meeting, you should follow the instructions to request such materials included in the Notice that was sent to you. 50 2024 Proxy Statement Stockholder Director Nominations and Stockholder Proposals for the 2025 Annual Meeting Stockholders of the Company may nominate directors to the Board for vote at the 2025 annual meeting or propose other business at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders by following the procedures in our Bylaws.
