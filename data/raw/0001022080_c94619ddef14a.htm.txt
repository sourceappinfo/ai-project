signed proxy but give us no instructions as to one or more
matters, the proxy will be voted on those matters in accordance
with the recommendations of our Board of Directors as indicated
in this proxy statement. You may revoke your proxy, at any time
before it is voted, by written notice to us, by submission of
another proxy bearing a later date or by voting in person at the
meeting. Your revocation will not affect a vote on any matters
already taken. Your mere presence at the meeting will not revoke
your proxy. This solicitation is made by Midway Games Inc. We are mailing
this proxy statement and the accompanying form of proxy
beginning on or about April 29, 2005, to our stockholders
of record on April 18, 2005 (the “Record Date”).
In addition to the solicitation of proxies by use of the mails,
some of our officers, directors and other employees may also

telephone or facsimile transmission, but they will not receive
additional compensation for those services. We will ask
brokerage firms, custodians, banks, nominees and other
fiduciaries holding shares of our common stock in their names to
forward proxy soliciting material to their principals, and we
will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
There will not be any costs in connection with this

stockholders, the cost of which will be borne by Midway. Only holders of our common stock, $.01 par value per share,

entitled to vote at our annual meeting or any adjournments.
There were 86,830,487 shares of our common stock
outstanding on the Record Date (excluding treasury shares). Each
share of our common stock entitles the holder to one vote on
each matter at the meeting. Approval of Proposals The affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of our common
stock present in person or by proxy is required to elect
directors, and the affirmative vote of a majority of our common
stock present and entitled to vote is required to approve the
other proposals. In addition, under NYSE rules, with respect to
any proposal that is a prerequisite to listing of additional or
new securities, the total vote cast on the proposal must
represent at least a majority of all outstanding shares of our
common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. As of the Record Date, Sumner M. Redstone controlled over 79% of
our outstanding common stock. See “Security Ownership of
Certain Beneficial Owners and Management” below.
Mr. Redstone has advised us that he intends to cause all
the shares of our common stock beneficially owned by him and by
National Amusements, a company that he controls, to be voted in
favor of each of the proposals described Table of Contents in this proxy statement, which will ensure the approval of each
such proposal at the meeting. Our Directors have also advised us

engaged a financial advisor to provide services in connection
with the evaluation of a possible “going private” or
other transaction in which Mr. Redstone would acquire more
than eighty percent of the issued and outstanding equity of
Midway. In public filings, he also stated that Midway could be
considered as a potential Viacom acquisition candidate. Viacom
has established an Ad Hoc Committee on Electronic Games to
consider any proposed transactions or business arrangements
between Viacom and Midway. According to Viacom’s proxy
statement for its 2005 annual meeting filed with the SEC, that
committee is comprised of three independent directors who are
disinterested with respect to matters relating to Midway. Midway
also has formed a special independent committee to consider any
proposed transactions between Midway and Mr. Redstone or
any of his affiliates, comprised of three independent directors
who are disinterested with respect to matters relating to

NOMINEES FOR ELECTION AS DIRECTORS. 5 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Board of Directors Our Board of Directors is our ultimate decision-making body,
responsible for overseeing our affairs, except with respect to
those matters reserved to the stockholders by law or under our
By-laws. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Principles
and a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, each of which can be
viewed on our Internet website at www.investor.midway.com. These documents describe the
responsibilities of our directors, the organization of our Board
and other key corporate governance matters. We will provide a
copy of these documents to stockholders, without charge, upon
written request addressed to Midway Games Inc., 2704 West Roscoe
Street, Chicago, IL 60618, Attention: Investor Relations. “Controlled Company” Exemptions. Our common
stock is listed for trading on the NYSE. The listing standards
of the NYSE impose requirements on the Board of Directors and
committees of listed issuers that include, among others, the
following requirements: • A majority of the members of the Board of Directors must qualify
    as “independent” directors who have no material
    relationship with the issuer other than serving as a director
    and who meet the other requirements of independence set forth in
    Section 303A.02 of the listing standards of the NYSE; • Issuers have a nominating and corporate governance committee (or
    committees that are responsible for each of these functions)
    composed entirely of independent directors; and • Issuers have a compensation committee composed entirely of
    independent directors. The NYSE permits “controlled companies” to take
advantage of exemptions from the above three requirements. For
these purposes, a controlled company is a company of which more
than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group
or another company. Since Mr. Redstone’s ownership of
our common stock exceeds 50%, we are a controlled company.
However, our Board of Directors has determined that, at present,
we will not elect to take advantage of any of the above
exemptions from the NYSE listing standards. Director Independence. It has been our policy, and unless
we elect to rely on a controlled company exemption it is a
requirement of the listing standards of the NYSE, that a
majority of the members of our Board must qualify as
“independent” directors who have no material
relationship with us, other than serving as a director. Our
Board has adopted the following categorical standards to assist
it in making independence determinations, as permitted by NYSE
rules, and has determined that any director who meets these
standards shall be deemed an independent director: • The director is not and has not been our employee for at least
    three years, and no member of the director’s immediate
    family is or has been our executive officer for at least three
    years; • The director has not received, and no member of his immediate
    family has received during any 12-month period in the last three
    years, more than $100,000 per year in direct compensation
    from us, other than director and committee fees and pension or
    other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided
    such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued
    service); • Neither the director nor any member of his immediate family
    (x) is a partner or employee of a firm that is our internal
    or external auditor or (y) was, within the last three
    years, a partner or employee of such a firm and personally
    worked on our audit within that time; • Neither the director nor any member of his immediate family has
    been employed within the last three years as an executive
    officer of another company where any of our present executive
    officers at the same time serves or served on that
    company’s compensation committee; and • A director is not an executive officer or an employee, and no
    member of his immediate family is an executive officer, of a
    company that in any of the last three fiscal years has made
    payments to, or received payments from us for property or
    services in an amount which, in any such single fiscal year,
    exceeded the greater of $1 million, or 2% of such other
    company’s consolidated gross revenues. 6 Table of Contents Our Board has determined that all of the existing members of our
Board of Directors meet these categorical standards and are
therefore independent directors. Our new director nominee also
meets these standards. In addition, to be nominated for election
to our Board, all director candidates must satisfy the
qualification standards discussed below under the heading
“Nominating Committee Policies.” Board and Committee Meetings. During fiscal 2004, the
Board held 20 meetings. Each director except Mr. Califano
and Ms. Redstone attended at least 75% of the aggregate
number of meetings of the Board and all committees on which he
or she served during the fiscal year. Mr. Califano attended
68.8% of such meetings, and Ms. Redstone attended 69.2% of
such meetings. Director Compensation We pay a fee of $32,500 per year to each director who is
not also our employee. A director who serves as the chairman of
the Compensation Committee, Special Committee of Independent
Directors or Nominating Committee of the Board receives a
further fee of $2,500 per year for his or her services in
that capacity, and each other member of those Committees
receives an additional fee of $1,000 per year. A director
who serves as the chairman of the Corporate Governance Committee
of the Board receives a further fee of $7,500 per year for
his or her services in that capacity, and each other member of
that Committee receives an additional fee of $5,000 per
year. A director who serves as the chairman of the Audit
Committee of the Board receives a further fee of
$20,000 per year for his or her services in that capacity,
and each other member of that committee receives an additional
fee of $15,000 per year. Some of our directors and their families are entitled to receive
reimbursement for health insurance costs under our Exec-U-Care
supplemental health care insurance program. In fiscal 2004, we
paid the following amounts to directors under this program:
$3,715 to Harold H. Bach Jr., $6,196 to Robert N. Waxman,
$12,316 to our former chairman, Neil D. Nicastro, and $21,734 to
our former director, Richard D. White. Our directors may also receive options to purchase shares of
common stock under our stock option plans. These options have
generally been granted at 100% of market value on the date of
grant. On June 10, 2004, each of the following former
directors were granted a five-year option to
purchase 25,000 shares of our common stock, at an
exercise price of $12.26 per share: Messrs. William
McKenna, Norman Menell, Harvey Reich and Richard White. If our
2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan is approved, directors will be
eligible to participate in awards under that plan. Committees of the Board of Directors To assist it in carrying out its duties, the Board has delegated
specific authority to several committees. In addition, our
directors, none of whom are members of management, hold regular
executive sessions without management being present.
Mr. Cron, the Chairman of our Board, presides at these
sessions. We have the following standing committees of the Board: Audit
Committee, Nominating Committee, Corporate Governance Committee
and Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors has
determined that all of the members of these committees are
“independent” directors as that term is defined under
the NYSE listing standards. The Audit Committee is composed of four independent
directors (as independence is defined in the NYSE listing
standards and SEC rules): Messrs. Waxman (Chairman), Bach,
Bartholomay and Califano. The Board has determined that each of
Messrs. Bach and Waxman is an audit committee
“financial expert”. In addition, each member of our
Audit Committee is financially literate, in the Board’s
determination, and satisfies the definition of
“independence” required of audit committee members
under the NYSE listing standards and SEC rules. This Committee meets periodically with the independent auditors
and internal personnel to: (1) consider the adequacy of
internal accounting controls, our internal audit function and
finance department staffing; (2) receive and review the

responsibilities of the committee and its process for
identifying director candidates as well as other policies and
procedures. The Process of Identifying and Evaluating Candidates for
    Directors Our Nominating Committee identifies and evaluates director
candidates and recommends the selection of nominees to our Board
of Directors. The Board then considers the recommendation and
selects the nominees. In recommending candidates for nomination
for election to the Board at our annual meetings of
stockholders, the Nominating Committee begins by determining
whether the incumbent directors, whose terms expire at the
meeting, desire and are qualified to continue their service on
the Board and evaluates their performance on the Board. We are
of the view that the continuing service of qualified incumbents
promotes stability and continuity in the boardroom, giving us
the benefit of the familiarity and insight into our affairs that
our directors have accumulated during their tenure, while
contributing to the Board’s ability to work as a collective
body. If there are new Board positions or vacancies on the Board, the
Nominating Committee will solicit recommendations for nominees
from persons whom the Nominating Committee believes are likely
to be familiar with qualified candidates, including members of
the Board and senior management. The Nominating Committee may
also engage a search firm to assist in identifying qualified
candidates. The Nominating Committee will review and evaluate
each candidate whom it believes merits serious consideration,
taking into account all available information concerning the
candidate, the qualifications for Board membership established
by the Nominating Committee, the existing composition and mix of
talent and expertise on the Board and other factors that it
deems relevant. In conducting its review and evaluation, the
Nominating Committee may solicit the views of management and
other members of the Board and may, if deemed helpful, conduct
interviews of proposed candidates. The Nominating Committee will evaluate candidates recommended by
stockholders in the same manner as candidates recommended by
other persons, except that the Nominating Committee may
consider, as one of the factors in its evaluation of
stockholder-recommended candidates, the size and duration of the
interest of the recommending stockholder or stockholder group in
our equity securities. Qualifications of Directors Our policy is generally to require that all candidates for
director be persons of integrity and sound ethical character and
judgment, have no interests that materially conflict with ours
or those of our stockholders generally, have meaningful
business, governmental or technical experience and acumen and
have adequate time to devote to service on the Board. We have
also required that a majority of directors be independent; at
least three of the directors must have the financial literacy
and special independence qualifications necessary for service on
the Audit Committee, and at least one of these directors must
qualify as an audit committee financial expert. Stockholder Recommendation of Candidates for Election as
    Directors The Nominating Committee will consider recommendations for
director nominations submitted by stockholders that individually
or as a group have beneficial ownership of at least 3% of our
common stock and have had such ownership for at least one year.
Submissions must be made in accordance with the Committee’s
procedures, as outlined below and set forth in Appendix B to this proxy statement. For each annual
meeting of our stockholders, the Nominating Committee will
accept for consideration only one 9 Table of Contents recommendation from any stockholder or affiliated group of
stockholders. The Committee waives this requirement with respect
to Mr. Redstone and National Amusements in view of their
majority ownership of our common stock. The Nominating Committee
will only consider candidates who satisfy our minimum
qualifications for director, as outlined above. Procedures for Stockholder Submission of Nominating
    Recommendations A stockholder wishing to recommend to the Nominating Committee a
candidate for election as director must submit the
recommendation in writing, addressed to the Committee care of
our corporate secretary at 2704 West Roscoe Street, Chicago,
Illinois 60618. Submissions recommending candidates for election
at an annual meeting of stockholders must be received no later
than 120 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the
date of the proxy statement for the prior annual meeting of
stockholders. In the event that the date of the next annual
meeting of stockholders is more than 30 days following or
preceding the first anniversary date of the annual meeting of
stockholders for the prior year, the submission must be made a
reasonable time in advance of the mailing of our next annual
proxy statement. Each nominating recommendation must be
accompanied by the information called for by our
“Procedures for Stockholders Submitting Nominating
Recommendations,” which is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement. This includes specified information
concerning the stockholder or group of stockholders making the
recommendation, the proposed nominee, relationships between the
recommending stockholder and the proposed nominee and the
qualifications of the proposed nominee to serve as director,
describing the contributions that the nominee would be expected
to make to the Board. The recommendation must also be
accompanied by the consent of the proposed nominee to serve if
nominated and the agreement of the nominee to be interviewed by
the Nominating Committee, if the Nominating Committee decides in
its discretion to do so. Selection of 2005 Nominees Six of the nominees listed on the accompanying proxy card are
currently serving on our Board and are standing for reelection.
The new nominee was recommended to our Nominating Committee by
Ms. Redstone, a non-management director. We did not receive
any recommendations from stockholders for nominees that are
required to be identified in this proxy statement. Stockholder Communications with Directors Stockholders may communicate with our Board of Directors, any
committee of the Board or any individual director, and any
interested party may communicate with our Chairman of the Board
or the non-management directors of the Board, by following the
procedures set forth below. Our acceptance and forwarding of
communications to the directors does not imply that the
directors owe or assume duties to persons submitting the
communications, the duties of the directors being only those
prescribed by applicable law, our By-laws or our policies
adopted by the Board. All communications should be delivered either in writing

    and is submitting the communication to our Chairman of the Board
    or to our non-management directors as an interested party, the
    nature of the person’s interest in us; • any special interest, meaning an interest not in the capacity as
    a stockholder of ours, of each person in the subject matter of
    the communication; and • the address, telephone number and any e-mail address of the
    person submitting the communication. 10 Table of Contents It is not appropriate to send, and we may decline to forward,
the following types of communications to directors: • communications regarding individual grievances or other
    interests that are personal to the party submitting the
    communication and could not reasonably be construed to be of
    concern to our stockholders or other constituencies generally; • communications that advocate our engaging in illegal activities; • communications that, under community standards, contain
    offensive, scurrilous or abusive content; and • advertisements, solicitations, form letters and communications
    that have no reasonable relevance to our business or operations. All communications that comply with the requirements that are
described here will be relayed to the person or persons to whom
they are addressed. Communications addressed to directors may,
at the direction of the addressees, be shared with Company
management. Director Attendance at Annual Meetings Each of our directors is expected to be present at our annual
meetings of stockholders, absent exigent circumstances that
prevent his or her attendance. Where a director is unable to
attend an annual meeting in person but is able to do so by
electronic conferencing, we will arrange for the director’s
participation by means where the director can hear, and be
heard, by those present at the meeting. At last year’s

    dated as of May 6, 2003, which provides that, on each
    occasion prior to May 6, 2005 that we issue additional
    shares of our common stock, we must grant to Mr. Zucker an
    additional option to purchase shares of our common stock in an
    amount equal to (a) 3.23% of the shares so issued, for
    issuances prior to May 6, 2004, and (b) the percentage
    of the shares so issued determined by dividing (x) the
    number of shares then issuable under unexercised options held by
    Mr. Zucker immediately prior to the issuance by
    (y) the number of shares of common stock outstanding
    immediately prior to the issuance, for issuances on or after
    May 6, 2004. The options vest in quarterly installments
    through May 1, 2007. The following table sets forth information about the exercise of

Record Date, was approximately $9.89 per share. See
“Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management” above for information about options held by
officers and directors of Midway. Summary of Stock Option Plans We have adopted a 2002 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, a 2002
Stock Option Plan, a 2000 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, a
1999 Stock Option Plan, a 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, a 1998
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan and a 1996 Stock Option Plan.
The plans are intended to encourage stock ownership by these
participants and thereby enhance their identification with our
stockholders’ interests. Subject to the provisions of the
plans, the Compensation Committee determines which of the
eligible directors, officers, employees, consultants and
advisors receive stock options, the terms including applicable
vesting periods of the options, and the number of shares for
which options are granted. The exercise price per share for each
option is determined by the Compensation Committee and generally
is not less than 100% of the fair market value of our common
stock on the date the option is granted. The Plans each have a
term of ten years, unless terminated earlier. We adopted a salary and director fee reduction/stock option
program under the 2002 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan.
Employees and Directors who elected to participate in the
program reduced their base salary or director’s fee. For
each dollar of salary or fee reduction, participants were
granted options to purchase one and one-half shares of our
common stock at an exercise price of $5.29. The options are
exercisable until September 2, 2012. We also assumed the options outstanding under the stock option
plan of Inevitable Entertainment Inc. on October 5, 2004 in
connection with our acquisition of Inevitable. For a discussion of Mr. Zucker’s stock options and
restricted stock agreement, see “Employment
Agreements” below. If our 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan is ratified at the annual
meeting, no further grants will be made under any of our current
plans, and future grants will be made under the 2005 Long-Term
Incentive Plan instead. Outstanding options will not be
affected. See “Proposal 2” below for information
about the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Senior Employee Bonus Incentive Plan Our executive officers and other senior employees are eligible
for participation in the Amended and Restated Midway Incentive
Plan, which was amended by the Board on March 10, 2005. The
plan offers 17 Table of Contents participants the opportunity to receive bonuses based on a
combination of the following factors: (1) a percentage of
each participant’s base salary determined by management;
(2) the achievement of targets set by management for
Midway’s financial performance; and
(3) management’s evaluation of the degree to which a
participant meets individual performance goals. No bonuses were
awarded under the plan in 2004. Even if Midway does not meet
performance targets for 2005, participants may receive part of
their bonus based on achieving their individual performance
goals. REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION FOR FISCAL 2004 The Compensation Committee, either as a Committee or together
with other independent directors as directed by the Board of
Directors, is responsible for determining the compensation of
our Chief Executive Officer and for making recommendations to
the Board of Directors regarding the compensation of our other
executive officers. Prior to June 10, 2004, to the extent
that stock options formed a portion of a compensation package,
the Compensation Committee worked together with the Stock Option
Committee, which was responsible for making stock option grants
and awards. The functions of the two committees have been
combined, and the Stock Option Committee was terminated on
June 10, 2004. It is the policy of the Compensation Committee to provide
attractive compensation packages to executive officers so as to
motivate them to devote their full energies to our business, to
reward them for their services and to align the interests of
senior management with the interests of stockholders. Our
executive compensation packages are comprised primarily of base
salaries, annual contractual and discretionary cash bonuses,
stock options and awards, and retirement and other benefits. It
is the philosophy of the Compensation Committee that Midway be
staffed with a small number of well-compensated executive
officers. In establishing compensation levels, we consider
compensation paid by our principal competitors. In general, the level of base salary is intended to provide
appropriate basic pay to executive officers taking into account
their historical contributions to our business, each
person’s unique education, skills and value, the
recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer and the
competitive marketplace for executive talent. The amount of any discretionary bonus is subjective but is
generally based on our actual financial performance in the
preceding fiscal year, the special contribution of the executive
to this performance and the overall level of the
executive’s compensation including other elements of the
compensation package. Contractual bonuses are likewise designed
to give effect to one or more of these factors. For fiscal years
beginning in 2003 and thereafter, we adopted the Midway
Incentive Plan. In view of the fact that we were not profitable
in 2004, no bonuses were awarded to our executive officers under
the Plan and no discretionary bonuses were awarded. The
Compensation Committee is currently exploring designating a
portion of the potential bonus payable under the Plan for 2005
to be based on an individual’s performance against his or
her goals irrespective of our profitability. Generally, the Compensation Committee determines the size of
stock option grants to our executive officers on an individual,
discretionary basis in consideration of financial corporate
results and each recipient’s performance, contributions and
responsibilities without assigning specific weight to any of
these factors. We also have used stock options, which increase
in value only if our common stock increases in value, and which
terminate a short time after an executive leaves our employ, as
a means of long-term incentive compensation. During 2004, no
options were granted to executive officers other than to David
Zucker, our Chief Executive Officer, as required under his
employment agreement. The Compensation Committee used the
services of an outside consultant to develop the 2005 Long-Term
Incentive Plan, pursuant to which a broad range of equity based
and non-equity based awards could be granted to and earned by
executives based upon performance over a period of time to
reward annual, intermediate and long term performance and
encourage retention. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan was
approved by the Board of directors on March 10, 2005 and is
being submitted to stockholders for ratification at our annual
meeting. 18 Table of Contents Mr. Zucker’s compensation arrangements are provided
for under his employment agreement dated May 6, 2003,
including stock option grants and restricted stock awards. His
employment agreement was negotiated at arm’s length by the
Compensation Committee, with the assistance of an outside
consultant. Among other matters, in negotiating this agreement
we considered compensation levels of chief executives at our
principal competitors. The agreement had an initial term of two
years expiring May 6, 2005, and automatically renews
thereafter for successive one year periods until terminated. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the “Budget
Act”) generally provides that publicly-held corporations
will only be able to deduct, for income tax purposes,
compensation paid to the chief executive officer or any of the
four most highly paid senior executive officers in excess of one
million dollars per year if it is paid pursuant to qualifying
performance-based compensation plans approved by stockholders.
Compensation as defined by the Budget Act includes, among other
things, base salary, incentive compensation and gains on stock
option transactions. Total compensation of some of our officers
may be paid under plans or agreements that have not been
approved by stockholders and may exceed one million dollars in a
particular fiscal year. We will not be able to deduct these
excess payments for income tax purposes. The Compensation
Committee intends to consider, on a case by case basis, how the
Budget Act will affect our compensation plans and contractual
and discretionary cash compensation, taking into account, among
other matters, our substantial net operating loss carryforwards. Respectfully submitted by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors. William C. Bartholomay, Chairman Kenneth

June 30, 1999 and ending December 31, 2004, the
percentage change during each period ending on the dates shown
below in cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock
with that of (1) the Standard and Poor’s 500 Stock
Index (“S&P 500”) and (2) the Standard and
Poor’s Leisure Time Index (“S&P Leisure”).
The graph assumes an investment of $100 on July 1, 1999 in
our common stock and $100 invested at that time in each of the
indices and the reinvestment of dividends where applicable. Note
that our fiscal year changed in 2001 from a fiscal year ending
on June 30 to a fiscal year ending on December 31.
Therefore, the data shown at December 31, 2001 reflects the
six-month period ended on December 31, 2001. 06/30/99 06/30/00 06/30/01 12/31/01 12/31/02 12/31/03 12/31/04 Midway $ 100.00 $ 63.32 $ 143.00 $ 116.02 $ 32.23 $ 29.99 $ 81.16 S&P 500 $ 100.00 $ 107.25 $ 91.34 $ 86.26 $ 67.20 $ 86.48 $ 95.89 S&P Leisure $ 100.00 $ 53.83 $ 71.42 $ 68.16 $ 67.86 $ 84.93 $ 94.60 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS We employ David F. Zucker as our President and Chief Executive
Officer under the terms of an Employment Agreement dated
May 6, 2003. Mr. Zucker’s base salary is
$600,000 per year. The agreement provides for bonus
compensation of up to 100% of his base salary each year, based
upon financial and other performance criteria mutually agreed to
annually between Mr. Zucker and the Board of Directors. The
agreement had an initial term of two years ending May 6,
2005 and automatically renews thereafter for successive one-year
periods until terminated. The employment agreement also provides that Mr. Zucker may
participate in and receive the benefits of any disability,
hospitalization, insurance, medical service or other
health-related employee benefit plan, or any pension or
retirement plan, that is generally available to executive
employees, including the Exec-U-Care insurance program. The employment agreement will terminate automatically upon
Mr. Zucker’s death. We may terminate the employment
agreement if Mr. Zucker is disabled for 120 consecutive
business days, or for six months in any 12-month period, and is
not able to resume his duties within 30 days of our giving
him notice of our intention to terminate his employment. 20 Table of Contents The employment agreement may be terminated by Mr. Zucker
upon the occurrence, without his consent or acquiesce, of any of
the following events: • a breach by us of any material provision of the agreement,
    including representations and warranties, after notice in
    writing and a cure period of ten days; • any material diminution or reduction in Mr. Zucker’s
    duties, whether in scope or nature, or Mr. Zucker is
    required to report to anyone other than the Board of Directors
    or any committee of the Board of the Directors; • the Board of Directors elects an executive officer senior in
    rank to Mr. Zucker; or • our principal place of business is moved more than
    50 miles, and as a result, Mr. Zucker’s commute
    to work is increased by more than 50 miles each way. In any of these events or if we are deemed to have wrongfully
terminated Mr. Zucker’s employment, we are obligated
to pay Mr. Zucker: • his base salary through his termination date, within
    30 days after the date of termination; • within 30 days after we publicly announce our audited
    results for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, his
    prorated bonus through the date of termination; and • an amount equal to two times his base salary in effect on the
    date of termination, payable 25% on the date of termination, and
    an additional 25% on each of 121 days, 242 days and
    365 days thereafter. Instead of the payments described above, if there were a change
of control by reason of the individuals who presently constitute
the Board of Directors, or successors approved by these Board
members, cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority
of the Board and Mr. Zucker elects to terminate his
employment because he is not offered the opportunity to continue
as Chief Executive Officer on the terms of his employment
agreement or the change of control were to occur within three
months after we wrongfully terminate Mr. Zucker or he
terminates his employment because of one of the occurrence of
one of the events described above, then we would be obligated to
pay to Mr. Zucker a lump sum payment equal to 2.99 times
(x) one year’s base salary at the rate of
$600,000 per year and (y) the bonus payable to
Mr. Zucker for the fiscal year immediately prior to the
change of control. In addition, all unexpired and unvested
options to purchase securities or restricted securities would
immediately vest on the date of the change in control. Mr. Zucker has agreed not to compete with us during his
employment and for a period of one year after termination of his
employment for any reason. If any portion of the amount paid to Mr. Zucker is subject
to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal
Revenue Code, then we must pay additional compensation to
Mr. Zucker to the extent necessary to eliminate the
economic effect on him of the resulting excise tax. Under the employment agreement, on May 6, 2003
Mr. Zucker was granted 10-year non-qualified options to
purchase 1,500,000 shares of our common stock at an
exercise price of $3.57 per share and was issued 125,000
restricted shares of our common stock. The option covering 1,000,000 shares out of the 1,500,000
is subject to the terms of a stock option agreement dated
May 6, 2003 and provides that the option may be exercised
for up to 62,500 shares on or after November 1, 2004
and the remaining 937,500 shares become exercisable in ten
equal quarterly installments on the first day of each February,
May, August and November thereafter. The option agreement also
provides that whenever we issue additional shares of our common
stock prior to May 6, 2005, we grant him an additional
option to purchase shares of our common stock in an amount
(a) equal to 3.23% of the shares so issued prior to
May 6, 2004, and (b) after May 6, 2004 and until
May 6, 2005, equal to the percentage of the shares so
issued (but not to exceed 3.23%) determined by dividing
(x) the number of shares then issuable under unexercised
options held by Mr. Zucker immediately prior to the 21 Table of Contents issuance by (y) the number of outstanding shares of common
stock immediately prior to the issuance. In each case, the
exercise price of each additional option will be the closing
price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the option.
In no event, however can the shares subject to additional
options exceed 2,250,000. The additional options are subject to
the same quarterly vesting schedule. Through April 18,
2005, we issued additional options to Mr. Zucker to
purchase up to 1,177,562 shares at exercise prices ranging
from $2.92 per share to $12.85 per share under this
provision. The option with respect to the other 500,000 shares is
subject to our 2002 Stock Option Plan and is fully exercisable.
The 125,000 restricted shares were issued under an agreement
dated May 6, 2003, as amended. Under the agreement, 52,082
of the shares are now vested, and the restrictions on the
remaining 72,918 shares will lapse on May 1, 2006. If
Mr. Zucker’s employment is terminated by Midway for
“cause” or by Mr. Zucker without “good
reason”, as defined in the agreement, then Mr. Zucker
will forfeit the shares for which the restrictions have not
lapsed. If Mr. Zucker’s employment is terminated for
any other reason, the restrictions will lapse in approximately
equal quarterly installments until May 1, 2006. We employed Kenneth J. Fedesna as Executive Vice
President — Product Development under the terms of an
agreement dated as of June 1, 1999. This agreement provided
for salaried compensation at the rate of $325,000 per year.
The agreement was subject to automatic extensions so that the
term of Mr. Fedesna’s employment would at no time be
less than three years. Mr. Fedesna’s employment with
us terminated effective June 11, 2004. The severance
agreement between Mr. Fedesna and us required us to pay
Mr. Fedesna $975,000, continue to pay for his health
benefits through June 30, 2007, continue to pay for
$400,000 of additional life insurance for him through June 2007
and that his 37,500 unvested stock options with an exercise
price of $2.35 immediately vested and shall remain exercisable
through June 2007. We employ Thomas E. Powell as Executive Vice
President — Finance, Treasurer and Chief Financial
Officer under the terms of an agreement dated March 21,
2001 as amended. His current base annual salary is $321,360. The
agreement also provides for, among other things, full
participation in all benefit plans and perquisites generally
available to executive employees. In addition, pursuant to the
terms of our agreement with Mr. Powell dated
February 10, 2003, if a change of control occurs within
5 years from the date of the agreement, and within
2 years thereafter Mr. Powell’s employment is
terminated (a) by Midway without cause, (b) by
Mr. Powell due to the relocation of his office location
more than 50 miles from its present location, or
(c) by Mr. Powell due to his placement in a position
of lesser stature or the assignment of duties at variance with
his current duties, then Mr. Powell will receive
twenty-four months of severance payments at his then current
salary rate. We employ Mark S. Beaumont as our Senior Vice
President — Entertainment. His current base annual
salary is $284,000. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with
Mr. Beaumont dated February 10, 2003, if a change of
control occurs within 5 years from the date of the
agreement, and within 2 years thereafter,
Mr. Beaumont’s employment is terminated (a) by
Midway without cause, (b) by Mr. Beaumont due to the
relocation of his office location more than 50 miles from
its present location, or (c) by Mr. Beaumont due to
his placement in a position of lesser stature or the assignment
of duties at variance with his current duties, then
Mr. Beaumont will receive twenty-four months of severance
payments at his then current salary rate. We employ Steven M. Allison as Senior Vice President —
Marketing and Chief Marketing Officer under the terms of an
agreement dated December 3, 2003. His current base annual
salary is $290,000. The agreement also provides for, among other
things, full participation in all benefit plans and perquisites
generally available to executive employees. Under the agreement,
if we terminate Mr. Allison’s employment without cause
prior to December 22, 2005, and he relocates his residence
to Southern California within six months after the termination,
then we must reimburse him for up to $100,000 of his actual
reasonable expenses of relocation. Also, if we terminate
Mr. Allison’s employment without cause, we must pay
him severance equal to six months’ salary. 22 Table of Contents CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Relationship with Former Parent Company In 1996, Midway sold common stock in an initial public offering.
After the offering, Midway’s parent company, WMS Industries
Inc., continued to own 86.8% of Midway’s common stock until
1998, when WMS distributed all of its remaining Midway stock to
its stockholders (the “Spinoff”). WMS has not owned
any Midway common stock since the Spinoff. Three of our
directors, Messrs. Bach, Bartholomay and Sheinfeld, are
also directors of WMS, but after the annual meeting, only
Mr. Bartholomay and Mr. Sheinfeld will serve on both
boards. Until the Spinoff, Midway was a member of the consolidated group
of corporations of which WMS was the common parent for federal
income tax purposes. Therefore, Midway was jointly and severally
liable for any federal tax liability of the WMS group for the
period during which it was part of the WMS group. WMS and Midway
entered into several agreements regarding the allocation of
these tax liabilities between Midway and WMS. These agreements
consisted of (w) a Tax Sharing Agreement dated July 1,
1996; (x) a Tax Separation Agreement dated April 6,
1998; (y) a Letter Agreement dated September 24, 2001;
and (z) a Settlement Agreement dated August 11, 2003. On November 19, 2004, the parties terminated these
agreements in settlement of a disagreement between them
concerning the interpretation of the “change of
control” provisions in the agreements relating to
Mr. Redstone’s accumulation of a majority interest in
Midway common stock. Under the terms of the settlement, all four
tax agreements were terminated, and Midway paid to WMS the
amount of $1,500,000. Additional details of the terms of the
four agreements were as follows: The Tax Sharing Agreement provided a method for:
(a) determining the amount that Midway must pay to WMS in
respect of federal income taxes; (b) compensating any
member of the WMS group for use of its net operating losses, tax
credits and other tax benefits in arriving at the WMS group tax
liability as determined under the federal consolidated return
regulations; and (c) providing for the receipt of any
refund arising from a carryback of net operating losses or tax
credits from subsequent taxable years and for payments upon
subsequent adjustments. The Tax Separation Agreement set forth the parties’
respective liabilities for federal, state and local taxes, among
other things, including: (a) the filing of tax returns with
federal, state and local authorities; (b) the carryover of
any tax benefits of Midway; (c) the treatment of the
deduction attributable to the exercise of WMS stock options held
by employees or former employees of Midway and any other similar
compensation related tax deductions; (d) the treatment of
net operating loss carrybacks; (e) the treatment of audit
adjustments; and (f) procedures with respect to any claim
made by any taxing authority with respect to a tax liability of
Midway or any of its subsidiaries. Under the 2001 letter agreement, WMS paid $2.8 million to
Midway relating to the exercise of WMS stock options by Midway
employees after the Spinoff, because Midway’s original
benefit was extinguished by Midway’s post-Spinoff net
operating loss carryback to its post-Spinoff profitable years.
Under the 2003 settlement agreement, WMS paid a
$4.0 million advance to Midway because net operating loss
carry-backs of WMS from post-Spinoff years to pre-Spinoff years
prevented Midway from realizing tax benefits of carrying back
its post-Spinoff net operating losses to pre-Spinoff years. The
$2.8 million, and $3.7 million of the
$4.0 million, were repayable by Midway under the agreements
upon a “change of control” of Midway, among other
circumstances. Other Related Party Transactions Mr. Bartholomay, a member of our Board of Directors, is
Group Vice Chairman of Willis Group Holdings, Ltd. and Vice
Chairman of Willis North America, Inc., insurance brokers which
we retain to provide insurance brokerage services. Our controlling stockholder, Sumner M. Redstone, is the
controlling stockholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Viacom and a director of Blockbuster, formerly a majority-owned
subsidiary of 23 Table of Contents Viacom. National Amusements is the parent company of Viacom.
Shari E. Redstone, one of our directors, is
Mr. Redstone’s daughter, President of National
Amusements and a director of National Amusements and Viacom.
Mr. Califano, one of our directors, is also a director of
Viacom. During fiscal 2004, Blockbuster purchased approximately
$9.2 million of videogames from us, we paid approximately
$6.6 million for advertisements on various cable networks
owned by Viacom and we paid $0.1 million for in-theater
advertising to National Amusements. We believe that all of these
transactions were on terms no less favorable to Midway than we
would have obtained from parties who have no ownership interest
in us. Mr. Sheinfeld, a member of our Board of Directors, is a
member of the law firm of Hogan & Hartson L.L.P., which
we retained in fiscal 2004 to provide tax services. Mr. Brown, a nominee for election to our Board of Directors
at the annual meeting, is the Chairman of the Board, Chief
Executive Officer and President of AMC Entertainment Inc., which
operates movie theater chains. He is also the Co-Chairman of the
Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Movietickets.com, Inc.,
together with Ms. Redstone. National Amusements and AMC
Entertainment entered into a joint venture agreement in February
2000 with another company to form MovieTickets.com. Viacom
also own interests in MovieTickets.com. National Amusements and
MovieTickets.com each transact business with Viacom. PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF 2005 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE
PLAN At the annual meeting, stockholders will be asked to ratify the
Midway Games Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2005
Plan”), which was approved by our Board of Directors on
March 10, 2005. The effective date of the 2005 Plan will be
the date it is approved by our stockholders. If approved by our
stockholders, the 2005 Plan will replace all of our stock option
plans (the “Preexisting Plans”), and no further shares
or options will be granted under the Preexisting Plans. Awards
previously issued under any Preexisting Plan, however, will
remain in effect and be subject to the terms of the applicable
Preexisting Plan. For more information about our Preexisting
Plans, see “Executive Compensation — Stock Option
Plans” above. The 2005 Plan would not make any new shares of common stock
available for equity awards. However, all of the shares
currently available for awards under any of the Preexisting
Plans will be available for awards under the 2005 Plan. As of
the Record Date, there were approximately 2.2 million
shares currently available for awards under the Preexisting
Plans, representing 2.4% of our shares outstanding. As of the
Record Date, there were approximately 5.4 million shares
subject to outstanding options under the Preexisting Plans,
representing 5.9% of our shares outstanding. Shares subject to
outstanding awards under any of the Preexisting Plans may become
available under the 2005 Plan if the shares are not delivered to
the participant, in accordance with share counting rules
explained below under the caption “Share Counting.” Assuming no change in the number of shares and equity awards
outstanding, upon approval of the 2005 Plan, the total number of
shares of our common stock that will be subject to outstanding
awards and available for future awards under the 2005 Plan and
the Preexisting Plans will be approximately 7.6 million
shares, or 8.0% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.
In addition, as of the Record Date, options to purchase shares
of our common stock granted to David Zucker outside of the
Preexisting Plans, in connection with his Employment Agreement,
together with options under a plan assumed from an acquired
business, total approximately 2.2 million. If those options
expire unexercised, they will not be available for awards under
the 2005 Plan. If the 2005 Plan is approved, the total number of
shares available for awards under the 2005 Plan, together with
those subject to outstanding awards under the Preexisting Plans
and those described in the preceding sentence total
approximately 9.8 million shares, or 10.1% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock. The Board and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”)
believe that attracting and retaining executives, other key
employees, non-employee directors and key consultants of high
quality has been and will continue to be essential to our growth
and success. The 2005 Plan will assist us in implementing a 24 Table of Contents compensation program with a broad range of incentives for
motivating our employees, officers, directors and consultants
and encouraging them to use their best efforts on our behalf.
Stock options, restricted stock, cash incentives and
stock-related awards are an important element of compensation
for employees and directors, because such awards enable them to
benefit from our success and thereby promote a closer identity
of their interests with those of our stockholders.
Performance-based awards provide rewards for achieving specific
performance objectives. The ability to grant such awards as
compensation under the 2005 Plan will help us to remain
competitive and provide an increased incentive for each person
granted an award to expend his or her maximum efforts for
achieving the success of our business. The Board and Committee
therefore view the 2005 Plan as being in our best interests. Reasons for Stockholder Ratification The Board seeks stockholder ratification of the 2005 Plan in
order to satisfy the NYSE requirement that equity compensation
plans be submitted to stockholders for their approval.
Stockholder ratification is also necessary in order to preserve
our ability to claim tax deductions for compensation paid, to
the greatest extent allowable under the tax laws. In addition,
stockholder approval will permit designated stock options to
qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue
Code. Such qualification can give the holder of the options more
favorable tax treatment, as explained below. Description of the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan The following is a brief description of the features of the 2005
Plan. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of the 2005 Plan, a copy of which is attached
to this proxy statement as Appendix C . Overview of 2005 Plan Awards The 2005 Plan authorizes a broad range of awards, including: • stock options; • stock appreciation rights (“SARs”); • restricted stock (a grant of actual shares subject to a risk of
    forfeiture and restrictions on transfer); • deferred stock (a contractual commitment to deliver shares at a
    future date; if such a grant is forfeitable, it may be referred
    to as “restricted stock units”); • other awards based on our common stock; • dividend equivalents; • performance shares or other stock-based performance awards,
    which are in effect deferred stock or restricted stock awards
    that may be earned by achieving specific performance objectives; • cash-based performance awards tied to achievement of specific
    performance objectives; and • shares issuable in lieu of rights to cash compensation. Restriction on Repricing Consistent with the requirements of the NYSE, the 2005 Plan
includes a restriction providing that, without stockholder
approval, we will not amend or replace options previously
granted under the 2005 Plan in a transaction that constitutes a
“repricing.” NYSE rules define a “repricing”
as amending the terms of an option after it is granted to lower
its exercise price, any other action that is treated as a
repricing under generally accepted accounting principles, and
canceling an option at a time when its strike price is equal to
or greater than the fair market value of the underlying stock,
in exchange for another option (including on a delayed basis),
restricted stock, or other equity, unless the cancellation and
exchange occurs in connection with a merger, acquisition,
spin-off or other similar corporate transaction. Adjustments to
the exercise price or number of shares subject to an option to
reflect the effects of a stock split or other extraordinary
corporate transaction will not constitute a
“repricing.” 25 Table of Contents Description of the 2005 Plan Eligibility. Employees, non-employee directors, advisors
and consultants of ours or our subsidiaries or affiliates will
be eligible for awards under the 2005 Plan. Any person who is
offered employment will also be eligible but cannot receive any
benefit under his or her award until after beginning employment
with us or a subsidiary or affiliate. Presently, approximately
700 employees and 7 non-employee directors would be eligible for
awards under the 2005 Plan, if it were in effect. Shares Reserved Under the 2005 Plan. If the 2005 Plan is
approved by our stockholders, shares reserved for new grants
under the Preexisting Plans (approximately 2.1 million as
of April 18, 2005), plus shares “recaptured” from
outstanding awards under the Preexisting Plans that expire
unexercised or are terminated, will be available for awards
under the 2005 Plan. On April 18, 2005, the closing sale price of our common
stock was $9.92 per share. Share Counting. The 2005 Plan provides share counting
rules that govern how shares are counted against the number
reserved. If any award made under the 2005 Plan or any
Preexisting Plan expires unexercised or is forfeited, the shares
subject to such award will remain available under the 2005 Plan.
In addition, shares withheld in payment of the exercise price or
taxes relating to an award or Preexisting Plan award and shares
equal to the number surrendered in payment of any exercise price
or taxes relating to an award or Preexisting Plan award shall be
deemed to constitute shares not delivered to the participant and
shall be deemed to be available for awards under the 2005 Plan. Per-Person Award Limitations. The 2005 Plan includes a
limitation on the amount of awards that may be granted to any
one participant in a given year in order to qualify awards as
“performance-based” compensation not subject to the
limitation on deductibility under Code Section 162(m).
Under this annual per-person limitation, no participant may in
any year be granted share-denominated awards under the 2005 Plan
relating to more than his or her “Annual Limit” for
each type of award. The Annual Limit equals 500,000 shares
plus the amount of the participant’s unused Annual Limit
relating to share-based awards as of the close of the previous
year, subject to adjustment for splits and other extraordinary
corporate events. In the case of cash-denominated awards, the
2005 Plan limits performance awards that may be earned by a
participant to the participant’s defined Annual Limit,
which for this purpose equals $1 million plus the amount of
the participant’s unused cash Annual Limit as of the close
of the previous year. The per-person limit for cash-denominated
performance awards does not operate to limit the amount of
share-based awards, and vice versa. All of these per-person
limits apply only to awards under the 2005 Plan and do not limit
our ability to enter into compensation arrangements outside of
the 2005 Plan. Adjustments. The Plan authorizes the Committee to make
equitable adjustments to the number and kind of shares subject
to the share limitations, including the total shares reserved
and available and individual participants’ share-based
Annual Limits in the event of a recapitalization, forward or
reverse split, stock dividend, reorganization, merger,
consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, share
exchange, special and non-recurring dividend or distribution
(whether in the form of cash or property other than stock),
liquidation, dissolution or other similar corporate transaction
or event affecting the common stock. In the case of outstanding
awards, the Committee must adjust such awards upon the
occurrence of these types of events so as to preserve, without
enlarging, the rights of participants. Such adjustments may
include appropriate changes to exercise prices or other award
terms, in addition to changes in the number and kind of shares
subject to the award. The Committee is also authorized to adjust
performance conditions and other terms of awards in response to
these kinds of events or to changes in applicable laws,
regulations, or accounting principles, except that adjustments
to awards intended to qualify as “performance-based”
generally must conform to requirements imposed by
Section 162(m). Administration. The 2005 Plan will be administered by the
Committee, except that the Board may itself act to administer
the 2005 Plan. The Board must perform the functions of the
Committee for purposes of granting awards to non-employee
directors. References to the “Committee” herein mean
the Committee or the Board exercising authority with respect to
a given award. Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2005
Plan, the Committee is authorized to select participants,
determine the type and 26 Table of Contents number of awards to be granted and the number of shares to which
awards will relate or the amount of a performance award, specify
times at which awards will be exercisable or settled, including
performance conditions that may be required as a condition
thereof, set other terms and conditions of such awards,
prescribe forms of award agreements, interpret and specify rules
and regulations relating to the 2005 Plan, and make all other
determinations which may be necessary or advisable for the
administration of the 2005 Plan. In addition, the Committee may
delegate its authority under the 2005 Plan to the extent
permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, except
delegation is limited with respect to awards to executive
officers where necessary to meet requirements under
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or
Code Section 162(m). Nothing in the 2005 Plan precludes the
Committee from authorizing payment of other compensation,
including bonuses based upon performance, to officers and
employees, including the executive officers, outside of the 2005
Plan. The 2005 Plan provides that Committee members shall not be
personally liable, and shall be fully indemnified, in connection
with any action, determination, or interpretation taken or made
in good faith under the 2005 Plan. Stock Options and SARs. The Committee is authorized to
grant stock options, including both incentive stock options
(“ISOs”), which can result in potentially favorable
tax treatment to the participant, and non-qualified stock
options. SARs may also be granted, entitling the participant to
receive the excess of the fair market value of a share on the
date of exercise over the SAR’s designated “base
price.” The exercise price of an option and the base price
of an SAR are determined by the Committee, but generally may not
be less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of
grant except as described below under “Other Terms of
Awards”. The maximum term of each option or SAR will be
ten years. Subject to this limit, the times at which each option
or SAR will be exercisable and provisions requiring forfeiture
of unexercised options or SARs (and in some cases gains realized
by exercise of the award) at or following termination of
employment or upon the occurrence of other events generally are
fixed by the Committee. Options may be exercised by payment of
the exercise price in cash, shares having a fair market value
equal to the exercise price or surrender of outstanding awards
or other property having a fair market value equal to the
exercise price, as the Committee may determine. This may include
withholding of option shares to pay the exercise price. The
Committee also is permitted to establish procedures for
broker-assisted cashless exercises. Methods of exercise and
settlement and other terms of SARs will be determined by the
Committee. SARs may be exercisable for shares or for cash, as
determined by the Committee. Options and stock SARs may be
granted on terms that cause such awards not to be subject to
Code Section 409A. Alternatively, such awards and cash SARs
may have terms that cause those awards to be deemed deferral
arrangements subject to Code Section 409A. The Committee
may require that outstanding options be surrendered in exchange
for a grant of SARs with economically equivalent terms. Restricted and Deferred Stock. The Committee is
authorized to grant restricted stock and deferred stock. Prior
to the end of the restricted period, shares granted as
restricted stock may not be sold and will be forfeited in the
event of termination of employment in specified circumstances.
The Committee will establish the length of the restricted period
for awards of restricted stock, except that the following
minimum vesting requirements will apply: If the grant or vesting
of restricted stock is subject to performance conditions, the
award will have a minimum performance-vesting period of one
year. Such awards may vest on an accelerated basis in the event
of death, disability, or retirement, or a change in control or
other special circumstances. Aside from the risk of forfeiture
and non-transferability, an award of restricted stock entitles
the participant to the rights of a stockholder of ours,
including the right to vote the shares and to receive dividends,
unless otherwise determined by the Committee. Deferred stock gives a participant the right to receive shares
at the end of a specified deferral period. Deferred stock
subject to forfeiture conditions may be denominated as an award
of “restricted stock units.” The Committee will
establish any vesting requirements for deferred stock granted
for continuing services. One advantage of deferred stock, as
compared to restricted stock, is that the period during which
the award is deferred as to settlement can be extended past the
date the award becomes non-forfeitable, so the Committee can
require or permit a participant to continue to hold an interest
tied to common stock on a tax-deferred basis. Prior to
settlement, deferred stock awards carry no voting or dividend
rights or other 27 Table of Contents rights associated with stock ownership, but dividend equivalents
will be paid or accrue if authorized by the Committee. Other Stock-Based Awards, Stock Bonus Awards, and Awards in
Lieu of Other Obligations. The 2005 Plan authorizes the
Committee to grant awards that are denominated or payable in,
valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based
on or related to common stock. The Committee will determine the
terms and conditions of such awards, including the consideration
to be paid to exercise awards in the nature of purchase rights,
the periods during which awards will be outstanding, and any
forfeiture conditions and restrictions on awards. In addition,
the Committee is authorized to grant shares as a bonus free of
restrictions, or to grant shares or other awards in lieu of
obligations under the 2005 Plan or other plans or compensatory
arrangements, subject to such terms as the Committee may specify. Performance-Based Awards. The Committee may grant
performance awards, which may be cash-denominated awards or
share-based awards. Generally, performance awards require
satisfaction of pre-established performance goals, consisting of
one or more business criteria and a targeted performance level
with respect to such criteria as a condition to awards being
granted or becoming exercisable or settleable, or as a condition
to accelerating the timing of such events. Performance may be
measured over a period of any length specified by the Committee.
If so determined by the Committee, in order to avoid the
limitations on tax deductibility under Section 162(m) of
the Code, the performance will be measured over a period of at
least one year. The business criteria used by the Committee in
establishing performance goals applicable to performance awards
to the named executive officers will be selected from among the
following: (1) Earnings (net of or including dividends),
(2) EBIT or EBITDA, (3) gross or net revenue or
changes in annual revenues; (4) Cash flow(s) (including
operating or net cash flow(s)); (5) financial return
ratios; (6) total shareholder return, shareholder return
based on growth measures or the attainment by the shares of a
specified value for a specified period of time, share price or
share price appreciation; (7) earnings growth or EPS
growth; (8) return measures, including return or net return
on assets, net assets, equity, capital or gross sales;
(9) adjusted pre-tax margin; (10) pre-tax profits;
(11) operating margins, operating profits; and/or operating
expenses; (12) dividends; (13) net income or net
operating income; (14) growth in operating earnings or
growth in EPS; (15) value of assets; (16) market share
or market penetration with respect to specific designated
products or product groups and/or specific geographic areas;
(17) aggregate product price and other product measures;
(18) expense or cost levels; (19) reduction of losses,
loss ratios or expense ratios; (20) reduction in fixed
costs; (21) operating cost management; (22) cost of
capital; (23) debt reduction; (24) productivity
improvements; (25) average inventory turnover;
(26) satisfaction of specified business expansion goals or
goals relating to acquisitions or divestitures;
(27) advertising efficiency; (28) customer
satisfaction based on specified objective goals or a
Company-sponsored customer survey; (29) employee diversity
goals or employee turnover; (30) specified objective social
goals; (31) safety record; (32) management of
employment practices and employee benefits;
(33) supervision of litigation and information technology;
and (34) goals relating to acquisitions or divestitures of
subsidiaries or joint ventures. These goals may be set with fixed, quantitative targets, targets
relative to past Company performance, or targets compared to the
performance of other companies, such as a published or special
index or a group of companies selected by the Committee for
comparison. They may also be based upon generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) or may be non-GAAP
measures, and in either case may be adjusted for purchase
accounting impacts related to acquisitions and other
extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual events or accounting
treatments. Annual Incentive Awards. One type of performance award
that may be granted under the 2005 Plan is annual incentive
awards, settleable in cash or in shares (or a combination of the
two) upon achievement of preestablished performance objectives
achieved during a specified period of one year or more. The
Committee generally must establish the terms of annual incentive
awards, including the applicable performance goals and the
corresponding amounts payable (subject to per-person limits),
and other terms of settlement, and all other terms of these
awards, not later than 90 days after the beginning of the
fiscal year. As stated above, annual incentive awards granted to
named executives are intended to constitute
“performance-based compensation” not subject to the
limitation on deductibility under Code Sec- 28 Table of Contents tion 162(m). In order for such an annual incentive award to
be earned, one or more of the performance objectives described
in the preceding paragraph will have to be achieved. The
Committee may specify additional requirements for the earning of
such awards. Other Terms of Awards. Awards may be settled in cash,
shares, other awards or other property, in the discretion of the
Committee. The Committee may require or permit participants to
defer the settlement of all or part of an award, including
shares issued upon exercise of an option subject to compliance
with Code Section 409A, in accordance with such terms and
conditions as the Committee may establish, including payment or
crediting of interest or dividend equivalents on any deferred
amounts. The Committee is authorized to place cash, shares or
other property in trusts or make other arrangements to provide
for payment of our obligations under the 2005 Plan, but is also
authorized to make no such arrangements. The Committee may
condition awards on the payment of taxes, and may provide for
mandatory or elective withholding of a portion of the shares or
other property to be distributed in order to satisfy tax
obligations. Awards granted under the 2005 Plan generally may
not be pledged or otherwise encumbered and are not transferable
except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or to
a designated beneficiary upon the participant’s death,
except that the Committee may permit transfers of awards other
than incentive stock options on a case-by-case basis. This
flexibility can allow for estate planning and other kinds of
transfers consistent with the incentive purpose of the 2005 Plan. Awards under the 2005 Plan may be granted without a requirement
that the participant pay consideration in the form of cash or
property for the grant (as distinguished from the exercise),
except to the extent required by law. The Committee may,
however, grant awards in substitution for, exchange for or as a
buyout of other awards under the 2005 Plan, awards under other
Company plans, or other rights to payment from us, and may
exchange or buy out outstanding awards for cash or other
property. The Committee also may grant awards in addition to and
in tandem with other awards or rights. In granting a new award,
the Committee may determine that the in-the-money value or fair
value of any surrendered award may be applied to reduce the
exercise price of any option, base price of any SAR, or purchase
price of any other award. Terms of Awards set by the Committee, including exercise prices,
performance conditions and vesting conditions, generally will be
reflected in award agreements between us and the participant. Dividend Equivalents. The Committee may grant dividend
equivalents. These are rights to receive payments equal in value
to the amount of dividends paid on a specified number of shares
of common stock while an award is outstanding. These amounts may
be in the form of cash or rights to receive additional awards or
additional shares of common stock having a value equal to the
cash amount. The awards may be granted on a stand-alone basis or
in conjunction with another award. Typically, rights to dividend
equivalents are granted in connection with deferred stock, so
that the participant can earn amounts equal to dividends paid on
the number of shares covered by the award while the award is
outstanding. Forfeiture of Award Gains. The 2005 Plan contains certain
restrictions, including non-compete, non-solicitation and
non-disclosure provisions, that govern the behavior of
participants (other than non-employee directors) during their
employment with us and for 12 months after termination of
their employment. Compliance with these restrictions is a
pre-condition to a participant’s right to realize and
retain any gain from awards under the 2005 Plan. In the event
that a participant fails to comply with these restrictions (a
“Forfeiture Event”), we have the right to recover all
gains derived from 2005 Plan-based awards realized by that
participant at any time after the date six months prior to the
Forfeiture Event or, after termination of employment, six months
prior to the participant’s termination of employment, and
to cancel any outstanding awards. The Committee has discretion
to waive or modify our right to forfeiture, or to include
additional forfeiture provisions in the agreement governing any
2005 Plan award. Change in Control. Unless otherwise provided in any award
agreement, if a Change in Control of Midway occurs, awards with
service-based vesting terms will become immediately vested and
fully exercisable, and vested awards that are deferred as to
settlement will be settled. In addition, the Committee may
compel a cash settlement or permit a participant to elect to
receive a cash settlement equal to the intrinsic value of any
equity awards held by the participant. Performance conditions of
awards 29 Table of Contents will be deemed met only to the extent specified in the award
agreement. Awards subject to Code Section 409A in some
cases will be subject to a requirement that the Change in
Control event also constitutes a “change in ownership or
effective control” of Midway under a new IRS definition,
and Code Section 409A may impose other limitations on the
rights of participants holding options and stock SARs. If
applicable, a “Change in Control” will be defined by
the Committee and included within each applicable award document. Amendment and Termination of the 2005 Plan. The Board may
amend, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the 2005 Plan or the
Committee’s authority to grant awards thereunder without
stockholder approval, except as required by law or regulation or
under the NYSE rules. NYSE rules now require shareholder
approval of any material revision to a plan such as the 2005
Plan. Under these rules, however, shareholder approval will not
necessarily be required for amendments that might increase the
cost of the 2005 Plan. Unless earlier terminated, the authority
of the Committee to make grants under the 2005 Plan will
terminate ten years after the latest stockholder approval of the
2005 Plan, and the 2005 Plan will terminate when no shares
remain available and we have no further obligation with respect
to any outstanding award. Federal Income Tax Implications of the 2005 Plan We believe that under current law the following Federal income
tax consequences generally would arise with respect to awards
under the 2005 Plan. Options and SARs that are not deemed to be deferral arrangements
under Code Section 409A would have the following tax
consequences: The grant of the option or SAR will create no
federal income tax consequences for the participant or us. A
participant will not have taxable income upon exercising an
option that is an ISO, except that the alternative minimum tax
may apply. Upon exercising an option that is not an ISO, the
participant generally must recognize ordinary income equal to
the difference between the exercise price and the fair market
value of the freely transferable and nonforfeitable shares
acquired on the date of exercise. Upon exercising an SAR, the
participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to
the cash or the fair market value of the shares received. Upon a disposition of shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO
before the end of the applicable ISO holding periods, the
participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to
the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the ISO shares
at the date of exercise minus the exercise price or
(ii) the amount realized upon the disposition of the ISO
shares minus the exercise price. Otherwise, a participant’s
sale of shares acquired by exercise of an option generally will
result in short-term or long-term capital gain or loss measured
by the difference between the sale price and the
participant’s tax “basis” in such shares. The tax
“basis” normally is the exercise price plus any amount
he or she recognized as ordinary income in connection with the
option’s exercise. A participant’s sale of shares
acquired by exercise of an SAR generally will result in
short-term or long-term capital gain or loss measured by the
difference between the sale price and the tax “basis”
in the shares, which generally is the amount he or she
recognized as ordinary income in connection with the SAR’s
exercise. We normally can claim a tax deduction equal to the amount
recognized as ordinary income by a participant in connection
with an option or SAR, but no tax deduction relating to a
participant’s capital gains. Accordingly, we will not be
entitled to any tax deduction with respect to an ISO if the
participant holds the shares for the applicable ISO holding
periods before selling the shares. An option or SAR with deferral features or other features may be
subject to Code Section 409A, which applies to deferral
arrangements. In such case, the distribution to the participant
of shares relating to the award would have to meet certain
restrictions in order for the participant not to be subject to
tax and a tax penalty at the time of vesting. One significant
restriction would be a requirement that the distribution not be
controlled by the participant’s discretionary exercise of
the option or SAR. If the distribution and other award terms
meet applicable requirements under Section 409A, the
participant would realize ordinary income at the time of
distribution rather than earlier, with the amount of ordinary
income equal to the distribution date value of the shares less
any exercise price actually paid. We would 30 Table of Contents not be entitled to a tax deduction at the time of exercise, but
would become entitled to a tax deduction at the time shares are
delivered at the end of the deferral period. Awards other than options and SARs that result in a transfer to
the participant of cash or shares or other property generally
will be structured under the 2005 Plan to meet applicable
requirements under Code Section 409A. If no restriction on
transferability or substantial risk of forfeiture applies to
amounts distributed to a participant, the participant generally
must recognize ordinary income equal to the cash or the fair
market value of shares actually received. Thus, for example, if
we grant an award of deferred stock that has vested or require
or permit deferral of receipt of cash or shares under a vested
award, the participant should not become subject to income tax
until the end of the deferral period, and our right to claim a
tax deduction will be likewise deferred. On the other hand, if a
restriction on transferability and substantial risk of
forfeiture applies to shares or other property actually
distributed to a participant under an award (such as, for
example, a grant of restricted stock), the participant generally
must recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of
the transferred amounts at the earliest time either the
transferability restriction or risk of forfeiture lapses. In all
cases, we can claim a tax deduction in an amount equal to the
ordinary income recognized by the participant, except as
discussed below. A participant may elect to be taxed at the time
of grant of restricted stock or other property rather than upon
lapse of restrictions on transferability or the risk of
forfeiture, but if the participant subsequently forfeits such
shares or property he or she would not be entitled to any tax
deduction, including as a capital loss, for the value of the
shares or property on which he or she previously paid tax. Any award that is deemed to be a deferral arrangement (excluding
certain exempted short-term deferrals) will be subject to Code
Section 409A. Certain participant elections and the timing
of distributions relating to such awards must meet requirements
under Section 409A in order for income taxation to be
deferred and tax penalties avoided by the participant upon
vesting of the award. As discussed above, compensation that qualifies as
“performance-based” compensation is excluded from the
$1 million deductibility cap of Code Section 162(m),
and therefore remains fully deductible by the company that pays
it. Under the 2005 Plan, options and SARs granted with an
exercise price or base price at least equal to 100% of fair
market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant,
annual incentive awards to employees the Committee expects to be
named executive officers at the time compensation is received,
and certain other awards which are conditioned upon achievement
of performance goals are intended to qualify as such
“performance-based” compensation. A number of
requirements must be met in order for particular compensation to
so qualify, however, so there can be no assurance that such
compensation under the 2005 Plan will be fully deductible under
all circumstances. In addition, other awards under the 2005 Plan
generally will not so qualify, so that compensation paid to
certain executives in connection with such awards, to the extent
it and other compensation subject to Section 162(m)’s
deductibility cap exceed $1 million in a given year, may
not be deductible by us as a result of Section 162(m). The foregoing provides only a general description of the
application of federal income tax laws to certain awards under
the 2005 Plan. This discussion is intended for the information
of stockholders considering how to vote at the Meeting and not
as tax guidance to participants in the 2005 Plan, as the
consequences may vary with the types of awards made, the
identity of the recipients and the method of payment or
settlement. Different tax rules may apply, including in the case
of variations in transactions that are permitted under the 2005
Plan (such as payment of the exercise price of an option by
surrender of previously acquired shares). The summary does not
address the effects of other federal taxes (including possible
“golden parachute” excise taxes) or taxes imposed
under state, local, or foreign tax laws. New Plan Benefits Under the 2005 Plan Because future awards under the 2005 Plan will be granted in the
discretion of the Committee, the type, number, recipients, and
other terms of such awards cannot be determined at this time.
Information regarding our recent practices with respect to
incentive awards and stock-based compensation under the similar
Preexisting Plans is presented in the “Summary Compensation
Table” elsewhere in this proxy 31 Table of Contents statement and in our financial statements for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2004, in the Annual Report that
accompanies this proxy statement. We have made no commitments for awards under the 2005 Plan. If
the 2005 Plan is not ratified, our Preexisting Plans will remain
in effect. Vote Required for Ratification Our Board of Directors believes the 2005 Long-Term Incentive
Plan to be in our best interests and recommends that the
stockholders ratify the 2005 Plan. We will submit the following
resolution to the stockholders for ratification at the annual
meeting: “RESOLVED, that the Corporation’s 2005 Long-Term
Incentive Plan be, and it hereby is, ratified, approved and
adopted in all respects; and that the Corporation is authorized
to issue awards under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan in
accordance with its terms.” The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of
our common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to
vote on this proposal is required for ratification of the 2005
Long-Term Incentive Plan; provided that the total vote cast on
the proposal must represent a majority of all outstanding shares
of our common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
“FOR” THE RATIFICATION OF THE 2005 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE
PLAN. PROPOSAL 3: APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS We propose that the stockholders ratify the appointment by our
Audit Committee of Ernst & Young LLP,
independent registered public accountants, as our independent
auditors for fiscal 2005, ending December 31, 2005. We
expect that representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will
be present at the annual meeting and that they will be available
to respond to appropriate questions submitted by stockholders at
the meeting. Ernst & Young LLP will have the
opportunity to make a statement at the meeting if they desire to
do so. Fees of Independent Auditors Ernst & Young LLP served as our independent auditors
for fiscal 2004 and 2003. Aggregate fees billed by
Ernst & Young LLP for professional services rendered
and for other professional services billed in fiscal years 2004
and 2003, were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Audit Fees(1) $ 604,325 $ 303,900 Audit-Related Fees(2) 18,000 162,590 Tax Fees(3) — 30,970 All Other Fees — — Total $ 622,325 $ 497,460 (1) Comprised of the audit of our annual consolidated financial
    statements, internal control attestation services required in
    2004 to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
    review of financial statements included in our Form 10-Qs
    and other services provided by the accountant in connection with
    statutory and regulatory filings. (2) Comprised of 401(K) audit procedures, accounting consultations,
    and assistance with responses to Securities and Exchange
    Commission comment letters in 2003. (3) Comprised of tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning
    services. 32 Table of Contents Pre-approval Policies and Procedures Consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission
requirements regarding auditor independence, our Audit Committee
has adopted a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible
non-audit services provided by our independent auditor. Under
the policy, the Audit Committee, or a designated member thereof,
must pre-approve non-audit services prior to the commencement of
the specified service. The approval by any member of the Audit
Committee must be presented to the full Audit Committee at the
next regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting. Our
independent auditors verify to our Audit Committee annually that
they have not performed and will not perform any prohibited
non-audit services. Percentage of Services Approved Under S-X
    Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) None. The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of
our common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to
vote on this proposal is required for ratification of the
selection of our independent auditors. Ratification by the
stockholders of the appointment of independent auditors is not
required, but the Board believes that it is desirable to submit
this matter to the stockholders. If holders of a majority of our
common stock present in person or by proxy did not approve the
selection of Ernst & Young LLP at the meeting, the
selection of independent auditors would be reconsidered.
However, Mr. Redstone has indicated to us that he will vote
in favor of this proposal, so its passage is assured. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
“FOR” THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF
ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS. AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Midway is
composed of four independent directors and operates under a
written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. On
June 10, 2004 Messrs. McKenna and White retired from
the Audit Committee, and Messrs. Bach and Califano joined
the Committee. On March 10, 2005, upon the recommendation
of the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors revised the Audit
Committee’s charter, and a copy of the revised charter is
included as Appendix A to this proxy statement. Management is responsible for Midway’s internal accounting
controls, assessing the effectiveness of internal controls over
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements.
Midway’s independent registered public accountants,
Ernst & Young LLP, are responsible for performing
audits of (a) Midway’s consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the auditing standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
(b) Midway’s internal control over financial
reporting, (c) management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and
(d) issuing audit reports thereon. The Audit
Committee’s responsibility is to monitor, review and
oversee these processes. In keeping with that responsibility, the Audit Committee has
reviewed and discussed Midway’s audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004,
its internal control over financial reporting and
management’s assessment thereof with both management and
Midway’s independent accountants. In addition, the Audit
Committee has discussed with the independent accountants the
matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing
Standards No. 61, “Communications with Audit
Committees.” The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written
disclosures and the letter from the independent accountants
required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1,
“Independence Discussions with Audit Committees,” and
has discussed with the independent accountants their
independence. The Audit Committee has also considered whether
the provision of non-audit services by the independent
accountant is consistent with maintaining auditor independence. 33 Table of Contents Based on these discussions and reviews, the Audit Committee
recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited
consolidated financial statements be included in Midway’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors: Robert N. Waxman (Chairman) Harold H. Bach, Jr. William C. Bartholomay Joseph A. Califano, Jr. OTHER MATTERS Stockholder Proposals As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board has not
received notice of, and does not intend to propose, any other
matters for stockholder action. However, if any other matters
are properly brought before the meeting, it is intended that the
persons voting the accompanying proxy will vote the shares
represented by the proxy in accordance with their best judgment. We must receive any stockholder proposals of matters to be acted
upon at our 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on or before
December 27, 2005 to consider including them in our proxy
materials for that meeting. If we do not receive notice of a
stockholder proposal to be acted upon at our 2006 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders on or before March 11, 2006, our proxy for
that meeting may confer discretionary authority to vote on any
such proposal. Further, if any stockholders wish to recommend
nominations to be considered by our Nominating Committee prior
to our 2006 annual meeting, such recommendations must be made
following the procedures described above under “Nominating
Committee Policies” and in Appendix B to this
proxy statement. In order for a stockholder proposal or nomination to be acted
upon at an annual meeting, notice of stockholder proposals must
be delivered to us between 60 and 90 days prior to the
annual meeting (or, if no public disclosure of the date of the
meeting has been made at least 70 days before the meeting,
then not more than ten days after such disclosure). The notice
must contain the information required under Article I,
Section 13 of our By-laws. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting
Compliance Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more
than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities,
to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the
SEC. These persons are required by regulation to furnish us with
copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file. Based
on our review of the copies of these reports received by us, or
written representations from the reporting persons that no
Form 5 was required for those persons, we believe that,
during fiscal 2004, all filing requirements applicable to our
officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial
owners were complied with. Voting Procedures We will appoint inspectors of election to tabulate the number of
shares of common stock represented at the meeting in person or
by proxy, to determine whether or not a quorum is present and to
count all votes cast at the meeting. The inspectors of election
will treat abstentions and broker non-votes as shares that are
present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum. Votes withheld in connection with the
election of one or more of the nominees for director will not be
counted in determining the votes cast and will have no effect on
the outcome of the vote. With respect to the tabulation of votes
cast on a specific proposal presented to the stockholders at the
meeting, abstentions will be considered as present and entitled
to vote with respect to that specific proposal, whereas broker
non-votes will not be considered as present and entitled to vote
with respect to that specific proposal. 34 Table of Contents Therefore, abstentions will have the effect of a vote against
each proposal, but broker non-votes will have no effect on the
vote for or against each proposal. In addition, under NYSE
rules, with respect to any proposal that is a prerequisite to
listing of additional or new securities, the total vote cast on
the proposal must represent at least a majority of all
outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the
proposal. Since Mr. Redstone controls a majority of our
outstanding voting shares, his vote will decide each proposal.
The term “broker non-votes” commonly refers to shares
held in street name for customers, where the broker does not
have authority under NYSE rules to vote on its own initiative on
particular items, and the broker has not received instructions
from the beneficial owners. At the annual meeting, brokers will
have the authority to vote on Proposals 1 and 3 but not
proposal 2. How to Obtain Our Annual Report on Form 10-K We will provide without charge a copy of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004,
including financial statements and schedules, to each of our
stockholders of record on April 18, 2005 and each
beneficial owner of our common stock on that date, upon receipt
of a written request mailed to our offices, 2704 West Roscoe
Street, Chicago, IL 60618, attention: Miguel Iribarren. In the
event that exhibits to the Forms 10-K are requested, a
reasonable fee will be charged for reproduction of the exhibits.
Please note that you can view and print our recent
Forms 10-K, including exhibits, on our website at www.investor.midway.com or at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Requests from beneficial owners of common
stock must set forth a good faith representation as to their
ownership. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting in person, you
are requested to mark, date, sign and return your proxy in the
enclosed envelope. No postage need be affixed if mailed in the
United States. You may revoke the proxy at any time before it is
exercised. If you attend the meeting in person, you may withdraw
the proxy and vote your own shares. By Order of the Board of Directors, DEBORAH K.

    “Communication with Audit Committees.” 9. Before filing the Company’s annual report, obtain
    and review a report from the independent auditor concerning: all
    critical accounting policies and practices followed by the
    Company; all alternative treatments within generally accepted
    accounting principles for policies and practices related to

provisions of the Plan, to select Eligible Persons to become
Participants; to grant Awards; to determine the type and number
of Awards, the dates on which Awards may be exercised and on
which the risk of forfeiture or deferral period relating to
Awards shall lapse or terminate, the acceleration of any such
dates, the expiration date of any Award, whether, to what
extent, and under what circumstances an Award may be settled, or
the exercise price of an Award may be paid, in cash, Stock,
other Awards, or other property, and other terms and conditions
of, and all other matters relating to, Awards; to prescribe
documents evidencing or setting terms of Awards (such Award
documents need not be identical for each Participant),
amendments thereto, and rules and regulations for the
administration of the Plan and amendments thereto (including
outstanding Awards); to construe and interpret the Plan and
Award documents and correct defects, supply omissions or
reconcile inconsistencies therein; and to make all other
decisions and determinations as the Committee may deem necessary
or advisable for the administration of the Plan. Decisions of
the Committee with respect to the administration and
interpretation of the Plan shall be final, conclusive, and
binding upon all persons interested in the Plan, including
Participants, Beneficiaries, transferees under
Section 11(b) and other persons claiming rights from or
through a Participant, and stockholders. The foregoing
notwithstanding, the Board shall perform the functions of the
Committee for purposes of granting Awards under the Plan to
non-employee directors (the functions of the Committee with
respect to other aspects of non-employee director awards is not
exclusive to the Board, however). (b) Manner of Exercise of Committee Authority. The
express grant of any specific power to the Committee, and the
taking of any action by the Committee, shall not be construed as
limiting any power or authority of the Committee. The Committee
may act through subcommittees, including for purposes of
perfecting exemptions under Rule 16b-3 or qualifying Awards
under Code Section 162(m) as performance-based
compensation, in which case the subcommittee shall be subject to
and have authority under the charter applicable to the
Committee, and the acts of the subcommittee shall be deemed to
be acts of the Committee hereunder. The Committee may delegate
to officers or managers of the Company or any subsidiary, or
committees thereof, the authority, subject to such terms as the
Committee shall determine, to perform such functions, including
administrative functions, as the Committee may determine, to the
extent (i) that such delegation will not result in the loss
of an exemption under Rule 16b-3 for Awards granted to
Participants subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act in
respect of the Company and will not cause Awards intended to
qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Code
Section 162(m) to fail to so qualify, and
(ii) permitted under Section 157 and other applicable
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. (c) Limitation of Liability. The Committee and each
member thereof, and any person acting pursuant to authority
delegated by the Committee, shall be entitled, in good faith, to
rely or act upon any report or other information furnished by
any executive officer, other officer or employee of the Company
or a subsidiary, the Company’s independent auditors,
consultants or any other agents assisting in the administration
of the Plan. Members of the Committee, any person acting
pursuant to authority delegated by the Committee, and any
officer or employee of the Company or a subsidiary acting at the
direction or on behalf of the Committee or a delegee shall not
be personally liable for any action or determination taken or
made in good faith with respect to the Plan, and shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and protected by
the Company with respect to any such action or determination. 4. Stock Subject To Plan. (a) Overall Number of Shares Available for Delivery. The total number of shares of Stock reserved and available for
delivery in connection with Awards under the Plan shall be
(i) the number of shares that, immediately prior to the
Effective Date, remain available for new awards under all
Preexisting Plan, plus (ii) the number of shares subject to
awards under the Preexisting Plans which become available in
accordance with Section 4(b) after the Effective Date. Any
shares of Stock delivered under the Plan shall consist of
authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. C-3 Table of Contents (b) Share Counting Rules. The Committee may adopt
reasonable counting procedures to ensure appropriate counting,
avoid double counting (as, for example, in the case of tandem or
substitute awards) and make adjustments in accordance with this
Section 4(b). Shares that are potentially deliverable under
an Award under the Plan or an award under any Preexisting Plan
that are canceled, expired, forfeited, settled in cash or
otherwise terminated without a delivery of such shares to the
Participant will not be counted as delivered under the Plan or
such Preexisting Plan and shall be available for Awards under
this Plan. Shares that have been issued in connection with an
Award under this Plan (e.g., Restricted Stock) or any
Preexisting Plan award that is canceled, forfeited, or settled
in cash such that those shares are returned to the Company shall
be available for Awards under this Plan. Shares withheld in
payment of the exercise price or taxes relating to an Award or
Preexisting Plan award and shares equal to the number
surrendered in payment of any exercise price or taxes relating
to an Award or Preexisting Plan award shall be deemed to
constitute shares not delivered to the Participant and shall be
deemed to be available for Awards under this Plan. The foregoing
notwithstanding, if issued shares are returned to the Company,
including upon a cash out of Restricted Stock, surrender of
shares in payment of an exercise price or taxes relating to an
Award, or withholding of shares in payment of taxes upon vesting
of Restricted Stock, such shares shall not become available
again under the Plan if the transaction resulting in the return
of shares occurs more than ten years after the date of the most
recent shareholder approval of the Plan, and otherwise shares
shall not become available under this Section 4(b) in an
event that would constitute a “material revision” of
the Plan subject to shareholder approval under then applicable
rules of the New York Stock Exchange (if then applicable).
Because shares will count against the number reserved in
Section 4(a) upon delivery, and subject to the share
counting rules under this Section 4(b), the Committee may
determine that Awards may be outstanding that relate to a
greater number of shares than the aggregate remaining available
under the Plan, so long as Awards will not result in delivery
and vesting of shares in excess of the number then available
under the Plan. 5. Eligibility; Per-Person Award Limitations. (a) Eligibility. Awards may be granted under the
Plan only to Eligible Persons. For purposes of the Plan, an
“Eligible Person” means an employee of the Company or
any subsidiary, including any executive officer, non-employee
director, advisor or consultant of the Company or a subsidiary,
and any person who has been offered employment by the Company or
a subsidiary, provided that such prospective employee may not
receive any payment or exercise any right relating to an Award
until such person has commenced employment with the Company or a
subsidiary. An employee on leave of absence may be considered as
still in the employ of the Company or a subsidiary for purposes
of eligibility for participation in the Plan, if so determined
by the Committee. If so determined by the Committee, holders of
outstanding awards granted by a company or business acquired by
the Company or a subsidiary, or with which the Company or a
subsidiary combines, are eligible for grants under the Plan of
substitute awards either through assumption of such awards or
the grant of a substitute award in connection with such
acquisition or combination transaction. (b) Per-Person Award Limitations. In each calendar
year during any part of which the Plan is in effect, an Eligible
Person may be granted Awards under each of Section 6(b),
6(c), 6(d), 6(e), 6(f), 6(g) or 6(h) relating to up to his or
her Annual Limit (such Annual Limit to apply separately to the
type of Award authorized under each specified subsection, except
that the limitation applies to Dividend Equivalents under
Section 6(g) only if such Dividend Equivalents are granted
separately from and not as a feature of another Award). A
Participant’s Annual Limit, in any year during any part of
which the Participant is then eligible under the Plan, shall
equal 500,000 shares plus the amount of the
Participant’s unused Annual Limit relating to the same type
of Award as of the close of the previous year, subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 11(c). In the case of an
Award which is not valued in a way in which the limitation set
forth in the preceding sentence would operate as an effective
limitation satisfying applicable law (including Treasury
Regulation 1.162-27(e)(4)), an Eligible Person may not be
granted Awards authorizing the earning during any calendar year
of an amount that exceeds the Eligible Person’s Annual
Limit, which for this purpose shall equal $1 million plus
the amount of the Eligible Person’s unused cash Annual
Limit as of the close of the previous year (this limitation is
separate and not affected C-4 Table of Contents by the number of Awards granted during such calendar year
subject to the limitation in the preceding sentence). For this
purpose, (i) “earning” means satisfying
performance conditions so that an amount becomes payable,
without regard to whether it is to be paid currently or on a
deferred basis or continues to be subject to any service
requirement or other non-performance condition, and (ii) a
Participant’s Annual Limit is used to the extent an amount
or number of shares may be potentially earned or paid under an
Award, regardless of whether such amount or shares are in fact
earned or paid. (c) Non-Employee Director Awards. Non-employee
directors may be granted any type of Award under the Plan. 6. Specific Terms of Awards. (a) General. Awards may be granted on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Section 6. In addition, the
Committee may impose on any Award or the exercise thereof, at
the date of grant or thereafter (subject to Sections 11(e)
and 11(k)), such additional terms and conditions, not
inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee
shall determine, including terms requiring forfeiture of Awards
in the event of termination of employment or service by the
Participant and terms permitting a Participant to make elections
relating to his or her Award. The Committee shall retain full
power and discretion with respect to any term or condition of an
Award that is not mandatory under the Plan, subject to
Section 11(k). The Committee shall require the payment of
lawful consideration for an Award to the extent necessary to
satisfy the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, and may otherwise require payment of consideration for an
Award except as limited by the Plan. (b) Options. The Committee is authorized to grant
Options to Participants on the following terms and conditions: (i) Exercise Price. The exercise price per share of
    Stock purchasable under an Option (including both ISOs and
    non-qualified Options) shall be determined by the Committee,
    provided that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
    contrary such exercise price shall be (A) fixed as of the
    grant date, and (B) not less than the Fair Market Value of
    a share of Stock on the date of grant of such Option.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, any substitute award granted in
    assumption of or in substitution for an outstanding award
    granted by a company or business acquired by the Company or a
    subsidiary, or with which the Company or a subsidiary combines
    may be granted with an exercise price per share of Stock other
    than as required above. Without the approval of stockholders, the Committee will not
    amend or replace previously granted Options in a transaction
    that constitutes a “repricing,” as such term is used
    in Section 303A.08 of the Listed Company Manual of the New
    York Stock Exchange (if then applicable) or Item 402(i)(1)
    of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. (ii) Option Term; Time and Method of Exercise. The
    Committee shall determine the term of each Option, provided that
    in no event shall the term of any Option exceed a period of ten
    years from the date of grant. The Committee shall determine the
    time or times at which or the circumstances under which an
    Option may be exercised in whole or in part, provided that,
    notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
    sole and exclusive basis for determining both the vesting and
    exercisability of an option will be the passage of a specific
    period of time or the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain
    specific events (which may include, but is not limited to, the
    achievement of performance goals and/or future service
    requirements). In addition, the Committee shall determine the
    methods by which such exercise price may be paid or deemed to be
    paid and the form of such payment (subject to
    Sections 11(k) and 11(l)), including, without limitation,
    cash, Stock (including by withholding Stock deliverable upon
    exercise, if such withholding or withholding feature will not
    result in additional accounting expense to the Company), other
    Awards or awards granted under other plans of the Company or any
    subsidiary, or other property (including through broker-assisted
    “cashless exercise” arrangements, to the extent
    permitted by applicable law), and the methods by or forms in
    which Stock will be delivered or deemed to be delivered in
    satisfaction of Options to Participants (including, in the case
    of 409A Awards, deferred delivery of shares subject to the
    Option, C-5 Table of Contents as mandated by the Committee, with such deferred shares subject
    to any vesting, forfeiture or other terms as the Committee may
    specify). (iii) ISOs. The terms of any ISO granted under the
    Plan shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Code
    Section 422. (c) Stock Appreciation Rights. The Committee is
authorized to grant SARs to Participants on the following terms
and conditions: (i) Right to Payment. An SAR shall confer on the
    Participant to whom it is granted a right to receive, upon
    exercise thereof, the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value
    of one share of Stock on the date of exercise (or, in the case
    of a “Limited SAR,” the Fair Market Value determined
    by reference to the Change in Control Price, as defined under
    the applicable award agreement) over (B) the grant price of
    the SAR as determined by the Committee. (ii) Other Terms. The Committee shall determine the
    term of each SAR, provided that in no event shall the term of an
    SAR exceed a period of ten years from the date of grant. The
    Committee shall determine at the date of grant or thereafter,
    the time or times at which and the circumstances under which a
    SAR may be exercised in whole or in part (including based on
    achievement of performance goals and/or future service
    requirements), the method of exercise, method of settlement,
    form of consideration payable in settlement, method by or forms
    in which Stock will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to
    Participants, whether or not a SAR shall be free-standing or in
    tandem or combination with any other Award, and whether or not
    the SAR will be a 409A Award or Non-409A Award (cash SARs will
    in all cases be 409A Awards). Limited SARs that may only be
    exercised in connection with a Change in Control or termination
    of service following a Change in Control as specified by the
    Committee may be granted on such terms, not inconsistent with
    this Section 6(c), as the Committee may determine. The
    Committee may require that an outstanding Option be exchanged
    for an SAR exercisable for Stock having vesting, expiration, and
    other terms substantially the same as the Option, so long as
    such exchange will not result in additional accounting expense
    to the Company. (iii) Without the approval of stockholders, the Committee
    will not amend or replace previously granted SARs in a
    transaction that constitutes a “repricing,” as such
    term is used in Section 303A.08 of the Listed Company
    Manual of the New York Stock Exchange (if then applicable). (d) Restricted Stock. The Committee is authorized to
grant Restricted Stock to Participants on the following terms
and conditions: (i) Grant and Restrictions. Restricted Stock shall
    be subject to such restrictions on transferability, risk of
    forfeiture and other restrictions, if any, as the Committee may
    impose, which restrictions may lapse separately or in
    combination at such times, under such circumstances (including
    based on achievement of performance goals and/or future service
    requirements), in such installments or otherwise and under such
    other circumstances as the Committee may determine at the date
    of grant or thereafter. Except to the extent restricted under
    the terms of the Plan and any Award document relating to the
    Restricted Stock, a Participant granted Restricted Stock shall
    have all of the rights of a stockholder, including the right to
    vote the Restricted Stock and the right to receive dividends
    thereon (subject to any mandatory reinvestment or other
    requirement imposed by the Committee). (ii) Forfeiture. Except as otherwise determined by
    the Committee, upon termination of employment or service during
    the applicable restriction period, Restricted Stock that is at
    that time subject to restrictions shall be forfeited and
    reacquired by the Company; provided that the Committee may
    provide, by rule or regulation or in any Award document, or may
    determine in any individual case, that restrictions or
    forfeiture conditions relating to Restricted Stock will lapse in
    whole or in part, including in the event of terminations
    resulting from specified causes. (iii) Certificates for Stock. Restricted Stock
    granted under the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the
    Committee shall determine. If certificates representing
    Restricted Stock are registered C-6 Table of Contents in the name of the Participant, the Committee may require that
    such certificates bear an appropriate legend referring to the
    terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to such Restricted
    Stock, that the Company retain physical possession of the
    certificates, and that the Participant deliver a stock power to
    the Company, endorsed in blank, relating to the Restricted Stock. (iv) Dividends and Splits. As a condition to the
    grant of an Award of Restricted Stock, the Committee may require
    that any dividends paid on a share of Restricted Stock shall be
    either (A) paid with respect to such Restricted Stock at the
    dividend payment date in cash, in kind, or in a number of shares
    of unrestricted Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the
    amount of such dividends, or (B) automatically reinvested
    in additional Restricted Stock or held in kind, which shall be
    subject to the same terms as applied to the original Restricted
    Stock to which it relates, or (C) deferred as to payment, either
    as a cash deferral or with the amount or value thereof
    automatically deemed reinvested in shares of Deferred Stock,
    other Awards or other investment vehicles, subject to such terms
    as the Committee shall determine or permit a Participant to
    elect. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, Stock
    distributed in connection with a Stock split or Stock dividend,
    and other cash or property distributed as a dividend, shall be
    subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to the same
    extent as the Restricted Stock with respect to which such Stock
    or other property has been distributed. (e) Deferred Stock. The Committee is authorized to
grant Deferred Stock to Participants, subject to the following
terms and conditions: (i) Award and Restrictions. Issuance of Stock will
    occur upon expiration of the deferral period specified for an
    Award of Deferred Stock by the Committee (or, if permitted by
    the Committee, as elected by the Participant). In addition,
    Deferred Stock shall be subject to such restrictions on
    transferability, risk of forfeiture and other restrictions, if
    any, as the Committee may impose, which restrictions may lapse
    at the expiration of the deferral period or at earlier specified
    times (including based on achievement of performance goals
    and/or future service requirements), separately or in
    combination, in installments or otherwise, and under such other
    circumstances as the Committee may determine at the date of
    grant or thereafter. Deferred Stock may be satisfied by delivery
    of cash, Stock, other Awards, or a combination thereof (subject
    to Section 11(l)), as determined by the Committee at the
    date of grant or thereafter. (ii) Forfeiture. Except as otherwise determined by
    the Committee, upon termination of employment or service during
    the applicable deferral period or portion thereof to which
    forfeiture conditions apply (as provided in the Award document
    evidencing the Deferred Stock), all Deferred Stock that is at
    that time subject to such forfeiture conditions shall be
    forfeited; provided that the Committee may provide, by rule or
    regulation or in any Award document, or may determine in any
    individual case, that restrictions or forfeiture conditions
    relating to Deferred Stock will lapse in whole or in part,
    including in the event of terminations resulting from specified
    causes. Deferred Stock subject to a risk of forfeiture may be
    called “restricted stock units” or otherwise
    designated by the Committee. (iii) Dividend Equivalents. Unless otherwise
    determined by the Committee, Dividend Equivalents on the
    specified number of shares of Stock covered by an Award of
    Deferred Stock shall be either (A) paid with respect to
    such Deferred Stock at the dividend payment date in cash or in
    shares of unrestricted Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to
    the amount of such dividends, or (B) deferred with respect
    to such Deferred Stock, either as a cash deferral or with the
    amount or value thereof automatically deemed reinvested in
    additional Deferred Stock, other Awards or other investment
    vehicles having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such
    dividends, as the Committee shall determine or permit a
    Participant to elect. (f) Bonus Stock and Awards in Lieu of Obligations. The Committee is authorized to grant Stock as a bonus, or to
grant Stock or other Awards in lieu of obligations of the
Company or a subsidiary to pay cash or deliver other property
under the Plan or under other plans or compensatory
arrangements, subject to such terms as shall be determined by
the Committee. C-7 Table of Contents (g) Dividend Equivalents. The Committee is
authorized to grant Dividend Equivalents to a Participant, which
may be awarded on a free-standing basis or in connection with
another Award. The Committee may provide that Dividend
Equivalents shall be paid or distributed when accrued or shall
be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Stock, Awards,
or other investment vehicles, and subject to restrictions on
transferability, risks of forfeiture and such other terms as the
Committee may specify. (h) Other Stock-Based Awards. The Committee is
authorized, subject to limitations under applicable law, to
grant to Participants such other Awards that may be denominated
or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or
otherwise based on, or related to, Stock or factors that may
influence the value of Stock, including, without limitation,
convertible or exchangeable debt securities, other rights
convertible or exchangeable into Stock, purchase rights for
Stock, Awards with value and payment contingent upon performance
of the Company or business units thereof or any other factors
designated by the Committee, and Awards valued by reference to
the book value of Stock or the value of securities of or the
performance of specified subsidiaries or other business units.
The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such
Awards. Stock delivered pursuant to an Award in the nature of a
purchase right granted under this Section 6(h) shall be
purchased for such consideration, paid for at such times, by
such methods, and in such forms, including, without limitation,
cash, Stock, other Awards, notes, or other property, as the
Committee shall determine. Cash awards, as an element of or
supplement to any other Award under the Plan, may also be
granted pursuant to this Section 6(h). (i) Performance Awards. Performance Awards,
denominated in cash or in Stock or other Awards, may be granted
by the Committee in accordance with Section 7. 7. Performance Awards. (a) Performance Awards Generally. Performance Awards
may be denominated as a cash amount, number of shares of Stock,
or specified number of other Awards or a combination of the
foregoing, which may be earned upon achievement or satisfaction
of performance conditions specified by the Committee. In
addition, the Committee may specify that any other Award shall
constitute a Performance Award by conditioning the right of a
Participant to exercise the Award or have it settled, and the
timing thereof, upon achievement or satisfaction of such
performance conditions as may be specified by the Committee. The
Committee may use such business criteria and other measures of
performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any
performance conditions, and may exercise its discretion to
reduce or increase the amounts payable under any Award subject
to performance conditions, except as limited under
Sections 7(b) and 7(c) in the case of a Performance Award
intended to qualify as “performance-based
compensation” under Code Section 162(m). (b) Performance Awards Granted to Covered Employees. If the Committee determines that a Performance Award to be
granted to an Eligible Person who is designated by the Committee
as likely to be a Covered Employee should qualify as
“performance-based compensation” for purposes of Code
Section 162(m), the grant, exercise and/or settlement of
such Performance Award shall be contingent upon achievement of a
preestablished performance goal and other terms set forth in
this Section 7(b). (i) Performance Goal Generally. The performance goal
    for such Performance Awards shall consist of one or more
    business criteria and a targeted level or levels of performance
    with respect to each of such criteria, as specified by the
    Committee consistent with this Section 7(b). The
    performance goal shall be objective and shall otherwise meet the
    requirements of Code Section 162(m) and regulations
    thereunder, including the requirement that the level or levels
    of performance targeted by the Committee result in the
    achievement of performance goals being “substantially
    uncertain.” The Committee may determine that such
    Performance Awards shall be granted, exercised and/or settled
    upon achievement of any one performance goal or that two or more
    of the performance goals must be achieved as a condition to
    grant, exercise and/or settlement of such Performance Awards.
    Performance goals may differ for Performance Awards granted to
    any one Participant or to different Participants. C-8 Table of Contents (ii) Business Criteria. One or more of the following
    business criteria for the Company, on a consolidated basis,
    and/or for specified subsidiaries or other business units of the
    Company shall be used by the Committee in establishing
    performance goals for such Performance Awards: (1) Earnings
    (net of or including dividends), (2) EBIT or EBITDA,
    (3) gross or net revenue or changes in annual revenues;
    (4) Cash flow(s) (including operating or net cash flow(s));
    (5) financial return ratios; (6) total shareholder
    return, shareholder return based on growth measures or the
    attainment by the shares of a specified value for a specified
    period of time, share price or share price appreciation;
    (7) earnings growth or EPS growth; (8) return
    measures, including return or net return on assets, net assets,
    equity, capital or gross sales; (9) adjusted pre-tax
    margin; (10) pre-tax profits; (11) operating margins,
    operating profits; and/or operating expenses;
    (12) dividends; (13) net income or net operating
    income; (14) growth in operating earnings or growth in EPS;
    (15) value of assets; (16) market share or market
    penetration with respect to specific designated products or
    product groups and/or specific geographic areas;
    (17) aggregate product price and other product measures;
    (18) expense or cost levels; (19) reduction of losses,
    loss ratios or expense ratios; (20) reduction in fixed
    costs; (21) operating cost management; (22) cost of
    capital; (23) debt reduction; (24) productivity
    improvements; (25) average inventory turnover; (26)
    satisfaction of specified business expansion goals or goals
    relating to acquisitions or divestitures; (27) advertising
    efficiency; (28) customer satisfaction based on specified
    objective goals or a Company-sponsored customer survey;
    (29) employee diversity goals or employee turnover; (30)
    specified objective social goals; (31) safety record;
    (32) management of employment practices and employee
    benefits; (33) supervision of litigation and information
    technology; and (34) goals relating to acquisitions or
    divestitures of subsidiaries or joint ventures. The targeted
    level or levels of performance with respect to such business
    criteria may be established at such levels and in such terms as
    the Committee may determine, in its discretion, including in
    absolute terms, as a goal relative to performance in prior
    periods, or as a goal compared to the performance of one or more
    comparable companies or an index covering multiple companies. (iii) Performance Period; Timing for Establishing
    Performance Goals. Achievement of performance goals in
    respect of such Performance Awards shall be measured over a
    performance period of one year or more, as specified by the
    Committee. A performance goal shall be established not later
    than the earlier of (A) 90 days after the beginning of
    any performance period applicable to such Performance Award or
    (B) the time 25% of such performance period has elapsed. (iv) Performance Award Pool. The Committee may
    establish a Performance Award pool, which shall be an unfunded
    pool, for purposes of measuring performance of the Company in
    connection with Performance Awards. The amount of such
    Performance Award pool shall be based upon the achievement of a
    performance goal or goals based on one or more of the business
    criteria set forth in Section 7(b)(ii) during the given
    performance period, as specified by the Committee in accordance
    with Section 7(b)(iii). The Committee may specify the
    amount of the Performance Award pool as a percentage of any of
    such business criteria, a percentage thereof in excess of a
    threshold amount, or as another amount which need not bear a
    strictly mathematical relationship to such business criteria. (v) Settlement of Performance Awards; Other Terms. Settlement of Performance Awards shall be in cash, Stock, other
    Awards or other property, in the Committee’s discretion.
    The Committee may, in its discretion, increase or reduce the
    amount of a settlement otherwise to be made in connection with
    such Performance Awards, but may not exercise discretion to
    increase any such amount payable to a Covered Employee in
    respect of a Performance Award subject to this
    Section 7(b). Any settlement which changes the form of
    payment from that originally specified shall be implemented in a
    manner such that the Performance Award and other related Awards
    do not, solely for that reason, fail to qualify as
    “performance-based compensation” for purposes of Code
    Section 162(m). The Committee shall specify the
    circumstances in which such Performance Awards shall be paid or
    forfeited in the event of termination of employment by a
    Participant or other event C-9 Table of Contents (including a Change in Control) prior to the end of a
    performance period or settlement of such Performance Awards. (c) Written Determinations. Determinations by the
Committee as to the establishment of performance goals, the
amount potentially payable in respect of Performance Awards, the
level of actual achievement of the specified performance goals
relating to Performance Awards, and the amount of any final
Performance Award shall be recorded in writing in the case of
Performance Awards intended to qualify under
Section 162(m). Specifically, the Committee shall certify
in writing, in a manner conforming to applicable regulations
under Section 162(m), prior to settlement of each such
Award granted to a Covered Employee, that the performance
objective relating to the Performance Award and other material
terms of the Award upon which settlement of the Award was
conditioned have been satisfied. 8. Certain Provisions Applicable To Awards. (a) Stand-Alone, Additional, and Tandem Awards. Awards granted under the Plan may, in the Committee’s
discretion, be granted either alone or in addition to, in tandem
with, or in substitution or exchange for, any other Award or any
award granted under another plan of the Company, any subsidiary,
or any business entity acquired by the Company or a subsidiary,
or any other right of a Participant to receive payment from the
Company or any subsidiary; provided, however, that a 409A Award
may not be granted in tandem with a Non-409A Award. Awards
granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards or awards
may be granted either as of the same time as or a different time
from the grant of such other Awards or awards. (b) Term of Awards. The term of each Award shall be
for such period as may be determined by the Committee, subject
to the express limitations set forth in Sections 6(b)(ii),
6(c)(ii) and 8 or elsewhere in the Plan. (c) Form and Timing of Payment under Awards;
Deferrals. Subject to the terms of the Plan (including
Sections 11(k) and (l)) and any applicable Award document,
payments to be made by the Company or a subsidiary upon the
exercise of an Option or other Award or settlement of an Award
may be made in such forms as the Committee shall determine,
including, without limitation, cash, Stock, other Awards or
other property, and may be made in a single payment or transfer,
in installments, or on a deferred basis. The settlement of any
Award may be accelerated, and cash paid in lieu of Stock in
connection with such settlement, in the Committee’s
discretion or upon occurrence of one or more specified events,
subject to Sections 6(b), 11(k) and 11(l). Subject to
Section 11(k), installment or deferred payments may be
required by the Committee (subject to Section 11(e)) or
permitted at Participant’s election on terms and conditions
established by the Committee. Payments may include, without
limitation, provisions for the payment or crediting of
reasonable interest on installment or deferred payments or the
grant or crediting of Dividend Equivalents or other amounts in
respect of installment or deferred payments denominated in
Stock. In the case of any 409A Award that is vested and no
longer subject to a risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of
Code Section 83), such Award will be distributed to the
Participant, upon application of the Participant, if the
Participant has had an unforeseeable emergency within the
meaning of Code Sections 409A(a)(2)(A)(vi) and
409A(a)(2)(B)(ii), in accordance with
Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii). 9. Change in Control. Upon a Change in Control (as
such term is defined in the applicable Award agreement or other
agreement between the Participant and the Company) all Awards
made under this Plan shall be governed by the terms and
conditions of the applicable Award or other agreement. 10. Additional Award Forfeiture Provisions. (a) Forfeiture of Options and Other Awards and Gains
Realized Upon Prior Option Exercises or Award Settlements. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, each Award granted
hereunder, other than Awards granted to non-employee directors,
shall be subject to the following additional forfeiture
conditions, to which the Participant, by accepting an Award
hereunder, agrees. If any of the events C-10 Table of Contents specified in Section 10(b)(i), (ii), or (iii) occurs
(a “Forfeiture Event”), all of the following
forfeitures will result: (i) The unexercised portion of the Option, whether or not
    vested, and any other Award not then settled (except for an
    Award that has not been settled solely due to an elective
    deferral by the Participant and otherwise is not forfeitable in
    the event of any termination of service of the Participant) will
    be immediately forfeited and canceled upon the occurrence of the
    Forfeiture Event; and (ii) The Participant will be obligated to repay to the
    Company, in cash, within five business days after demand is made
    therefor by the Company (but not earlier than termination of
    employment in the case of an equity award accounted for under
    APB 25), the total amount of Award Gain (as defined herein)
    realized by the Participant upon each exercise of an Option or
    settlement of an Award (regardless of any elective deferral)
    that occurred on or after (A) the date that is six months
    prior to the occurrence of the Forfeiture Event, if the
    Forfeiture Event occurred while the Participant was employed by
    the Company or a subsidiary, or (B) the date that is six
    months prior to the date the Participant’s employment by
    the Company or a subsidiary terminated, if the Forfeiture Event
    occurred after the Participant ceased to be so employed. For
    purposes of this Section, the term “Award Gain” shall
    mean (i), in respect of a given Option exercise, the product of
    (X) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock at the date of
    such exercise (without regard to any subsequent change in the
    market price of shares) minus the exercise price times
    (Y) the number of shares as to which the Option was
    exercised at that date, and (ii), in respect of any other
    settlement of an Award granted to the Participant, the Fair
    Market Value of the cash or Stock paid or payable to Participant
    (regardless of any elective deferral) less any cash or the Fair
    Market Value of any Stock or property (other than an Award or
    award which would have itself then been forfeitable hereunder
    and excluding any payment of tax withholding) paid by the
    Participant to the Company as a condition of or in connection
    such settlement. (b) Events Triggering Forfeiture. The forfeitures
specified in Section 10(a) will be triggered upon the
occurrence of any one of the following Forfeiture Events at any
time during Participant’s employment by the Company or a
subsidiary, or during the one-year period following termination
of such employment: (i) Participant, acting alone or with others, directly or
    indirectly, (A) engages, either as employee, employer,
    consultant, advisor, or director, or as an owner, investor,
    partner, stockholder, licensee or licensor unless
    Participant’s interest is insubstantial, in any business in
    an area or region in which the Company conducts business at the
    date the event occurs, which is directly in competition with a
    business then conducted by the Company or a subsidiary;
    (B) induces any customer, supplier, licensee or licensor of
    the Company or a subsidiary, with which the Company or a
    subsidiary has a business relationship, to curtail, cancel, not
    renew, or not continue his or her or its business with the
    Company or any subsidiary; or (C) induces, or attempts to
    influence, any employee, service provider, licensee or licensor
    to the Company or a subsidiary to terminate such employment or
    service. The Committee shall, in its discretion, determine which
    lines of business the Company conducts on any particular date
    and which third parties may reasonably be deemed to be in
    competition with the Company. For purposes of this
    Section 10(b)(i), a Participant’s interest as a
    stockholder is insubstantial if it represents beneficial
    ownership of less than five percent of the outstanding class of
    stock, and a Participant’s interest as an owner, investor,
    or partner is insubstantial if it represents ownership, as
    determined by the Committee in its discretion, of less than five
    percent of the outstanding equity of the entity; (ii) Participant discloses, uses, sells, or otherwise
    transfers, except in the course of employment with or other
    service to the Company or any subsidiary, any confidential or
    proprietary information of the Company or any subsidiary,
    including but not limited to information regarding the
    Company’s current and potential customers, organization,
    employees, finances, and methods of operations and investments,
    so long as such information has not otherwise been disclosed to
    the public or is not otherwise in the public domain (other than
    by Participant’s breach of this provision), except as C-11 Table of Contents required by law or pursuant to legal process, or Participant
    makes statements or representations, or otherwise communicates,
    directly or indirectly, in writing, orally, or otherwise, or
    takes any other action which may, directly or indirectly,
    disparage or be damaging to the Company or any of its
    subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors, employees,
    advisors, businesses or reputations, except as required by law
    or pursuant to legal process; or (iii) Participant fails to cooperate with the Company or
    any subsidiary in any way, including, without limitation, by
    making himself or herself available to testify on behalf of the
    Company or such subsidiary in any action, suit, or proceeding,
    whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, or
    otherwise fails to assist the Company or any subsidiary in any
    way, including, without limitation, in connection with any such
    action, suit, or proceeding by providing information and meeting
    and consulting with members of management of, other
    representatives of, or counsel to, the Company or such
    subsidiary, as reasonably requested. (c) Agreement Does Not Prohibit Competition or Other
Participant Activities. Although the conditions set forth in
this Section 10 shall be deemed to be incorporated into an
Award, a Participant is not, solely by reason of such
incorporation, thereby prohibited from engaging in any activity,
including but not limited to competition with the Company and
its subsidiaries. Rather, the non-occurrence of the Forfeiture
Events set forth in Section 10(b) is a condition to the
Participant’s right to realize and retain value from his or
her compensatory Options and Awards, and the consequence under
the Plan if the Participant engages in an activity giving rise
to any such Forfeiture Event are the forfeitures specified
herein. The Company and Participant shall not be precluded by
this provision or otherwise from entering into other agreements
concerning the subject matter of Sections 10(a) and 10(b). (d) Committee Discretion. The Committee may, in its
discretion, waive in whole or in part the Company’s right
to forfeiture under this Section, but no such waiver shall be
effective unless evidenced by a writing signed by a duly
authorized officer of the Company. In addition, the Committee
may impose additional conditions on Awards, by inclusion of
appropriate provisions in the document evidencing or governing
any such Award. 11. General Provisions. (a) Compliance with Legal and Other Requirements. The Company may, to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by
the Committee and subject to Section 11(k), postpone the
issuance or delivery of Stock or payment of other benefits under
any Award until completion of such registration or qualification
of such Stock or other required action under any federal or
state law, rule or regulation, listing or other required action
with respect to any stock exchange or automated quotation system
upon which the Stock or other securities of the Company are
listed or quoted, or compliance with any other obligation of the
Company, as the Committee may consider appropriate, and may
require any Participant to make such representations, furnish
such information and comply with or be subject to such other
conditions as it may consider appropriate in connection with the
issuance or delivery of Stock or payment of other benefits in
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, listing
requirements, or other obligations. The foregoing
notwithstanding, in connection with a Change in Control, the
Company shall take or cause to be taken no action, and shall
undertake or permit to arise no legal or contractual obligation,
that results or would result in any postponement of the issuance
or delivery of Stock or payment of benefits under any Award or
the imposition of any other conditions on such issuance,
delivery or payment, to the extent that such postponement or
other condition would represent a greater burden on a
Participant than existed on the 90th day preceding the Change in
Control. (b) Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries. No
Award or other right or interest of a Participant under the Plan
shall be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or
subject to any lien, obligation or liability of such Participant
to any party (other than the Company or a subsidiary thereof),
or assigned or transferred by such Participant otherwise than by
will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a Beneficiary
upon the death of a Participant, and such Awards or rights that
may be exercisable shall be exercised during the lifetime of the
Participant only by the Participant or his or her guardian or
legal representative, except that Awards and other rights (other
than ISOs and SARs in tandem therewith) may C-12 Table of Contents be transferred to one or more transferees during the lifetime of
the Participant, and may be exercised by such transferees in
accordance with the terms of such Award, but only if and to the
extent such transfers are permitted by the Committee, subject to
any terms and conditions which the Committee may impose thereon
(which may include limitations the Committee may deem
appropriate in order that offers and sales under the Plan will
meet applicable requirements of registration forms under the
Securities Act of 1933 specified by the Securities and Exchange
Commission). A Beneficiary, transferee, or other person claiming
any rights under the Plan from or through any Participant shall
be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award
document applicable to such Participant, except as otherwise
determined by the Committee, and to any additional terms and
conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee. (c) Adjustments. In the event that any large,
special and non-recurring dividend or other distribution
(whether in the form of cash or property other than Stock),
recapitalization, forward or reverse split, Stock dividend,
reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination,
repurchase, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or other
similar corporate transaction or event affects the Stock such
that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be
appropriate and, in the case of any outstanding Award, necessary
to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participant’s rights,
then the Committee shall, in an equitable manner as determined
by the Committee, adjust any or all of (i) the number and
kind of shares of Stock which may be delivered in connection
with Awards granted thereafter, (ii) the number and kind of
shares of Stock by which annual per-person Award limitations are
measured under Section 5, including the share limits
applicable to non-employee director Awards under
Section 5(c), (iii) the number and kind of shares of
Stock subject to or deliverable in respect of outstanding Awards
and (iv) the exercise price, grant price or purchase price
relating to any Award or, if deemed appropriate, the Committee
may make provision for a payment of cash or property to the
holder of an outstanding Option (subject to Section 11(l))
or other Award. In addition, the Committee is authorized to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria
included in, Awards (including Performance Awards and
performance goals and any hypothetical funding pool relating
thereto) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events
(including, without limitation, events described in the
preceding sentence, as well as acquisitions and dispositions of
businesses and assets) affecting the Company, any subsidiary or
other business unit, or the financial statements of the Company
or any subsidiary, or in response to changes in applicable laws,
regulations, accounting principles, tax rates and regulations or
business conditions or in view of the Committee’s
assessment of the business strategy of the Company, any
subsidiary or business unit thereof, performance of comparable
organizations, economic and business conditions, personal
performance of a Participant, and any other circumstances deemed
relevant; provided that no such adjustment shall be authorized
or made if and to the extent that the existence of such
authority (i) would cause Options, SARs, or Performance
Awards granted under the Plan to Participants designated by the
Committee as Covered Employees and intended to qualify as
“performance-based compensation” under Code
Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder to otherwise fail
to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under
Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder, or
(ii) would cause the Committee to be deemed to have
authority to change the targets, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation 1.162-27(e)(4)(vi), under the performance goals
relating to Options or SARs granted to Covered Employees and
intended to qualify as “performance-based
compensation” under Code Section 162(m) and
regulations thereunder. (d) Tax Provisions. (i) Withholding. The Company and any subsidiary is
    authorized to withhold from any Award granted, any payment
    relating to an Award under the Plan, including from a
    distribution of Stock, or any payroll or other payment to a
    Participant, amounts of withholding and other taxes due or
    potentially payable in connection with any transaction involving
    an Award, and to take such other action as the Committee may
    deem advisable to enable the Company and Participants to satisfy
    obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax
    obligations relating to any Award. This authority shall include
    authority to withhold or receive Stock or other property and to
    make cash payments in respect thereof in satisfaction of a
    Participant’s withholding obligations, either on a C-13 Table of Contents mandatory or elective basis in the discretion of the Committee,
    or in satisfaction of other tax obligations. Other provisions of
    the Plan notwithstanding, only the minimum amount of Stock
    deliverable in connection with an Award necessary to satisfy
    statutory withholding requirements will be withheld, unless
    withholding of any additional amount of Stock will not result in
    additional accounting expense to the Company. (ii) Required Consent to and Notification of Code
    Section 83(b) Election. No election under
    Section 83(b) of the Code (to include in gross income in
    the year of transfer the amounts specified in Code
    Section 83(b)) or under a similar provision of the laws of
    a jurisdiction outside the United States may be made unless
    expressly permitted by the terms of the Award document or by
    action of the Committee in writing prior to the making of such
    election. In any case in which a Participant is permitted to
    make such an election in connection with an Award, the
    Participant shall notify the Company of such election within ten
    days of filing notice of the election with the Internal Revenue
    Service or other governmental authority, in addition to any
    filing and notification required pursuant to regulations issued
    under Code Section 83(b) or other applicable provision. (iii) Requirement of Notification Upon Disqualifying
    Disposition Under Code Section 421(b). If any
    Participant shall make any disposition of shares of Stock
    delivered pursuant to the exercise of an ISO under the
    circumstances described in Code Section 421(b) (i.e., a
    disqualifying disposition), such Participant shall notify the
    Company of such disposition within ten days thereof. (e) Changes to the Plan. The Board may amend,
suspend or terminate the Plan or the Committee’s authority
to grant Awards under the Plan without the consent of
stockholders or Participants; provided, however, that any
amendment to the Plan shall be submitted to the Company’s
stockholders for approval not later than the earliest annual
meeting for which the record date is at or after the date of
such Board action if such stockholder approval is required by
any federal or state law or regulation or the rules of the New
York Stock Exchange (if then applicable) or any other stock
exchange or automated quotation system on which the Stock may
then be listed or quoted, or if such amendment would materially
increase the number of shares reserved for issuance and delivery
under the Plan, and the Board may otherwise, in its discretion,
determine to submit other amendments to the Plan to stockholders
for approval; and provided further, that, without the consent of
an affected Participant, no such Board action may materially and
adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any
outstanding Award (for this purpose, actions that alter the
timing of federal income taxation of a Participant will not be
deemed material unless such action results in an income tax
penalty on the Participant). Without the approval of
stockholders, the Committee will not amend or replace previously
granted Options or SARs in a transaction that constitutes a
“repricing,” as such term is used in
Section 303A.08 of the Listed Company Manual of the New
York Stock Exchange (if then applicable). With regard to other
terms of Awards, the Committee shall have no authority to waive
or modify any such Award term after the Award has been granted
to the extent the waived or modified term would be mandatory
under the Plan for any Award newly granted at the date of the
waiver or modification. (f) Right of Setoff. The Company or any subsidiary
may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, deduct from and
set off against any amounts the Company or a subsidiary may owe
to the Participant from time to time (including amounts payable
in connection with any Award, owed as wages, fringe benefits,
amounts related to Awards which should have, but have not
previously been, withheld by the Company for tax purposes, or
other compensation owed to the Participant), such amounts as may
be owed by the Participant to the Company, including but not
limited to amounts owed under Section 10(a), although the
Participant shall remain liable for any part of the
Participant’s payment obligation not satisfied through such
deduction and setoff. By accepting any Award granted hereunder,
the Participant agrees to any deduction or setoff under this
Section 11(f). (g) Unfunded Status of Awards; Creation of Trusts. The Plan is intended to constitute an “unfunded” plan
for incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any
payments not yet made to a Participant or obligation to deliver
Stock pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any
Award shall give any such Participant any rights that are
greater than those of a general creditor of the C-14 Table of Contents Company; provided that the Committee may authorize the creation
of trusts and deposit therein cash, Stock, other Awards or other
property, or make other arrangements to meet the Company’s
obligations under the Plan. Such trusts or other arrangements
shall be consistent with the “unfunded” status of the
Plan unless the Committee otherwise determines with the consent
of each affected Participant. (h) Nonexclusivity of the Plan. Neither the adoption
of the Plan by the Board nor its submission to the stockholders
of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any
limitations on the power of the Board or a committee thereof to
adopt such other incentive arrangements, apart from the Plan, as
it may deem desirable, including incentive arrangements and
awards which do not qualify under Code Section 162(m), and
such other arrangements may be either applicable generally or
only in specific cases. (i) Payments in the Event of Forfeitures; Fractional
Shares. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in the
event of a forfeiture of an Award with respect to which a
Participant paid cash consideration, the Participant shall be
repaid the amount of such cash consideration. No fractional
shares of Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the
Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash,
other Awards or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu
of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or
any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated. (j) Compliance with Code Section 162(m). It is
the intent of the Company that Options and SARs granted to
Covered Employees and other Awards designated as Awards to
Covered Employees subject to Section 7 shall constitute
qualified “performance-based compensation” within the
meaning of Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder,
unless otherwise determined by the Committee at the time of
allocation of an Award. Accordingly, the terms of
Sections 7(b) and (c), including the definitions of Covered
Employee and other terms used therein, shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent with Code Section 162(m) and regulations
thereunder. The foregoing notwithstanding, because the Committee
cannot determine with certainty whether a given Participant will
be a Covered Employee with respect to a fiscal year that has not
yet been completed, the term Covered Employee as used herein
shall mean only a person designated by the Committee as likely
to be a Covered Employee with respect to a specified fiscal
year. If any provision of the Plan or any Award document
relating to a Performance Award that is designated as intended
to comply with Code Section 162(m) does not comply or is
inconsistent with the requirements of Code Section 162(m)
or regulations thereunder, such provision shall be construed or
deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such
requirements, and no provision shall be deemed to confer upon
the Committee or any other person discretion to increase the
amount of compensation otherwise payable in connection with any
such Award upon attainment of the applicable performance
objectives. (k) Certain Limitations on Awards to Ensure Compliance
with Code Section 409A. For purposes of this Plan,
references to an award term or event (including any authority or
right of the Company or a Participant) being
“permitted” under Code Section 409A mean, for a
409A Award, that the term or event will not cause the
Participant to be liable for payment of interest or a tax
penalty under Code Section 409A and, for a Non-409A Award,
that the term or event will not cause the Award to be treated as
subject to Code Section 409A. Other provisions of the Plan
notwithstanding, the terms of any 409A Award and any Non-409A
Award, including any authority of the Company and rights of the
Participant with respect to the Award, shall be limited to those
terms permitted under Code Section 409A, and any terms not
permitted under Code Section 409A shall be automatically
modified and limited to the extent necessary to conform with
Code Section 409A. For this purpose, other provisions of
the Plan notwithstanding, the Company shall have no authority to
accelerate distributions relating to 409A Awards in excess of
the authority permitted under Code Section 409A, and any
distribution subject to Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i)
(separation from service) to a “key employee” as
defined under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), shall not
occur earlier than the earliest time permitted under Code
Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i). (l) Certain Limitations Relating to Accounting Treatment
of Awards. Other provisions of the Plan notwithstanding, the
Committee’s authority under the Plan (including under
Sections 8(c), 11(c) and 11(d)) is limited to the extent
necessary to ensure that any Option or other Award of a type
that the Committee has intended to be subject to fixed
accounting with a measurement date at the date of grant or C-15 Table of Contents the date performance conditions are satisfied under APB 25
shall not become subject to “variable” accounting
solely due to the existence of such authority, unless the
Committee specifically determines that the Award shall remain
outstanding despite such “variable” accounting. This
provision shall cease to be effective if and at such time as the
Company elects to no longer account for equity compensation
under APB 25. (m) Governing Law. The validity, construction, and
effect of the Plan, any rules and regulations relating to the
Plan and any Award document shall be determined in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
principles of conflicts of laws, and applicable provisions of
federal law. (n) Awards to Participants Outside the United
States. The Committee may modify the terms of any Award
under the Plan made to or held by a Participant who is then
resident or primarily employed outside of the United States in
any manner deemed by the Committee to be necessary or
appropriate in order that such Award shall conform to laws,
regulations, and customs of the country in which the Participant
is then resident or primarily employed, or so that the value and
other benefits of the Award to the Participant, as affected by
foreign tax laws and other restrictions applicable as a result
of the Participant’s residence or employment abroad shall
be comparable to the value of such an Award to a Participant who
is resident or primarily employed in the United States. An Award
may be modified under this Section 11(n) in a manner that
is inconsistent with the express terms of the Plan, so long as
such modifications will not contravene any applicable law or
regulation or result in actual liability under
Section 16(b) for the Participant whose Award is modified. (o) Limitation on Rights Conferred under Plan. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be
construed as (i) giving any Eligible Person or Participant
the right to continue as an Eligible Person or Participant or in
the employ or service of the Company or a subsidiary,
(ii) interfering in any way with the right of the Company
or a subsidiary to terminate any Eligible Person’s or
Participant’s employment or service at any time (subject to
the terms and provisions of any separate written agreements),
(iii) giving an Eligible Person or Participant any claim to
be granted any Award under the Plan or to be treated uniformly
with other Participants and employees, or (iv) conferring
on a Participant any of the rights of a stockholder of the
Company unless and until the Participant is duly issued or
transferred shares of Stock in accordance with the terms of an
Award or an Option is duly exercised. Except as expressly
provided in the Plan and an Award document, neither the Plan nor
any Award document shall confer on any person other than the
Company and the Participant any rights or remedies thereunder. (p) Severability; Entire Agreement. If any of the
provisions of this Plan or any Award document is finally held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable (whether in whole or in
part), such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent,
but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, and the remaining provisions shall not be
affected thereby; provided, that, if any of such provisions is
finally held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable because it
exceeds the maximum scope determined to be acceptable to permit
such provision to be enforceable, such provision shall be deemed
to be modified to the minimum extent necessary to modify such
scope in order to make such provision enforceable hereunder. The
Plan and any Award documents contain the entire agreement of the
parties with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede
all prior agreements, promises, covenants, arrangements,
communications, representations and warranties between them,
whether written or oral with respect to the subject matter
thereof. (q) Plan Effective Date and Termination. The Plan
shall become effective if, and at such time as, the stockholders
of the Company have approved it by the affirmative votes of the
holders of a majority of the voting securities of the Company
present, or represented, and entitled to vote on the subject
matter at a duly held meeting of stockholders (provided that the
total vote cast on the proposal represents over 50% in interest
of all securities entitled to vote on the proposal). Upon such
approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company, no
further awards shall be granted under the Preexisting Plans, but
any outstanding awards under the Preexisting Plans shall
continue in accordance with their terms. Unless C-16 Table of Contents earlier terminated by action of the Board of Directors, the
authority of the Committee to make grants under the Plan shall
terminate on the date that is ten years after the latest date
upon which stockholders of the Company have approved the Plan,
and the Plan will remain in effect until such time as no Stock
remains available for delivery under the Plan or as set forth
above and the Company has no further rights or obligations under
the Plan with respect to outstanding Awards under the Plan. C-17 Table of Contents APPENDIX D MIDWAY GAMES INC. THIS PROXY IS SOLICITED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE UNDERSIGNED, revoking all previous proxies, hereby appoints DAVID F. ZUCKER, THOMAS E.
